On the left edge of the section in question, it is indicated that the submitted decision of extreme accounting has a minor jump of zero sequence
Asymptotic estimation of integral differential equation of singular deviation
Before two large works
third row with subscript parameter
local extreme calculations for linear differential equations were additionally provided in works [1] with negative roots of the describing equation [23], and for integral differential equations [456] with opposite roots of the describing equation.
This work is designed to investigate the asymptotic set of solutions to nonlinear integral extreme calculations for integral differential equations with negative roots of an additional characterizing equation

The article is intended to study the solution of the Cauchy report for linear differential equations with secondary singular deviations with impulse action
In accordance with the equation given in the article, a system of fundamental solutions of a homogeneous differential equation with impulse action was created and their asymptotic characteristics were obtained
Using these functions, the analytical formula of the considered solution of the Cauchy report is obtained
Using this formula, the theorem on the asymptotic nature of the solution of the report is proved

Diffusion processes arise in the study of heat and mass exchange chemical kinetics and the theory of semiconductors of thermal propagation to burning thin bodies of a dynamic gyroscope, as well as other various processes and phenomena in the study of singularly deviated differential equations

On the other hand, it becomes necessary to analyze mathematical models described through singular differential equations with impulse action at sharp deviations in such systems
Differential equations with impulse action are a new point in the theory of simple differential equations
The study of such equations was initially carried out very slowly
The reason for this is the properties of loss of solution bifurcation autonomy and t
due to the special properties of such pulsed equations
Despite these difficulties, the development of this theory has become widespread in recent years [6-8]
Of great interest to it is the dynamics of the population of theoretical physics of effective management of science and technology of biotechnology production robotics, economics and t.

This article provides for yonson fragments of yonson sets
The main methods of research of this work are the semantic method for yonson theory
Its definition is based on the translation of the theoretical and model properties of the center into its theory
The concept of categoricity is considered one of the most important in model theory
This article explores the numerical and incalculable categoricity of the theory of the occurrence of fragments
Also presented are theorems of existence of the theories under consideration for quantitative "small" models
These are special atomic and autonomous algebraic simple models
Unson theory of onson sets, a fragment of an existential closed categoricity model
This article is intended to study special types of positive theory, which are fragments of some ionson theory
The set X in the theory of T is called yonsonic if it satisfies the following properties:
Set X - S		- a certain internal amount
Where is the simantic model of the theory of S - T
dcl (X) - some existential - main models C closed internal model
total
Define the ionic fragment:
All theories that make up a johnson fragment of a given theory
- in case deductive closure is a theory of yonson
It would be interesting if this was not always obvious, then one could define some part of any theory that would be a yonson theory
Provides the moralization of some theory, which should be the place of such calculations, as well as the obtained theory of at least [1]
[1] determines the fact of applying another path to become a computational model of any inductive theory, necessarily included isomorphically in some existential closed models considered in theory
Next, consider all the true  of this model - sentences
Creates a clear -sөylemderdі yonson theory in the model of an existential dead end, given by a known fact in the conditions of yonson theory
In this case, the resulting yonsonic theory is called the yonsonic fragment of the corresponding yonsonic set.
It is clear that we can study yonson fragments related to the original theory, this will be a new statement of reports on the study of yonson theory
Let us recall the concepts of  category - yonson theory ( -J), which is a fragment of some yonson set
If we replace the definitions considered in the theory [2]  -PJ for some registered , in all  -  continuation - by immersion, then we
- we get the definition of the yonson theory (-J)
This class of theories ( -PJ) can be a positive generalized Neonsonian theory other than theory
Ours
in our case, this is not the case, because extensions are always attachments
In the future, we work only with theories that will be fragments of some yonson sets
Let L be the first ordinal language
At - set of atomic formulas of the given language
(At) all atomic formulas of positive Boolean combinations (conjunctions and disjunctions) of their internal formulas and variables
closed set relative to replacement
Q (B (At)) - normal ( and ) from -
B ( At)	quantifiers	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	using	received	formulas
set
The formula is called positive if its axioms are positive
B (L) is any L
Boolean formula combinations
From here we get in the future only immersion instead of morphism
With B (At), we get the usual Yonson theory
the difference will be positive -aksiomalary
In perspective, the definition of all concepts related to yonson theory is considered known and can be inferred, for example, [2]
The following result can be found in the work of Sapacino [3]:
If L is a numeric language and T is a complete language -teorema
T  -Categorical Model Companion
When studying yonsonic theories, the main tool for studying it is the semantic method
This method is generalized as follows: the elementary properties of the center of ionic theories are "transferred" to their theory
At the same time, the theory of elements of the semantic model of yonson theory is similar to the positive theory of robinson and is an invariant of this yonson theory, since all semantic theories of the same yonson are
models will be equivalent to mutual elements
The following definition belongs to McIntyre [4]
Theory T is full of a positive model if the complete and every existential L-formula of model T is equivalent to some positive existential formula L- in T
The ModT model is called simple in ModT, if for each A
If the V hectare an uncommon morphism, then B  ModT is injective
From the works of Weispf [5] you can extract the following result:
The following conditions are equivalent:
T fully with positive model
T model is complete and each T model is simple in ModT
Positive robinson theory [6] [7] for T yonson theory
It is easy to see that the concept of Kaiser T 0 is a generalization
Positive johnson theory in the presence of the theory of B (At) and -J
It turns out that the concept of a semantic model and a universal domain correspond to [6] [7]
With this remark, we want to prove the result describing the theory of the numerical category  - yonson
T -  -J-theories
Any semantic model T

The following results belong to [8]

Desargues theorem: If the perspective of two tripartite points means that the pairs of their respective walls intersect, then these intersection points are collinear [3]
In the triangles AVS and A'B "C," the walls AV and A'B "VS and B'C" AS and A'C "intersect respectively at points P Q R, then we must prove that these points P Q and R are in the same plane, that is,
Proof: collinear points P Q R

One of the important priorities is to create new opportunities to unlock the potential of Kazakhstanis
We have a lot of work to do to improve the quality of all generations of national education
One of the main aspects of solving this issue is the training of highly qualified pedagogical personnel
Professional training of teachers can be based on the most important principles of vocational training in disciplines mainly in mathematics
Read at the same time
the process should be processed by the relevant parties of future professional activity (sometimes due to inconsistency of unclaimed personality qualities in the educational process and professional activity, the former best student lags behind the average student at the stage of professional and career development)
Professional oriented education in mathematics is an integral part of a competent approach to the mathematical training of future teachers, which effectively contributes to resolving contradictions related to the bilateral position of mathematics in a modern university
By vocational-oriented teaching of mathematics, we mean: the content of educational material and its mastery in the form and form corresponding to the system logic of building a course of mathematics, and provided that the practical tasks of the cognitive and professional activities of the future specialist are reflected
There are three main aspects of professional mathematics training
The first is related to increasing the motivation of mathematics-the second in determining the content of vocational-oriented mathematics education, and the third - to implementing vocational-oriented education and improving the methods of their application
In pedagogical science, the concept of "professional competence" is considered in the following concepts: a set of knowledge and abilities that determine the effectiveness of labor; The scope of job skills; capacity for personal abilities and qualities; a vector of professionalism; unity of practical and theoretical preparation for labor; activities for complex cultural purposes and
ability to implement

The article discusses methods of training students for national art in technology lessons in high school
While the training of future teachers to teach students national art, on the one hand, involves modern socio-economic processes and issues of adaptation to learning, on the other hand, there are deviations in relation to national art among youth due to changing demand and taste for art
Effective and effective methods have been identified for high-quality multidisciplinary activities of the technology teacher
The development and improvement of the quality of the already established traditions of decorative and applied art of professional training in the direction of decorative and applied art is carried out on the basis of improvement
Keywords: integration of informatization of continuing education - new information technologies pedagogical technologies
The Strategic Program of the President of Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan-2030" highlighted the issue of education and education of the younger generation together with the tasks of improving the welfare and security of prosperity of all Kazakhstanis and improving the health of the country
In society, there is a need to train specialists who are able to fully apply their knowledge and skills, a deep understanding of the profession corresponding to the professional training of workers
Because the most important social task of a higher school of any state allows a future specialist to demonstrate his/her capabilities
These tasks are the main prerequisites facing higher educational institutions for the training of professionals [1]
The training of future teachers to teach students national art, on the one hand, involves modern socio-economic trends and issues of adaptation to learning, and on the other, deviations in decorative and applied arts among youth are due to changing demand and taste for art
The mentioned issues on technological support of technology teacher preparation for national art in general education school determined the importance of the following actions [2]:
The selection of conceptual basic and basic pedagogical technologies to adjust the tools and forms of educational knowledge of future technology teachers in accordance with the goals and objectives of preparing future teachers to join the national arts;
didactic and methodological support of educational disciplines in the specialty, taking into account the goals and objectives of training of this specialist;
development of criteria for professional and creative evaluation of the technology teacher in this aspect;
Development of a tool for the implementation of monitoring and evaluation measures in the training of future specialists in higher education institutions
The role of university teachers in the training of teachers of future technologies is of great importance
Therefore, we were convinced that the level of vocational-cultural intellectual and vocational-creative potential of teachers should correspond to the level of complexity of pedagogical tasks solved in the formation of professional training of students for activities to join students in national art
The need for a comprehensive analysis of the pedagogical activity of a technology teacher depends on: preparation of requirements for the organization of educational, educational and creative activities of students when preparing students for national art with the development of criteria for assessing the level of their formation and requirements for control and evaluation measures with the determination of a set of qualifications corresponding to each of the listed types of pedagogical actions, with the justification of the main activities and functions for introducing students to national art, firstly.
The analysis of the pedagogical activity of the technology teacher did not give ready answers to the solution of these problems
In the structure of actions, technology teachers made it possible to identify structural components of actions to involve students in the arts and crafts (Table 1) [3]

Therefore, we were convinced that the level of vocational-cultural intellectual and vocational-creative potential of teachers should correspond to the level of complexity of the solved pedagogical tasks in the formation of professional training of students for the activity of joining students in the arts and crafts
Thus, we analyzed modern methods based on systematic planning and organization of the educational process in vocational educational institutions and processes of development of the system of pedagogical education in Kazakhstan
Table 1 - Structural components of actions to introduce students to decorative and applied arts
This made it possible to identify the basic elements of basic education that characterize the connections and functions of a technology teacher, certain aspects of the process of preparing students for participation in national art
Future Technology Teachers Profession for National Arts Students
Organization of training [4]:
Apply teaching methods that enhance the mind and practice of students and ensure their implementation;
creative search for the performing actions of students in organizing their activities when studying the national art of the Kazakh people;
In the process of teaching national art, teach students introspection and self-esteem, the ability to set goals in working with types of national art, be able to create technical documents to determine criteria for the quality of work, create plans for sorting equipment;
increasing the interest of students in the process of creating national forms of art;
gradually develop the skills and skills of the Kazakh people in the process of mastering national forms of art in a targeted sequence;
cooperation between teachers and parents;
teachers of future technologies constantly updated and improved the teaching methodology for educational materials and national arts of the Kazakh people
The annual work plan of the circle "Art-national internship" was implemented
The purpose of the course is to introduce students to ornaments found in Kazakh national art and teach them to correctly find a solution to an ornamental composition that explains the meaning and meaning of their use
It is also the mastery of embroidery technologies and the enhancement of artistic taste
The results of teachers' responses during the technology lesson were taken into account, special attention was paid to the search for an ornamental composition and color solution when studying the lesson.
Work related to the development of knowledge and skills in the introduction of students to the arts and crafts is being carried out (Table 2) [5]
The concrete results of future teachers in the teaching of arts and crafts are based on a practical-oriented approach, which involves the orientation of students' cognitive and social interest.
In the course of work, innovative technologies, educational means of creative activity are widely used
And he paid special attention to understanding the national arts and crafts and its assessment and respect:
The analysis of scientific literature (philosophical psychological and pedagogical cultural studies) proved the relevance of this issue in pedagogical teaching, that the social situation in the world increases the requirements for transforming the actions of each person into a transformation of the economy and meets the needs of society [6]

This will increase the level of knowledge and business skills of the student in the field of this problem
Preparation of manuals to improve the training of teachers of future technology disciplines in this field
In conclusion, the research problem under consideration does not have the goal of completely solving the problem, since it is complex and multidisciplinary
Development of competencies of art studies of teachers of future technologies and development of web-design skills of teachers of future technologies to identify compositional solution of national art products

In practice, it was found that laser radiation not only creates coloring centers in alkaline-halide crystals, but also destroys them during single-photon transitions
Removal can be caused by ionization of G-centers or destabilization of the intermediate halide
It was considered and established that various mechanisms for the degradation of colorful centers are associated with optical destabilization V2-ortalyғynyң
Destabilization of the intermediate halide of the alkaline-halide crystal node of the color centers
When the amount of light is accumulated in nonlinear processes or materials are painted under the influence of radiation, the destabilizing effect of excitatory radiation is controlled, that is, the attenuation of active radiation leads to a decrease in the amount of light or the number of color centers [12]
This phenomenon is noticeable in alkaline-halide crystals (SHA) with double photon (multi-ton) formation of color centers and direct absorption of single-photon destroying energy of the formed centers [3]
Some patterns of laser excitation of SGC, identified by the method of exoemission of thermoluminescence and absorption [3], but some of its remarkable features, left out, will be discussed in this article
Experience Methodologies and Key Results
During the experiment, transparent or pre-stained (X-ray or additive) crystals were periodically measured with prolonged laser radiation irradiation of the absorbed radiation spectrum
Chlorine-xenon excimer ELI-1 laser is used as source of colouring radiation
Laser pulse energy 20 60 mJ pulse duration 20 repetition frequency ns 10 Hz
This is the result of all photochemical reactions - double photon absorption, since the energy of laser photons (4024 eV) corresponds to the investigated zone of transparency of the SHA
Step-by-step attenuation through shock glass filters for irradiation of crystals with a laser cabin of various intensities (in the energy flow zone from 1 50 MVtsm-2)
The cross section of the light flux on the surface with focusing of laser radiation on the object and the corresponding color do not exceed 12 mm2
The concentration of G-centers in the center of the spot on a surface with a uniformly colored area of ​ ​ 025 mm2 without gradient is determined by the optical density of the maximum absorption band G
The object of the study was KCl KBr KI and NaCl volume 551 mm3, isolated from monocrystal grown from a cleaner powder by the Kiropoulos method, as well as KCl: K crystal, additive stained in a potassium joint with a concentration of G-centers 961016 cm-3
The dependence of t and I on the intensity of the concentration of G-centers for n time is similar to each other in all examined objects
Figure 1 shows the relationships n = f (tI) in KCl and KCl: K crystals
Growing curves originally referred to transparent crystals, and slowing ones to preliminary X-rays
corresponds to crystals stained with radiation
With prolonged irradiation from Figure 1, it can be observed in all cases that, depending on the intensity of light and in proportion to it, an equilibrium concentration of G-centers is formed
Concentration of painting centers on objects irradiated with X-rays	color centers exceeding the equilibrium concentration of the same intensity are destroyed
KCl: K does not have stable (additive) G-centers
But the radiation formation and destruction of G-centers at this facility is no different from transparent crystals both in quality and in quantity
This can be controlled by superimposing a change in the concentration of dye centers caused by exposure to radiation on a graph of the level of additive G centers
In the following practice, laser radiation is used to create repainting centers
After irradiating the crystal to saturation with a certain energy density, the energy density is reduced, the evolution of the paint centers for the CBD crystal after such changes is shown in Figure 2
These dependencies prove that the results outlined above are correct
However, there are differences that require additional discussion
The set of constraints specified in Figure 2 can be expressed using a simple equation [3]
where C1 C2 - constant values for examined objects
The first term on the right corresponds to an increase in the concentration of coloring centers by n - elimination
It is assumed that the growth is proportional to the absorbed energy (I2 for a double photon process), and the removal is proportional to the amount of absorption of laser radiation of the resulting dyeing centers
Here, the attenuation of the laser beam in the past through the crystal is not taken into account, since the attenuation is less than that taken into account in double photon absorption, and the reduced absorption coefficient hv = 402 eV does not exceed several cm-1 and does not create significant losses at the thickness of the object  1mm
(1) solving the equation
limit 
that is, proportional to intensity I according to experience n
Discussion of results
The results of the above experience indicate the existence of a mechanism that causes their destruction during the accumulation of colorful centers
Determine the cause of the processes shown in the figure based on these results and identified data
From the decomposition of the energy of the anionic exciton formed by absorption of light or recombination of the electron and the defect, a stable G-center of the SGC is formed with a mobile N-center or unstable centers  - and I - (space and intermediate anion)
A pair of GH centers is formed when atoms merge with molecules or when creating defects in anions of a more complex crystal lattice [45]
According to the assumption of some authors [5] intermediate halide T 250 K knot
[100] consists of V2 centers directed along
It was found that the annihilation of nucleotide GG-H pairs of HGC during heating is carried out as a result of a tunneling phenomenon in a short time after their formation between nodal intermediate halides or optical ionization of G-centers
In the latter case, the G-center
electron retention in the accumulated halide is a moving anion, that is, corrects the I-center and is recombined by the void left by the electron
In this case, the moving gap T ≥ 250 K itself can diffuse to halide [67]
In addition, there is an assumption that optical destabilization of the intermediate halide (V2-center), which is only relevant when laser irradiation of coloring centers, can be carried out.
Figure 1- Dependence of G-center concentration in KCl (ab) and KCl-K crystals irradiated with transparent (1) and preliminary X-ray (2) radiation on irradiation time
Laser power 22 (a) 8 (b) 12 (v) mW/cm2
Figure 2 - Figure of G-centers in CBD chip	change of limit concentration from reduction of laser power (18-64) mW/cm2 (1) and (9-32) mW/cm2 (2)
Partial disruption of their structure (destruction) with the prolonged isothermal accumulation of coloring centers occurs due to the influence of conductor electrons or due to the instability of the halide optically, since electrons are also formed from the ionization of G-centers along with double photon absorption
Clearly, the number of wire electrons formed in double photon transitions is proportional to the absorbed energy or square of light intensity
If wire electrons destabilize B2-orty, then (1) at the second member on the right of the equation has to be size І2
Then, under limit conditions (3) n (I), light will depend on intensity I
This situation is excluded due to inconsistencies in the results of practice
If the structural processes of disturbance are reduced by the number of photoelectrons (an electron from an empty place) in G-centers, then in the case of additive color (1), the concentration of G-centers introduced during additive color should be written in the form of a second term C2 (n + n0) Idt to the right of the equation
According to which t (3) differs from the solution of the equation
where n (I) is the concentration of defects caused by radiation, to it n0
value not included
n (I) not less than zero
or
if new radiation defects occur, the minimum intensity limit determined by the equation (7), in which no colour centres are formed, shall be the minimum value
Comparing the dependencies ab and v in Figure 1, it can be seen that more than ten times the value of stable (additive) G-centers does not significantly affect the processes of neoplasm of coloring centers
Thus, we see the predominant optical destabilization of the inter-node halide, since conductivity does not affect the structural destruction of electron V2-ortalyқtarynyң caused by the double photon transition and ionization of G-centers
The number of V2-ortalyқtarynyң in dyed KCl crystals and additive KCl due to radiation exposure will be approximately the same, so the rate of their reduction is also comparable
at h = 402 eV, the absorption coefficient of V2-ortalyқtarynyң is much higher than the absorption coefficient of G-centers (102 times)
You can define the magnitude of equation (1).
From this it can be seen that the amount of V2-ortalyқtarynyң or inter-node halide is proportional to the number of G-centers generated by radiation
In samples irradiated with X-rays from experimental dependencies (Figure 1), a minimum concentration of G-centers is observed
When exposed to laser radiation of CBD crystal irradiated with X-ray radiation, also set minimums [3]
From this it follows that laser radiation with greater efficiency destroys the centers of irregular color formed by irradiation with X-rays, which complements the new stable centers of color
If the centers of excessive color are formed under the influence of laser radiation, then (2) the minima corresponding to the equation are not controlled (Figure 2)
In the first case (Figure 2 dependence 1) to crystal saturation of 18 MVtsm-2 at energy density with subsequent decrease of intensity to 64 MVtsm-2
In the second case (2 dependencies), 9 MVtsm-2 were produced for the limit value of the dyeing centers and 32 MVtsm-2 in the energy density.
It has been tested that one of the possible assumptions for determining the nature of this difference is the polarization of laser radiation or the possibility of predominance of B2 centers
In this case, the sample irradiated to saturation is clogged with low intensity radiation of 900 turns
The resulting dependency is completely the same as Figure 2, i.e. not controlled by any minimum, so this forecast is considered invalid
Therefore, in practice, no attempt has been made to determine the differences between the X-ray and laser colour centres.
In the absorption spectrum formed by X-rays and laser rays, slight differences were observed [89], but their informativity is less
When irradiated with laser beams of crystals painted in various (radiation and additive) ways, double photon absorption not only created new color centers, but also eliminated them during single-photon transitions
It can be concluded that the main reason for the destruction of the resulting color centers is optical destabilization V2-ortalyқtarynyң

Scientific article provides for the study of complex transportation processes
Stationary and non-stationary conditions are analyzed in this direction
The study of such complex phenomena discussed the application of advanced methods of thermodynamics of irreversible processes
Thermodynamic equations characterizing formation processes are given
Based on them, differential equations are given that characterize three processes (thermal imaging mass transfer and deformation) on solids
Analytical solution of the differential equation for the case of linear natural change of the potential for mass photography
Methods for determining potential emitter coefficients of samples (substances) are indicated
As an example, the values of the potential strength factor for mass pumping and the ways of determining its dependence on temperature are briefly described.
Conditions of non-thermal reality, Mass exchange dynamics of the process
Today it is widely known that complex transport processes taking place under different conditions have a wide place in nature in technology and science and education.
At a time when each of these processes was studied separately, these days there is a wide opportunity to comprehensively study complex transport processes, which can be simultaneously blocked in one system or on the body using advanced methods of thermodynamics of irreversible processes.
Let's try to first look at a simple situation
It is proved that in the system or body there is a thermal imaging or mass photography (diffusion), for example, the process of transporting a certain nature
In accordance with the Onzager principle, to describe the process of such frontal transport taking place under stationary conditions, the following equation can be written [1-3]
where q is the intrinsic flow (flow density) L is the kinetic coefficient X is the driving thermodynamic force
A coefficient characterizing the specific flow capacity of the medium from the generalized expression (1) (e.g., thermal conductivity coefficient t).
) and as a thermodynamic driving force, you can write the Fick equations for Fourier mass (diffusion) for a coolant with a gradient of the corresponding potential, and for internal friction of the Newton equation
Now, when two transport processes of different nature take place in a system or body, for example, heating and mass pumping, according to the first and second Onzager principles, a system of equations [1-2] can be used to describe such complex transport processes:
where
q1 and
Members corresponding to thread index q2 have
description of relative forces and coefficients, and the remaining second terms
characterizes the impact of processes on the main flows under consideration
For example, thermal conductivity of mass shooting and vice versa
In this case, in accordance with the second Onzager principle, that is, the principle of mutual equality, the following equality occurs [1]:
Thus, for three processes that take place simultaneously in one system or body, you can write the following system of equations:
Now, summarizing these words, for any process that will overlap in the system, you can write the following equation:
The results of scientific work carried out in subsequent years show that the influence of processes occurring in the system on the main phenomenon can be taken into account through effective values ​ ​ of kinetic coefficients and thermodynamic forces [45]
In this question, there can be three cases: taking into account the influence of phenomena occurring in the layer on the main process through effective values ​ ​ of kinetic coefficients (Lef) (first)
situation); their accounting through effective values of thermodynamic forces (Hef) (second case); consideration of the facts of such interaction through effective values of both kinetic coefficient and thermodynamic force (third case)
We can say that the correctness of the last third case found its basis, since in fact they will both be revealed during the experiment (Lef Hef).
With respect to the processes under consideration,
streams (q1-heat stream)
q2 -mass flow and
q3 - eformation flow)
Using spectacular values, you can obtain the following equations:
Above we were talking about transportation processes in a simple hospital
In real conditions, these processes are complicated mainly in non-stationary conditions
Let's talk about these questions
It is proved that on the surface of a system or body at the same time there is an alternation of three portable processes with different nature
In particular, thermal insulation and thermal deformation
As an object of study in which similar phenomena occur, for example, ceramic materials with a sleeve can be obtained.
These transport processes are complicated in parallel by the phase chemical transformations that take place during the heating process along such samples, as well as the effect on each other
A number of them (for example, dehydration dissociation processes)
) complicates transport phenomena in models associated with thermal effects
In such systems, deformation equations have been obtained characterizing complex transport processes occurring on bodies in previous works [56]:
where T-temperature  - thermal conductivity coefficient a - metabolism  - specific heat of phase or chemical transformations, specific heat capacity U - relative related thing (for example, water in a crystalline bond)
mass  - coefficient of thermal increase (settlement) of sample  - in front
AU - Transportation	for	potential conductivity	coefficient	 -
thermal gradient coefficient  - kinetic viscosity coefficient
Now, as we have said above, the effect of repetitive processes on each other is expressed through the effective values ​ ​ of potential coefficients and thermodynamic driving forces (potential gradients) (Lef Xef)
from equations (11) to (13) for one-dimensional (x-coordinate) processes we obtain:
Effective values of potential sensitivity coefficients in these equations (aef aUef  ef) today can be determined by practical ways [78]
Now, based on the theoretical questions discussed above, we consider ways to systematically describe the dynamics of complex mass pumping (diffusion) processes occurring during physicochemical transformations in ceramic samples of coniferous strips
From previous experiments [79] in these samples, the zonal mechanism of physicochemical transformations (processes of dehydration dissociation), which is diffusion, was revealed.
If there are necessary conditions for such transformations (temperature pressure
), which began on the surfaces of the model and moved into the inner layers at known speeds, and the transformations (reactions) on the thin surfaces showed that the process speed is limited by the diffusion output of their products (gaseous) to the environment through the outer layers
In short, the physicochemical transformations under consideration are diffusion.
However, it is known from experience that in accordance with the law of change of potential (T U ) in transportation processes after a short time, potential changes in other layers begin to pass with the same law [35]
This is an analytical acquisition of solutions to the above differential equations in the conditions of the first border agreement
the word "will"
For example, in the case of a linear natural change in the potential (U) for mass photography (15), the following solution to the equation can be obtained:
where VU - rate of change of relative mass of substance in P- bonds
determining measurement (half thickness of infinite plate-plate and half of infinite cylinder and radius for ball) G = 0 for infinite plate of constant value, and cylinder - G = 1 a ball G = 2
The sign preceding the second term to the right of the given equation (17) is positive or negative depending on the beginning of the census (page or center of the sample) obtained by the coordinate (x)
To describe the dynamics of mass pumping processes in ceramic samples of the brush-shaped cavity according to equation (17), it is necessary to know the values ​ ​ of the effective potential coefficient (aUef) (diffusion coefficient)
As a result of numerous physical experiments [7-9] various ceramic
diffusion-related physicochemical transformations on samples (dehydration dissociation of combustion
) with a comprehensive study of the kinetics of moving mass transfer processes, the values ​ ​ of the effective potency coefficient are determined at large temperature intervals (400-1400K)
The result of these works is the dependence of the potential strength factor for mass pumping on temperature
Arrienus showed that the law is characterized in a satisfactory state:
where
a0 - constant value of E-activation energy for the corresponding process
stability
Values of a0 E in the given equation (18) are determined by experimental ways
For example, dehydration (800-1200K) in samples made with plastic molding from monothermite mud raw materials, diffusion with decomposition of water in a crystal-chemical bond in a soil mineral in the temperature range
exit to the road) values a0  41810 of m/s for process and E = 90000Zh/mol
ownership defined
When describing the dynamics of mass transfer processes under isothermal conditions in such samples, it is possible to effectively apply equation (17) to obtain a value of the potential resistance coefficient at a certain temperature.
As is known, the analytical solution of the differential equation is difficult due to the change in the potential conductivity coefficient (18) given in expression (15), and under non-thermal conditions
Therefore, mass transport in this case
value of field (17) in equation
can be described through nerves
This method can also be used in quantitative modeling
Used as an algorithm for computing practices (15)
differential differential equation scheme
in value definition (18)
expression can be performed using
Work is currently under way on the
we conduct
We anticipate that the results of this work will be published in the future
Another point of the above theoretical questions is the following:
When studying the known transportation processes, you can display a reverse report with a practical record of the potential fields describing them
That is, (14) - (16) using analytical solutions of differential equations obtained under the conditions of a given actual contract, determine the values ​ ​ of the potency coefficients of the model (substance) and their dependence on temperature
things happen
So, for example, for mass shooting

Thus, these theoretical materials can be used only in the field of education, and not in science and practice
For example, for specialties, "Physics" can be the basis for the development of a new computer physical workshop based on computing practices

Polytetrafluoroethylene is widely used in many production regions and in technology
Polytetrophluoroethylene surfaces were examined using an atomic force microscope
For this, a stationary plant is used - Nanoeducator 2
Obtained a fluoroplastic film with a thickness of 075 mm 50 × 50 nm and a size of 100 × 100 nm
Samples of this size were prepared and obtained two-dimensional surface and three-dimensional three-dimensional drawings of the surface of the fluoroplastic film
Polytetrophluoroethylene atomic force microscope optical spectroscopy of fluoroplast
Introduction
Polymers by structure are divided into three main groups - linear branches and cross-linked
Polytetrafluoroethylene linear group	belongs
Its macromolecules consist of monomer groups of one or more types with a long sequential controlled and unsettled chemical bond
X-ray diffraction studies have shown that molecular collisions with polytetrafluoroethylene are close to a tricline below 292 K
The transverse boom of molecules is almost hexagonal, but the plane of the main simple cells is inclined to the molecular axis
Crystalline degree about 90% [1]
Currently, polytetrafluoroethylene is used in electrical and space projects so that parts with a thickness of, for example, do not transfer current to the winding of the wire
Chemical name - polytetrafluoroethyl production name of fluoroplast - teflon
Fluoroplastic films in production are packed in high-voltage wires
In addition, the fluoroaplast is an ideal antifriction and particularly sufficient heat insulating polymer.
Fluoroplasts are not glued with any glue
Polytetrophluoroethylene is made in the form of glue and does not lose its properties for alkalis and concentrated acids and other reagents [2]
Methodology of experience
In this work, the surface of the film of polytetrafluoroethylene or fluoroplast - 4 (the more popular name is Teflon) was photographed through an atomic power microscope
Research of fluoroplastic film of Kazakh National University named after Al-Farabi
Conducted at the National Open Nanotechnology Laboratory
Fluoroplastic film thickness 075 mm dimensions 50 × 50 nm and 100 × 100 nm
Chemical formula - (-C 2 F 4 -)
Polytetrafluoroethylene belongs to the linear group
Its macromolecules consist of a monomer group of one or more types with a long sequential ordered and unsettled chemical bond
Length of such circuits 102-104 nm horizontally 03-075 nm
white thermonuclear polymer with polytetrafluoroethylene in which all polyethylene hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine [2]
Automated confocal and probe Raman Scattering (CC) microscope for broad investigation
Measurements using a blue laser wavelength? = 473 nm spot diameter 2 μm
is an atomic force microscope microscope combined with a confocal KH/fluorescence microscope and spectroscope (Figure 1)
Crystal structures and their directions using the confocal CC spectroscopy method give information about the presence of a mixture and the chemical composition of defects
- allows measurement directly through the optical microscope base
The full spectrum of KN/fluorescence is recorded at each point of the object under investigation and is accompanied by program treatments
Due to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional propagation of spectral characteristics of the high-quality optical system, the characteristics of the sample are examined closer to the theoretical degree of permissibility in space
Figure 1 - Atomic power microscope
The basis of the work of the atomic power microscope is the mutual force effect between the probe and the surface layer of the sample, special zone sensors are supported for recording
Sensor - with sharp probe at the ends of the dynamic console
The force affecting the probe from the surface causes the cantilever to bend
By fixing the bending value, it is possible to control the mutually beneficial force between the surface and the probe
The quality of the atomic force microscope can be explained by an example of the Van der Waals force
The Lennardo-Jones potential in the van der waals energy of the mutual action of two atoms located at a distance from each other is always -
via rank function:
The first connecting rangefinder in a given expression describes gravitation, which is mainly proved by the dipole-dipole attraction between atoms
Takes into account the rolling of atoms on the second connective subspace
parameter r0 - equilibrium between atoms U0- minimum energy value
The Lennardo-Jones potential allows you to evaluate the strength of the interaction between the probe and the sample
The real interaction of the probes with the sample is very complex, but the main effects are maintained - the atomic power microscope experiences gravitation of the probe at a large distance along the sample, and skating at short distances
Obtaining atomic force microscope of surface layer relief image is connected with fixing dynamic small bending of probe sensor console
For this atomic force microscope, an optical method is used
The optical system of the atomic power microscope naturally focuses on the area sensor console of radiation of the semiconductor laser, and the reflected shock (node) should fall into the center of the photoseason zone of the photodetector
Four-part semiconductor photodiode is used as position photodetector (Figure)
Figure 2 - Diagram of optical registration of bending of the console of the probe sensor of the atomic force microscope
1234 - semiconductor four-part photodiode
When scanning the template, Δ Z = const zond moves along the surface layer, and the voltage in the Z-electrode on the scanner is recorded in computer memory as the relief of the front layer Z = f (xy)
The tolerance of the atomic force microscope in space is determined depending on the radius of bending of the probe and the sensitivity of the console deflection recorder system
Currently, ACM structures have been created that can obtain atomic resolution for the study of surface layers
The probe when scanning the surface layer first goes in a straight line, that is, along a line, and then in the reverse direction (branch escape) then goes to the next point
The movement of the probe with the help of a scanner is made no more than under the influence of beekeeping voltage made using digital - similar converters
Recording of information on surface layer relief is performed in direct transition according to rules [3]
Results of the study

Conclusion
The surface arrangement of the fluoroplastic film taken for examination was scanned with an atomic force microscope
For this, samples of fluoroplastic film with a thickness of 075mm and dimensions of 100 × 100 nm 50 × 50 nm were made.
As a result, images of the surface of a fluoroplastic film with a size of 2D and 3D were obtained.
Note that the surface relief of the fluoroplastic film is slippery
Maximum height drop from 100 × 100 nm figures in 2D 4 format in Figure a) and c) 1643 nm, and minimum - 2677nm
In 3 2D images, you can see the maximum height drop of 717 nm, and the minimum - 1282 nm
We compare the structure and properties of the fluoroplastic film studied in the future with the obtained two- and three-dimensional patterns applied to the surface of the fluoroplastic film after irradiation through an atomic power microscope using an accelerated electron

The article gives important characteristics of educational portals
Education portal Kazakhstan As a result of the analysis of Russian general education portals and educational portals of other countries, the main activity of the training portal with the accumulation of positive experience and certain types of teaching activities will be determined
Information and communication environment of remote learning portals of new information technologies
In general, the concept of a portal is ambiguous
As is known, the portal is a reasonable tool for selecting sources of resource pooling information for providing a network television and radio company with a developed user interface and a wide range of services and links to creating instant messages, through a simple interface to indicating and configuring this direction.
Modern Internet portals are quite large and complex network information technology complexes focused on the provision of reference analytical and other information services
The most important characteristics of educational portals are [1]:
filling for users - the portal consumer's place is assigned to individual users or a community or a portal independent of it should allow you to individually configure the content and additional interfaces of your appearance for each;
organization of the consumer's place of work - the user's place of work, which allows avoiding overload of information, should be the most convenient and organized in a combined form;
allocation of resources - ensuring that the portal can be divided into several levels so that signatures of different categories of users are achieved
For example, only managers can connect to some levels
The portal interface ensures the identity of users, that is, the creation of an interaction map with a single authentication registration on the server and t
of the Republic of Kazakhstan;
work monitoring is a significant characteristic of a particular person to reproduce a portal assigned at the beginning of operation of the portal, and increases as information about its interests accumulates;
displaying information from the database and creating active communication - from many heterogeneous sources (from multidimensional databases with recorded data from document management systems from Web servers and news channels t
) the ability of the portal to ensure the display and communication of information is also considered a fundamental factor;
information isolation and discovery - the search engine used provides subject-related experts with tools and tools that can also actively find and communicate to communities and content
Given the diversity of facilities with computer technology and telecommunications infrastructure, education should provide, among other things, almost equal opportunities for different facilities in the region, regardless of the degree of facilities
In addition, the organization of the work of the pedagogical and administrative staff of educational institutions should be equipped with an understandable interface and not require deep special training to carry out their professional duties through this environment.
During the study, it was found that the organization of forums and the management of joint projects and seminars with the distribution of packages of curricula and programs of the unified training manual make it possible to organize an effective environment for the implementation of testing systems for practical and laboratory classes and technological education systems of others.
Consider the general education portal of Russia, which became the laureate of the 2008 Prize of the Government of Russia in the educational zone [2] (Figure 1)
Photo 1 - The main window of the basic federal educational portal of Russia
This window opens the window, as in Table 1, if you select the general education portal of Russia

A total of 444 sites will be released
There are also educational portals of the Republic of Kazakhstan (table 2)
Table 2 - Educational portals of the Republic of Kazakhstan
One of these sites is a distance learning system used in the training process at the departments of Moodle universities [3] (Figure 3)
Figure 3 - first page of the portal
This distance learning system will be used for the development programme
Its goal is to study the basics of building educational disciplines in accordance with the Moodle distance learning system and methodical support for the qualitative analysis of professional development and self-education experience
The development programme provides ready-to-use methodologies for the application of achievements in the information and communications technology training process
The content of the program takes into account the current concepts and existing difficulties of e-learning
The program is aimed at scientific and pedagogical workers of higher professional education institutions
Training period 12 number of days 72 hours
Training process ends with final project work
At the end, the students are issued a certificate of advanced training
It was also established that the educational portal is a complex human-machine software-information complex for the placement and use of ready-made information, as well as other information designed to improve the organization of the distributed scientific, methodological and educational process, and their management in various institutions to provide information to various categories of users
The main goal of creating and developing the portal is information and methodological support for the activities of subjects of the educational process
For this, the educational portal should become an effective tool for creating the authority of the educational system as a comprehensive open tool for the accumulation and use of distributed educational resources
Portal of Education As you know, the recruitment of teachers and various categories of students with information and methodological materials is a system that performs the task of integrating the experience of innovative work in educational institutions
The main objective of the educational portal, designed for the remote interaction of subjects of the educational process, is to provide the needs in the educational process with meeting all the necessary conditions on the basis of optimal use of available distributed information resources of the scientific and pedagogical direction
In this regard, the basic services of the training portal are provided, which are presented in Figure 4
Figure 4 - Basic services of the educational portal
From here, the portal shows that the complex human-machine software-information complex of education is a special infrastructure of automation and improvement of the education management system, which requires a set of conditions for preparation and effective operation of the portal to improve the quality of information-methodological and technological staffing of the educational process
As a compiler of the education system, the portal can ensure the collection and preparation of a set of high-quality educational and teaching materials and free interaction with them through effective mechanisms for searching the Internet resources of its own and external education
Information and communication technology is a set of ways of transmitting information provided by users in any form using modern means of communication, providing information interaction both at the local level (for example, within one or more organizations) and within the framework of the global Internet information network (symbolic text graphic audio-video information)
The information and communication environment of the Portal consists of means and technologies of transfer (dissemination) and selection of media recovery tools with knowledge of information from numerous information forms and links between them, as well as organizational structures supporting information interaction with information processes [4]
Changes and improves the activities of society, including with the creation of an information and communication environment
Building an information and communication environment requires the use of client-server technologies
The information required to run the system is stored on the server computer and accessed through the client application (s)
The implementation of this technology requires the creation of a structural model necessary for the portal of three sections, in which the client-user database server (client level) is also a data logic information protection system, a middle-tier application server
On-demand application server queries the Data Foundation server, which optimizes customer preparation and related service
Applications allocated to individual fragments reduce the load on both the client machine and the Data Fund server by transporting the corresponding methods to a special application server
Educational Portal Russia All-Russian general education portal All-Russian Internet Pedagogical Council Internet-state teachers Network of creative teachers Sector schools European school sector As a result of the analysis of the work of domestic and foreign educational communities, such as the educational portal of Great Britain Germany Sweden Canada and other countries, gained positive experience
The following individual types of teaching activities are defined:
remote counselling;
remote training;
remote Olympiad;
visits to forums;
discussion of lesson plans;
exchange of experience in the implementation of network projects;
work of moderators, leading headings, etc.
It was established that the educational portal should take into account that providing information and methodological materials for teachers and students of various categories is a system that performs a mission to integrate the experience of innovative work in educational institutions
It was also established that in the process of teaching teachers are new information technologies for organizing interaction with distance students and ensuring conditions for meeting the needs of students based on the effective use of the allocated information resources of the current scientific and pedagogical purpose

A Framework for Information Management in Canadian Government Institutions has been adopted to implement common information fund management practices
It is aimed exclusively at ensuring the protection of state information
It does not say anything about information constituting commercial or bank personal secrecy
The Concept provides comprehensive explanations on the necessary issues of management of state information and state information funds
The document contains the following thematic chapters:
access to public information;
accessibility of information and communication technologies;
classifiers and thesauruses;
electronic publication of information;
e-mail usage;

The Framework for Public Information Management includes a strategic section with defined basic objectives and principles and an internship methodology with trained instructions and standards
Speaking about Australia's experience in this area, the National Archives signed the Archives Act (1983).
) performs a managerial function in the management of documents in the relevant government institutions, issues regulatory documents in the field of archival affairs
In 1996, Australia adopted for the first time in the world the National Electronic Document Management Standard, which contains instructions for working with traditional paper documents and new electronic documents
Unlike other countries, Australia has more rational aspects of its experience
The Australian Archive is the responsibility of the Australian Archive
It was established in 1983 under the Archives Act and has been called the National Archives of Australia since 1998.
The Law on Archives allows citizens to access state documents 30 years from the date of drawing up documents, that is, in accordance with the Law on Freedom of Information Act 1982 - the issue of freedom of use of documents by state bodies has been resolved
In accordance with the confidentiality of information related to personal life in certain cases (Privacy Act 1988) - ensures the legality of the use of personal documents in the activities of state bodies, as well as the acquaintance of citizens with them
The National Archives, in a senior position in the management of government records in the Australian Union, began producing important regulatory projects from the management of electronic documents and archival affairs previously two other leaders - the US National Archives and the National Bank of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
So, already in 1995, the Australian Archive published books such as "Electronic Document Management," and in 1997, "Electronic Mail Management as a Document" [5]
According to the Australian concept of "electronic document management" (Records management) is a subject aimed at meeting the important needs of the business of the state and society, and the organizational function of electronic document management
Work with electronic documents is distributed as follows:
document continuum management (Records Continuum) - a graphical and theoretical model that includes vertical and interconnected work with documents from the moment these documents appear (previously - when creating a system for designing the work of an electronic document) to storage and use as an archive
Rules for the creation and storage of an electronic document in the industry known as the recording region, that is, from the design of the electronic document handling system to the termination of the existence of the document;
Ensuring the provision of management services and the use of documents to meet the needs and protect the interests of institutions and their staff;
the creation of fully reliable and capable documents providing information from the activities of institutions;
managing documents as valuable property and information;
implementation of a rational organization in the management of documents for improving quality, as well as the activities of the general institution by correctly establishing practical work on working with documents
The value of the Australian electronic document management model is defined in the acronym CADSS, which includes five main functions for effective document management

In the UK, the official document "Modernization of Public Administration" is the basic element in the management of electronic records (documents)
The Government intends to transfer all central government agencies for 2004 to electronic storage and indexing of its information funds to meet e-work requirements
In 2002, the UK State Archives developed functional requirements for electronic document management systems
UK firms that set up an electronic document management system are being tested in the National Archives, interested in evaluating their software in accordance with these requirements
Testing of such software products is also available in US practice [6]
In conclusion, a comparative analysis of the automation of the management of electronic documents abroad shows that the work on electronic documents carried out in the country is aimed at meeting the final needs of the state in society and business and individuals.
It became known that the combination of traditional signatures and electronic digital signatures with paper documents and electronic documents in electronic document management in state bodies of the country is similar to foreign experience
At the same time, systematic study of foreign experience in the management of electronic documents in the future showed the need to effectively use its results in organizations of Kazakhstan
Dynamic development of Kazakhstan as a permanent member of the world association manifests itself in the introduction of new innovative projects into a single documented information space of organizations
And the application of international standards for the management of electronic documents has a successful place in the management system of quality management of domestic organizations and manufacturers

This article pays special attention worldwide to the issues of creating an inclusive society and fully integrating citizens with disabilities into the public environment and finding ways to solve these problems
The main problem of discussion is the improvement of the level of education and the ability of such categories of people to work
The issue under consideration is broad in scope
According to the UN, the number of people with physical and mental disorders is more than 450 million people around the world
Of these, more than 200 million children with disabilities
Access to vocational education for people with disabilities is especially highlighted by the most developed countries of the world, especially through distance learning technology
Higher education an inclusive society of information and communication technologies
Currently, the issue of full integration of citizens with disabilities into the public environment is being considered with special activity in the world and are looking for ways to solve these problems
First of all, the subject of discussion is the creation of conditions for the full integration and education of such categories of people into labor activities.
dated 17 January 2014 N
From Nazarbayev's Address to the People of Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan Way - 2050: A Single Goal - A Single Future"
Fifth, our citizens with disabilities should pay more attention to
For them, Kazakhstan should become a barrier-free zone
We should have less concern for such people - it is our duty to ourselves and society
This is what the whole world does
People with disabilities will be able to work at agricultural enterprises of the food industry and consumer services
I instruct all entrepreneurs to employ them
I want to say again: help
It is also possible to consider the possibility of introducing a special quota for 5-10 people
We involve them in active life, they not only receive benefits, but will also feel useful workers in society
To all our social institutes, non-governmental organizations, Nr Otan party it is necessary to get to this work
If necessary, the Government needs to work on this issue together with all companies and make an appropriate decision
I instruct the Government to increase the amount of social benefits for disability and loss of the breadwinner by 25% from July 1, 2015
There is a need to improve the legal framework for associations of persons with disabilities
"special attention should be paid to people with disabilities [1]
So society began to understand and perceive the importance of developing inclusive education of civil servants and international organizations
Inclusive education will allow people with disabilities to receive the same education in general education schools in their place of residence
Issues at the core of the educational policy of our country - improvement and improvement of the quality of professional training, radical renewal of the scientific and methodological system for providing knowledge, changing the types of forms and methods of training, closing the gap between best educational practices and the needs of modern society, differentiating innovation in education, enhancing its role in ensuring continuity in the process of improving knowledge and the ability to apply modern technology and technologies at a high level
Despite the fact that the law "On Education" states that all children have a general secondary education, unfortunately, the issue of teaching people with disabilities remains relevant
One of the achievements of science in education and education of people with disabilities is the mastery of new technologies and the use of a computer
When using a computer, you can take into account the didactic capabilities of cognitive processes; the formation of a logical system of thinking, the creation of conditions for creative work of mental activity and interest in education
Because vision is, of course, a special impression.
Given that every citizen of our state is every child of national value - this is the future of our country, we must create conditions for the formation of every person with disabilities with a high-quality education.
Although one person with disabilities should understand that improving the quality of education is a fund that is now accumulating in the conscious prospects of the nation
Inclusive education is also an integral part of UNESCO's work "Education for All"
This program was approved by the UN General Assembly and included in the UN Convention on December 13, 2006
The issue of inclusive education begins abroad in 1970, and by the 90s the United States and Europe had fully implemented this program in their educational policy
And the development of the system of inclusive education in our country is an official fact of the development of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan	In the State Program for 2011-2020
Development of inclusive education: modular education programmes for people with disabilities by 2015; Rules for the combined education of persons with disabilities in general education are being developed; By 2020, schools will be equipped with ramps with lifting equipment for the disabled, special desks with handles for installing special devices in sanitary rooms and other compensation tables
barrier-free zones will be created with facilities
The program will also create conditions for equal access to education for children with disabilities
Today, most people with disabilities studying at home are provided with computer equipment
This question is different in scope
Because according to the UN, the number of people with physical and mental disorders around the world
More than 40 million people
Of these, more than 200 million children with disabilities
In the Republic of Kazakhstan 150 thousand children with disabilities - 4 thousand - from 3-6 thousand to 33 thousand - 7-18 thousand children under the age of 113 years [2]
Access to vocational education for people with disabilities is especially highlighted by the most developed countries of the world, especially through distance learning technology
In Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, 70% of citizens with disabilities received professional and vital skills through computer technology
Projects to train people with disabilities using additional computer technologies are of great importance
Distance learning is a traditional universal form of training in various technical means and new information telecommunications technologies
At the same time, make sure that the specifics of such training do not depend on the location space and flexibility of the time of this student [3]
Consider the most effective and optimal ways to educate people with disabilities using computer technology
Firstly, increasing the accessibility of education of citizens with a defect in the musculoskeletal system, as it is an effective remote communication with the computer and its implementation of external and face-to-face forms of education
Also, the technology of distance learning will be developed in the electronic format of the training course and supplemented with interactive and multimedia materials with an expanded explanation of the teacher
Flash presentation of audio video animation - all this is easy and visible to master the course
Secondly, the presence of teachers of the highest category working with citizens with disabilities (in some cases, citizens with disabilities themselves, who have undergone special training)
Third, training for small groups composed of 5 to 20 persons
Fourth, training of professionals with highly qualified knowledge and skills in the labour market necessary for society
Example: accountancy design management proficiency in foreign languages
Administrator in non-profit translation organizations - graduates with disabilities
acquires a great opportunity to master the specialized skills necessary for an independent life
The education system should not only equip the student with knowledge, but also teach continuous self-education
As a result, education should provide various educational services
The formation of the development of the education system, according to leading domestic specialists in the field of education, includes:
improving the quality of education using new information technologies;
Full education based on post-industrial civilization;
Ensuring the accessibility of remote and self-training using information and telecommunications technologies;
in education, a number of main areas can be attributed, such as increasing creative initiatives
Modern socio-economic conditions provide for quality and affordable education before the education system
Studying the education market, one social group includes people with disabilities who need an unconventional education system [4]
The development of networking technologies will also create an effective path for economically active living for people with disabilities
As you know, at present, production activities are conquering virtual space
As international experience shows, the spatial environment of an employer or employer and its remoteness do not play a particularly important role
No one is surprised if a specialist in India runs a Swiss bank or works with international companies from around the world
In the age of the Internet, the opportunity to achieve great success through the network is growing
In these conditions, people with disabilities have the opportunity to use their cognitive potential in a special full scope
Without mastering new innovative pedagogical technologies of education in the modern sphere of education, it is impossible to become a competent comprehensively knowledgeable specialist
The development of new pedagogical technologies will favorably affect the formation of the teacher's spiritual and moral image of spirituality and many other pedagogical qualities, contributes to the systematic organization of the educational process with self-development
The interesting conduct of any classes is due to the fact that the teacher updates the training methodology using rational methods of constant search
At the same time, the issue of the formation of information culture and such abilities as the information competence of future pedagogical specialists in the conditions of informatization of education becomes an urgent issue today.
The question now arises as to how this issue is being addressed
Especially in the state language, where issues in this direction are still not at a sufficient level [4]
The main task of teachers is to develop the talent of human abilities, forming mental abilities in the conditions of an increasing flow of fast-growing information data of science and technology
He will come with extraordinary demand and creative fruits of a teacher in today's educational space.
Therefore, depending on the abilities of each student, a big turn should be made to master the updated innovative pedagogical technology, which educates education for independence and creativity
In general, computer technology cannot completely replace teachers in the educational process
But for students with disabilities to access education in various situations using computer technologies (through distance learning technologies), the effectiveness of additional education is high, determined by the above lines

The proposed article is based on the current problems of developing the information competence of students in the information society
Existing approaches to the phenomenon under study were considered, in connection with which the authors of the article set out the definition of the basic concept of the concept
The concept is based on a virtual educational space that complements school education
For the organization of a virtual educational space as conditions and means for the development of personality, systematics and competence are favorably revealed
Information competence of virtual educational space Virtual academy of schoolchildren provides convenience of system-interacting competencies
Introduction
The education system updates the problem of developing the information competence of students, taking into account the need to prepare the younger generation for life assigned to superinformation
Information and Methods
Several factors impede the solution of this problem, that is, an ambiguous interpretation of the concept of information competence, for example:
Ability to independently analyze and sort the necessary information, change it in an organized manner and disseminate it using information technologies and specific objects [1] [2];
new literacy includes the adoption of innovative decisions using technological means in conditions where a person can actively process information on his own [3];
the ability of an individual to independently conduct a sample analysis and provide information [4];
integrative properties of the personality - experience of systematic training and use of skills by the subject of knowledge in the field of information and information and communication technologies and also ability to develop and improve the knowledge and to make new decisions with application of new technological means during a transition period or in unexpected situations [5] [6];
- possibility of independent application of new information technologies in combination with individual-mental state of theoretical knowledge about sources of information and ability to work with information presented in various forms [7];
complex individual psychological training in the field of innovative technologies and based on integration of theoretical knowledge and practical skills with a certain set of personal qualities [8] [9];
Professional important qualities, consisting in the acquisition of basic information skills [10] [11];
a combination of personal qualities of the subject allowing to achieve a high result in the activity in the context of a sharp change in the information infrastructure of the institution with a global direction for the development of human information action [12]
With the expansion of the content and scope of the concept of information competence shows the operational influence of the apparatus of pedagogical science on the ability to subject skills from the properties (properties) of an individual to his state of education (organization) of the personality structure, from subject activity to profession - on the complicated requirements of the information society
The contradiction in this is that the current approach to developing the information competence of students responds to the rapid change in the information society, reduces the results of training to the ability to work with information
The necessary information and technological competence of a Kazakh school graduate, which defines the required competence, is guided by "the ability to independently sort search analysis and process it by itself and be able to copy information and knowledge using specific technical forms and information technologies" [13 b
Also in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2012-2016.
Adopted National Work Plan for the Development of Functional Literacy of Schoolchildren [14]
actualizes the application of the ability to create measures in applied and creative conditions
Therefore, in the development of functional literacy of students, the definition of key concepts is the methodological basis of our proposed concept.
Information competence is the integrative properties of a person that reflect the results of the processes of transformation and selection of information ownership for a special type of subject-self-education, which allows you to form an experience in information and communication actions; systematic actualization of this experience in the educational process motivates the readiness and stability of students to transform information into knowledge in order to self-realize self-education in the modern information society as a person
Results of the study
The results of the study prove that the virtual educational space can be considered as an environment for expanding the opportunities for developing the information competence of students
According to our definition, this is a pedagogical reality, reflecting the interconnection of the means of information and communication technologies, in the educational process conditions have been created for the effective organization of the information competencies of students, providing effective education through interactive interaction of all participants, as well as the possibility of their independent and independent implementation
The main component of virtual education is the information fund
To date, it is multilateral (CD books electronic editions multimedia, etc.
In this regard, the educational potential of virtual space has expanded
That is, we can talk about the cognitive activity of this space, which will help to transform information into individual education and in the future into the personal experience of students
Of particular note is the need to use pedagogical information technologies in the development of student information competence in virtual education, where the informatization of the educational process integrates the game, as well as creates a model for the use of new information technologies in further work
The ability to use new information technologies in pedagogical activities is not only social value, but also intellectual value, important for a person who has a great motivational integration value
Figure 1 shows the structure of the virtual educational space focused on the Virtual Academy of schoolchildren (M
North Kazakhstan State University named after Kozybayev)
A significantly targeted set includes a set of educational values and goals that are important in achieving learning and learning goals
The software and methodology package contains all the necessary information on the types of development of information competencies and program strategies
The information package defines the skills of students that form the basis of information activities
The contact group includes types of interaction between participants in the pedagogical process
Technology introduced training tools used in virtual space (information and communication technologies, including local and global)
Each group of virtual space is a small environment in which students carry out activities of a certain type
For example, schoolchildren plan their own work when interacting with information groups
selects an individual training direction
Students, when interacting with software and methodological and technological groupings, can independently deepen their knowledge and skills
Students can use electronic teaching materials to develop competencies, access to electronic catalogs of libraries and electronic textbooks
Figure 1
Virtual Education Space Structure
Virtual education for the development of information competencies can be considered as a complex and multifaceted process with its own thematic and methodological approaches
According to Yakovleva's fair comment, each approach is considered insufficient only when studying a successful and accurate event in understanding the investigated aspect, since "an objective view can be obtained only with a comprehensive study using a set of approaches" [15 s
We offer a combination of system-service and competent approaches
The system-service approach prescribes to investigate the object so that the nature of the meaningful characteristics of the pedagogical system is effective
As the content of the process of developing the information competence of students in the context of virtual education, specially organized activities can be considered
The study trend is a continuous exchange of various actions aimed at achieving a high level of information competence
It is determined as a result of implementation of system-service approach in conditions of virtual educational space:
The system-service approach is considered as a theoretical and methodological basis that helps to determine the following groups of elements: goals, types of tasks, methods - in the process of virtual education and interaction of the structure of this process with external objects (environment), which provides a comprehensive mastery of the investigated problem
The development of student information competence is an internal system of virtual education, which allows it to be implemented in accordance with general didactic principles
A system-service approach will help to effectively organize the pedagogical management of the development of student information competence
The system-service approach determines the nature of the activity of the teacher and student in the virtual space, which creates conditions for the manifestation of personal qualities
The development of the studied sanctuary is a continuous exchange of various types of actions aimed at achieving a sufficient level of information competence
A set of modern knowledge about the learning mechanism in the implementation of virtual education should have a flexible competence, based on the goals and motives of students
Provides a description of the content and structure of information competence, reflecting a set of qualities and features achieved in the educational process by a suitable individual
The main goal of virtual education in accordance with competence is to bring students to a high level of information competence by coordinating self-education and the activity of pedagogical management in a short period of time
The effective development of information competence of students of the Virtual Academy of schoolchildren is ensured by the following conditions:
development of motivational preparation of students for realization of virtual educational subtleties;
implementation of virtual educational opportunities based on system-service and competent approaches;
Routing examples of educational model methods to implement virtual educational opportunities
providing reflexive management of the process of implementing virtual educational opportunities in the development of information competencies
Conclusion
We link the solution to the problem of developing the information competence of students with virtual education, complementing traditional school education
Virtual educational space is considered not only as a means for the development of personality
It is used as a specific social community that develops a set of relationships between people in the context of a person's socio-cultural adaptation to jihan
Virtual space will be formed by a pedagogical team with state support for environmental factors
The didactic potential of virtual education in the development of student information competence lies in an educational paradigm aimed at the individual; interactivity; a high level of educational motivation; individual way and trajectory of training with priority of effective type of training; aimed at developing creative skills and search activity; against the background of positive emotions; defined by continuous self-education and independent work

The k means algorithm is the most common of clustering methods
Algorithm has more power due to simplicity and high execution speed
Works on calculation of parallel processing of hyperspectral image are performed
The program set provides clustering of each object using the MPJ Express library in the Java software environment and the k means algorithm in Hadoop technology
Program with Parallel Clustering Efficiency Distribution
Satellite images taken on different spectral scales contain very useful information and are stored in quantitative form
The use of space imagery in the online updating of mid- and small-scale maps is becoming cost-effective
Color images created on the basis of remote sensing of three spectral channels carry more information than in geodetic or aerial photographs, and stereotyped images allow for three-dimensional analysis of spatial objects [12]
Currently, hyperspectral patterns have a lot of algorithms for implementing object recognition
One of the leading algorithms among them is the k means clustering algorithm
Modeling mathematical and quantitative methods of the data clustering algorithm when separating objects in hyperspectral figures
k means clustering algorithm with Java sequence
The algorithm is iterative, and a given set of points (pixels) is clustered into cluster points close to the centers as a result of changing the location of these centers

Secondly, between the algorithm -
defines points related to the cluster iteratively to each object, calculating the distance
The process is repeated to the end value specified by [3]
Solution of parallel clustering algorithm using the Java MPJ Express library
The clustering algorithm k means works with large bulk data reserves, that is, with 100 percent points and dozens of gigabytes of data, and therefore parallelization in calculating the algorithm is very effective
Parallel clustering algorithm:
Input: Number of clusters K number of data objects Output: K centroid

3, Data in one form between processors per object N

12, At the end of each iteration, a new center is calculated depending on the result of clustering;
13: Extreme clustering defines the value of Centroid; 14: MPI _ Finalize//end of procedure;
Solution of k means clustering algorithm based on MapReduce
MapReduce provides this software model and useful parallelism
Programs recorded in the software model are automatically paraffined in the distribution program [4]
Currently, distribution processing of images at a very small time becomes a relevant topic.
And the use of distribution computing in MapReduce technology - Hadoop is one of the main topics in the modern scientific and technical world
The main advantage of Hadoop technology is that it automatically allocates any large amounts of data transferred to several computers in distribution computing and saves time using two steps Map and Reduce, along with large-scale.
Difficulty solving the result of computing any large scale data on a single computer
This scientific problem began to be solved after the advent of Hadoop technology
Used when processing the distribution mapping of complex data
The clustering algorithm in Hadoop technology:
Initially, Mapper reads the entered values and compresses the original data into a subcomponent of the data, that is, into an auxiliary cluster
Creates a source cluster k from the secondary cluster for each Mapper Reduce
Reduce includes cluster from each Mapper and recalculates centroids for k cluster
These centrons are sent back to the original Mapper by exchange
Each Mapper reads a new centroid for the secondary cluster Mapper sends the cluster back to Reduce
Reduce restarts cluster and calculates new centroid
This procedure is repeated until Reduce stops sending data to Mapper
This usually ends when the algorithm is equal
Map function:
6:	dist	=	cal_dist_labpixel_to_centers(labPixel	Array[j]);	//primary	calculates the cluster centers, that is, the distance between the entered points
8: out _ value = in _ value ;//defines the location of pixel 9: writeToHDFS (out _ keyout _ value);
Reduce function:
+ + counter; }//calculates the new average value until the iterator is empty
The basic idea of a parallel k-means clustering algorithm is displayed in the classification of each point (pixel) based on the MapReduce in the Map function, the calculation of the nearest cluster and the center of new clusters is performed in the entire Reduce function
So, a serial and parallel version of the clustering algorithm k means was created using MPI technology in the Java programming language
In addition, the distribution algorithm is implemented in technology MapReduce
Table 1 - Processing time depending on value of input point of linear and parallel clustering algorithm
Figure 1 - Comparison of the processing time interval of the serial and parallel clustering algorithm
Figure 2 - Processing time difference of serial and parallel clustering algorithm
Table 2 - time interval in Java software environment using MPJ Express library and Hadoop technology depending on value of entered k means algorithm point
Figure 3 - Comparison of processing time interval of serial parallel and distributed clustering algorithm
Finally, the use of the MapReduce paradigm significantly reduced the time of the algorithm in image processing
In our practices, calculations are calculated using the MapReduce paradigm on the Hadoop platform for distribution computing
The use of the Hadoop platform allowed us to change the scale of the calculation of the report, providing calculation in several computing nodes
Specific calculations from created practices can achieve a linear acceleration of the calculation speed by increasing the number of nodes
With the help of conventional computers, we see that on the Hadoop platform, large amounts of data are efficient

The article will consider the course of informatics in medical universities
Three levels of training in informatics in medical universities are described
The article reflects the peculiarities of training in informatics in medical universities
Medical universities will consider the target tasks of teaching general education courses in informatics
Goals and objectives of training in information technologies in medicine and healthcare will also be announced
Keywords: informatics, level of teaching of informatics in medical universities, medicine and information technologies in the field of health, medical informatics
Currently, computerized cardiology, using coding methods for high-quality medical equipment, including digital information, digital X-ray technology, etc.
The increase in funds puts high requirements on the level of information culture of the future medical specialist
As you know, all this is related to computer technology
Therefore, it is impossible to imagine the future of a doctor who has not developed knowledge management skills in general education informatics
In this regard, training in informatics in medical universities is currently becoming one of the current problems
Training in informatics at a medical university, in our opinion, should be associated with three types of training
The first basic - the "standard" level of training in informatics - will be studied at higher educational institutions to fulfill the curriculum when studying in a selected specialty
As well as knowledge in informatics, corresponding to a working program prepared on the basis of a standard program of discipline in the preparation of specialties "medical care" and "pediatrics"
The second level of specialist training is intended for a specialist with higher medical education, as well as a specialized specialist in the field of special practical health care
The content of this level consists in the mastery of information technologies used at a particular doctor's workplace (provider - average medical worker)
This subject can be taught in internship
Levels of training in informatics in medical universities
Base Level
Profile level
Professional level
Knowledge management skills in general informatics, as well as the use of a competent computer aimed at active issues of medical informatics
Knowledge of medical informatics in professional activities (specialist doctor with computer technology, head of health care provider average medical worker)
Availability of specialized knowledge and skills in medical informatics
Programmer in applied medicine
Local Area Network Administrator and Automated Control System (Computer Doctor) of Application Programmer
Basic training in general informatics and medical informatics will be provided in accordance with the curriculum
The specialties "Pharmacy" and "Nursing" provide for the improvement of knowledge in general and medical informatics in accordance with individual training or advanced training
The third level is intended for a deeper mastery of discipline and the introduction of information technologies in the medical and diagnostic process and the management of higher-level specialists to increase scientific activity in the field of "special" informatics
Such information education requires individual training of a student in basic informatics in universities or universities or as part of a residency in the specialty "Medical informatics and an automated control system"
A deeper study of general medical informatics of the content of training, as well as the development of modern equipment (programming languages ​ ​ of Internet technology and artificial intelligence tools) is the creation of a software product in the medical sphere
Approves knowledge and skills in the subject of training in informatics in medical universities
In our opinion, training in informatics in medical universities will contribute to the uninterrupted provision of the needs of practical healthcare and pharmacy, which should be organized in stages
Training in informatics in secondary and higher medical schools has its peculiarities [1]
On the one hand, school physicians and students use public applications (spreadsheet text editor data fund management systems, browsers, mail programs, translation programs, etc.
) on the other hand, in training, special programs are needed that carry out the activities of a doctor - a fund of pharmaceutical data of medical information systems, etc.
to combine the tasks of teaching general and special specialized informatics between secondary and higher educational institutions, there should be continuity between the faculties of postgraduate institutions for advanced training of doctors
Now in the CIS countries we will focus on the timing of training in informatics at medical universities
For example, since 2000, the experience of training in informatics and medical informatics in the field of training future doctors in the field of medicine and health has been accumulated.
In particular, when training in informatics in medical colleges, general issues of medical organization - management of clinical informatics and laboratory informatics of information technologies will be studied and issues of structuring and operation of medical information systems will be considered
In medical universities, students study and carry out practical skills in general informatics in computer classes
At higher courses of medical universities, students will study medical informatics
In contrast to them, popular and accessible training programs in general informatics are used, and special software is used in medical informatics, widely used in medical and preventive institutions
Some medical universities use specially prepared medical information software to teach medical informatics courses [2]
It
as a result of the application of the software, students will be able to independently work with an electronic medical history and an outpatient card, as well as create conditions for assessing the advantage of medical information systems in practical work to study all cycles of information processing and storage
Future specialists prepared in this way have become not only good users, but also conductors implementing automation ideas
in addition, periodically and more deeply trained doctor actively stimulates the process of evolution of the information system and contributes to the improvement of software medical information systems manufacturers
As a tool for improving the technical cycle "Information Technologies in Medicine" at the faculties of advanced training of doctors, doctors expand the idea of ​ ​ special medical programs, increasing the skill of applying applications
At the same time, the database focuses on Internet technologies
Therefore, the training of informatics in medical educational institutions should be carried out in stages, and it is also necessary to use educational versions of special medical programs and use special educational literature of specific methodological approaches
Currently, in the system of training future doctors, medical universities produce textbooks and textbooks on informatics for doctors and use them in the educational process
Workshops on general education informatics are held at primary computer science courses in medical universities
In the most common software products in the lessons of the workshop, students can perform theory and tasks for learning [3-5]
The following software products will be used in the lessons of the workshop: Microsoft Windows XP operating systems vector graphics editor CorelDraw, as well as software products included in the Microsoft Office 2010 package: MS Word text editor of the MS Access data fund management system, MS Excel table processor
The fundamentals of Internet connection and functioning will also be considered
the Medical University of Kazakhstan-Russia Medical University learns the skills of working with various packages of programs depending on the topic of conducting classes in the subject of informatics; obtaining information by automated method is carried out in special laboratories of the course, covered by various instrument-computer systems and normal expert systems of automatic diagnostics, which process and analyze the received information
As you know, in preparation for wide information of future doctors in healthcare, the stage of familiarization of people with general informatics and informatization of medical science with new computer technologies has begun
Therefore, the purpose of training in general educational informatics is to form the ability of students to study other educational subjects and use the computer in their professions, necessary to form them directly as future doctors
Currently, medical forecasting widely applies quantitative indicators in the medical and preventive areas of disease
Depending on this situation
working capacity with computer education in medical education is extremely necessary
When teaching general informatics at medical universities:
formation of logical thinking of students for assimilation of basic concepts of informatization, application of standards and universal means of informatization for solving medical reports;
Use of well-established biomedical data processing programmes:
familiarization of students with the services of a wide territorial network: Internet e-mail information resources;
computer	networks	medical	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	application:	Internet resources consist of remote learning tasks
As a result of training in general computer science, students receive information about the computer; The basis of computer methods for storing and processing information necessary for the professional activity of a specialist; fundamentals of incompatimization and programming; new computer technologies; working with applications; Applications of biomedical data processing and statistical analysis software; The population (the production team of the region is a children's institution) should know the basics of methods for collecting and analyzing information on health
In the health sector, due to the discovery of biopharmacy and other factors in the processing of new devices for the constant improvement of diagnostic tools, we can notice the need for changes in the training of future doctors and specialists
Efficient technologies for health formation are traditionally called information technology in medicine
Currently, there are many types of specialized medical software
When solving all reports, there are specialized systems that correspond to the processing of medical information
The specialized medical system is conditionally divided into two: the medical information system and the means of the medical computer system
Key group of main means of healthcare informatization will be information system
Doctors need to master the subject of classification of information systems
The use of computer and management equipment in medical practice will allow, on a direct time scale, to process and manage its condition, new effective means to provide a new automated information set on the condition of the patient
This process leads to the creation of an instrumental method of intensive care research at a new qualitative level of the medical computer system (GKPC)
Knowledge for the doctor of the rules of software organization of hardware in the development and further development of the State Emergency Committee is necessary
Public health actively participates in the formation of informatization program
Doctors and organizers of practical health care are responsible for assisting in the competent use of new introduced information technologies and informatization
In recent years, the infrastructure of extensive electronic information resources has been established and put into operation in medical institutions
Therefore, the formation of a system of knowledge of qualifications and skills in teaching information and communication technologies of the course "Information Technologies in Medicine and Healthcare" the introduction of a personal computer in daily medical practice, students of medical universities use information and communication technologies in the educational process, as well as the informatization of health students
is an introduction to methods
In medical institutions of higher education
Based on the course "Information Technology in Medicine and Health":
application of modern computer programs in professional events;
application of the Medical Statistics programme in medical biological research;
application of specialized software equipment for decision-making by a doctor;
application by the structural management unit in a preventive medical institution of an automated workplace of an individual specialist;
health information movement management;
Set the task of building the ability to use the Internet and the local network

The article gives important characteristics of educational portals
Education portal Kazakhstan As a result of the analysis of Russian general education portals and educational portals of other countries, the main activity of the training portal with the accumulation of positive experience and certain types of teaching activities will be determined
Information and communication environment of remote learning portals of new information technologies
In general, the concept of a portal is ambiguous
As is known, the portal is a reasonable tool for selecting sources of resource pooling information for providing a network television and radio company with a developed user interface and a wide range of services and links to creating instant messages, through a simple interface to indicating and configuring this direction.
Modern Internet portals are quite large and complex network information technology complexes focused on the provision of reference analytical and other information services
The most important characteristics of educational portals are [1]:
filling for users - the portal consumer's place is assigned to individual users or a community or a portal independent of it should allow you to individually configure the content and additional interfaces of your appearance for each;
organization of the consumer's place of work - the user's place of work, which allows avoiding overload of information, should be the most convenient and organized in a combined form;
allocation of resources - ensuring that the portal can be divided into several levels so that signatures of different categories of users are achieved
For example, only managers can connect to some levels
The portal interface ensures the identity of users, that is, the creation of an interaction map with a single authentication registration on the server and t
of the Republic of Kazakhstan;
work monitoring is a significant characteristic of a particular person to reproduce a portal assigned at the beginning of operation of the portal, and increases as information about its interests accumulates;
displaying information from the database and creating active communication - from many heterogeneous sources (from multidimensional databases with recorded data from document management systems from Web servers and news channels t
) the ability of the portal to ensure the display and communication of information is also considered a fundamental factor;
information isolation and discovery - the search engine used provides subject-related experts with tools and tools that can also actively find and communicate to communities and content
Given the diversity of facilities with computer technology and telecommunications infrastructure, education should provide, among other things, almost equal opportunities for different facilities in the region, regardless of the degree of facilities
In addition, the organization of the work of the pedagogical and administrative staff of educational institutions should be equipped with an understandable interface and not require deep special training to carry out their professional duties through this environment.
During the study, it was found that the organization of forums and the management of joint projects and seminars with the distribution of packages of curricula and programs of the unified training manual make it possible to organize an effective environment for the implementation of testing systems for practical and laboratory classes and technological education systems of others.
Consider the general education portal of Russia, which became the laureate of the 2008 Prize of the Government of Russia in the educational zone [2] (Figure 1)
Photo 1 - The main window of the basic federal educational portal of Russia
This window opens the window, as in Table 1, if you select the general education portal of Russia
Table 1 - List of general education portal of Russia
When you select a portal package from this window, the following list is displayed (Figure 2):

A total of 444 sites will be released
There are also educational portals of the Republic of Kazakhstan (table 2)
Table 2 - Educational portals of the Republic of Kazakhstan
One of these sites is a distance learning system used in the training process at the departments of Moodle universities [3] (Figure 3)
Figure 3 - first page of the portal
This distance learning system will be used for the development programme
Its goal is to study the basics of building educational disciplines in accordance with the Moodle distance learning system and methodical support for the qualitative analysis of professional development and self-education experience
The development programme provides ready-to-use methodologies for the application of achievements in the information and communications technology training process
The content of the program takes into account the current concepts and existing difficulties of e-learning
The program is aimed at scientific and pedagogical workers of higher professional education institutions
Training period 12 number of days 72 hours
Training process ends with final project work
At the end, the students are issued a certificate of advanced training
It was also established that the educational portal is a complex human-machine software-information complex for the placement and use of ready-made information, as well as other information designed to improve the organization of the distributed scientific, methodological and educational process, and their management in various institutions to provide information to various categories of users
The main goal of creating and developing the portal is information and methodological support for the activities of subjects of the educational process
For this, the educational portal should become an effective tool for creating the authority of the educational system as a comprehensive open tool for the accumulation and use of distributed educational resources
Portal of Education As you know, the recruitment of teachers and various categories of students with information and methodological materials is a system that performs the task of integrating the experience of innovative work in educational institutions
The main objective of the educational portal, designed for the remote interaction of subjects of the educational process, is to provide the needs in the educational process with meeting all the necessary conditions on the basis of optimal use of available distributed information resources of the scientific and pedagogical direction
In this regard, the basic services of the training portal are provided, which are presented in Figure 4
Figure 4 - Basic services of the educational portal
From here, the portal shows that the complex human-machine software-information complex of education is a special infrastructure of automation and improvement of the education management system, which requires a set of conditions for preparation and effective operation of the portal to improve the quality of information-methodological and technological staffing of the educational process
As a compiler of the education system, the portal can ensure the collection and preparation of a set of high-quality educational and teaching materials and free interaction with them through effective mechanisms for searching the Internet resources of its own and external education
Information and communication technology is a set of ways of transmitting information provided by users in any form using modern means of communication, providing information interaction both at the local level (for example, within one or more organizations) and within the framework of the global Internet information network (symbolic text graphic audio-video information)
The information and communication environment of the Portal consists of means and technologies of transfer (dissemination) and selection of media recovery tools with knowledge of information from numerous information forms and links between them, as well as organizational structures supporting information interaction with information processes [4]
Changes and improves the activities of society, including with the creation of an information and communication environment
Building an information and communication environment requires the use of client-server technologies
The information required to run the system is stored on the server computer and accessed through the client application (s)
The implementation of this technology requires the creation of a structural model necessary for the portal of three sections, in which the client-user database server (client level) is also a data logic information protection system, a middle-tier application server
On-demand application server queries the Data Foundation server, which optimizes customer preparation and related service
Applications allocated to individual fragments reduce the load on both the client machine and the Data Fund server by transporting the corresponding methods to a special application server
Educational Portal Russia All-Russian general education portal All-Russian Internet Pedagogical Council Internet-state teachers Network of creative teachers Sector schools European school sector As a result of the analysis of the work of domestic and foreign educational communities, such as the educational portal of Great Britain Germany Sweden Canada and other countries, gained positive experience
The following individual types of teaching activities are defined:
remote counselling;
remote training;
remote Olympiad;
visits to forums;
discussion of lesson plans;
exchange of experience in the implementation of network projects;
work of moderators, leading headings, etc.
It was established that the educational portal should take into account that providing information and methodological materials for teachers and students of various categories is a system that performs a mission to integrate the experience of innovative work in educational institutions
It was also established that in the process of teaching teachers are new information technologies for organizing interaction with distance students and ensuring conditions for meeting the needs of students based on the effective use of the allocated information resources of the current scientific and pedagogical purpose

This article describes paper and electronic document flow
Due to the low efficiency of the traditional document flow, the need to use the software system - electronic document flow (ESEDO)
Leading states involved in the creation and development of the current "e-government": USA South Korea Great Britain France Australian practice will be analyzed in such a way that the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan can be more favorable
Keywords: electronic document electronic document management system of the electronic government
Today, many urgent issues arise in connection with the dynamic development of information technologies in the work on document management.
sitting
In this regard, in this article we describe paper and electronic document flow
Paper paperwork has the following drawbacks:
time spent searching for documents;
It is difficult to control the movement of a document at all stages of its life cycle;
Long lead time for preparing documents and linking them;
Workflow management is difficult if multiple users work with a single document
Limited or complex availability of reports and journals
Thus, the efficiency of traditional workflow is low
All these shortcomings will be addressed in the implementation of the electronic document management system
One way to solve the problem is the use of special software - electronic document management system (ESEDO)
Tasks and list of UEFA functions:
Registration of incoming correspondence
Recording of outgoing correspondence
registration of internal organizational and management documents of the organization;
registration of letters and appeals of citizens;
Creation of draft electronic documents [1];
Head of State announced the idea of creating e-government in the country in his annual Address to the people of Kazakhstan on the inclusion of the republic among fifty competitive countries of the world
On November 10, 2004, the Presidential Decree approved the State Program for the Formation of Electronic Government in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2005-2007 "On Electronic Government"
E-Workflow Performance Availability of a user-friendly interface
This is achieved using the principles of describing objects and their actions
Information is entered on the computer via the screen form from the input document
Its components correspond to the screen form associated with the metaphor for these documents and the metaphor for users (Figure 1)
Figure 1 - Conversion of incoming documentation into electronic form
The following requirements shall be met by the algorithms enabling the design of the ESEDO:
Ability to disable incremental editing and work with different data types and sizes
Ability to work with other information systems performed by transmission to the UES
The possibility of merging the internal application processes of each information system by creating typical business processes in the USEDO
Ability to manage documents (the ability to link to documents with the introduction of a history of working with documents, editing of which disables documents, the ability to link to documents located in internal information systems of document version control, providing access to data for automating the filling of parts of metamalimets)
Routing Capability (Automatic Scheduling)
Information Storage and Transmission Security (Restriction of Access Rights to USEDO Authentication Objects
Information processing The introduction of computer technologies for transportation storage led to the creation of documents on new media
He in turn
the emergence of the concepts of "electronic document" or "document in electronic version"
Use of information technologies in public administration increased in several countries of the world, including Kazakhstan
In accordance with it, the requirements and approaches to the work of government agencies have changed
Traditional actions begin differently
In a number of Asian countries in Singapore, Malaysia and the United States of America have developed the concept of e-government at the state level in Germany
Kazakhstan successfully implemented the state program of formation of "e-government" in 2005-2007.
This project also provides for the integration of state information funds with the introduction of electronic administrative regulations
Electronic document management in many States
Direct link to the e-government project
Now
Many countries around the world are engaged in the creation and development of e-government
USA South Korea Great Britain France Australia
Such an analysis has been carried out that their experience may be inclined to the situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Foreign experience in solving the problems of the "e-government" project consists of a well-known set of conceptual directions
Experience managing electronic documents in Germany, one of the leading European countries
The concept of implementing electronic records management in German federal government structures in three stages: at the first stage, only reference data of documents are recorded in the system; in a second step, the contents of the primary information of the scanned documents are attached to the registration data; in the third phase, all documents and cases are processed electronically and processes are in progress [3]
Therefore, in the automation of the management of electronic documents, not only technological issues, but also human resources issues and other closely related issues must be comprehensively resolved.

The basis of DOMEA "Data Protection" "Archiving" consists of several applications of type "Scanning" and additional modules of extensions
"Organizer Concept" [4]
With regard to the experience of the United States of America, the National Archives and Electronic Records Administration (NARA) plays a special role in the regulatory framework for the management of electronic documents.
Electronic document management is one of NARA's activities	is
So, the collection of materials related to the presidential rule of William Jefferson Clinton contains not only paper documents, but also archival data of the official website of the White House
About four billion records implemented in the electronic document fund of the National Archive
In accordance with the Act on Electronic Signature in International and State Trade Relations adopted by Congress on January 24, 2000, the following certificate was issued to the electronic document:

A Framework for Information Management in Canadian Government Institutions has been adopted to implement common information fund management practices
It is aimed exclusively at ensuring the protection of state information
It does not say anything about information constituting commercial or bank personal secrecy
The Concept provides comprehensive explanations on the necessary issues of management of state information and state information funds
The document contains the following thematic chapters:
access to public information;
accessibility of information and communication technologies;

The Framework for Public Information Management includes a strategic section with defined basic objectives and principles and an internship methodology with trained instructions and standards
Speaking about Australia's experience in this area, the National Archives signed the Archives Act (1983).
) performs a managerial function in the management of documents in the relevant government institutions, issues regulatory documents in the field of archival affairs
In 1996, Australia adopted for the first time in the world the National Electronic Document Management Standard, which contains instructions for working with traditional paper documents and new electronic documents
Unlike other countries, Australia has more rational aspects of its experience
The Australian Archive is the responsibility of the Australian Archive
It was established in 1983 under the Archives Act and has been called the National Archives of Australia since 1998.
The Law on Archives allows citizens to access state documents 30 years from the date of drawing up documents, that is, in accordance with the Law on Freedom of Information Act 1982 - the issue of freedom of use of documents by state bodies has been resolved
In accordance with the confidentiality of information related to personal life in certain cases (Privacy Act 1988) - ensures the legality of the use of personal documents in the activities of state bodies, as well as the acquaintance of citizens with them
The National Archives, in a senior position in the management of government records in the Australian Union, began producing important regulatory projects from the management of electronic documents and archival affairs previously two other leaders - the US National Archives and the National Bank of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
So, already in 1995, the Australian Archive published books such as "Electronic Document Management," and in 1997, "Electronic Mail Management as a Document" [5]
According to the Australian concept of "electronic document management" (Records management) is a subject aimed at meeting the important needs of the business of the state and society, and the organizational function of electronic document management
Work with electronic documents is distributed as follows:
document continuum management (Records Continuum) - a graphical and theoretical model that includes vertical and interconnected work with documents from the moment these documents appear (previously - when creating a system for designing the work of an electronic document) to storage and use as an archive
Rules for the creation and storage of an electronic document in the industry known as the recording region, that is, from the design of the electronic document handling system to the termination of the existence of the document;
Ensuring the provision of management services and the use of documents to meet the needs and protect the interests of institutions and their staff;
the creation of fully reliable and capable documents providing information from the activities of institutions;
managing documents as valuable property and information;
implementation of a rational organization in the management of documents for improving quality, as well as the activities of the general institution by correctly establishing practical work on working with documents
The value of the Australian electronic document management model is defined in the acronym CADSS, which includes five main functions for effective document management

of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Support means e-workflow management [5]
In the UK, the official document "Modernization of Public Administration" is the basic element in the management of electronic records (documents)
The Government intends to transfer all central government agencies for 2004 to electronic storage and indexing of its information funds to meet e-work requirements
In 2002, the UK State Archives developed functional requirements for electronic document management systems
UK firms that set up an electronic document management system are being tested in the National Archives, interested in evaluating their software in accordance with these requirements
Testing of such software products is also available in US practice [6]
In conclusion, a comparative analysis of the automation of the management of electronic documents abroad shows that the work on electronic documents carried out in the country is aimed at meeting the final needs of the state in society and business and individuals.
It became known that the combination of traditional signatures and electronic digital signatures with paper documents and electronic documents in electronic document management in state bodies of the country is similar to foreign experience
At the same time, systematic study of foreign experience in the management of electronic documents in the future showed the need to effectively use its results in organizations of Kazakhstan
Dynamic development of Kazakhstan as a permanent member of the world association manifests itself in the introduction of new innovative projects into a single documented information space of organizations
And the application of international standards for the management of electronic documents has a successful place in the management system of quality management of domestic organizations and manufacturers

This article pays special attention worldwide to the issues of creating an inclusive society and fully integrating citizens with disabilities into the public environment and finding ways to solve these problems
The main problem of discussion is the improvement of the level of education and the ability of such categories of people to work
The issue under consideration is broad in scope
According to the UN, the number of people with physical and mental disorders is more than 450 million people around the world
Of these, more than 200 million children with disabilities
Access to vocational education for people with disabilities is especially highlighted by the most developed countries of the world, especially through distance learning technology
Higher education an inclusive society of information and communication technologies
Currently, the issue of full integration of citizens with disabilities into the public environment is being considered with special activity in the world and are looking for ways to solve these problems
First of all, the subject of discussion is the creation of conditions for the full integration and education of such categories of people into labor activities.
dated 17 January 2014 N
From Nazarbayev's Address to the People of Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan Way - 2050: A Single Goal - A Single Future"
Fifth, our citizens with disabilities should pay more attention to
For them, Kazakhstan should become a barrier-free zone
We should have less concern for such people - it is our duty to ourselves and society
This is what the whole world does
People with disabilities will be able to work at agricultural enterprises of the food industry and consumer services
I instruct all entrepreneurs to employ them
I want to say again: help
It is also possible to consider the possibility of introducing a special quota for 5-10 people
We involve them in active life, they not only receive benefits, but will also feel useful workers in society
To all our social institutes, non-governmental organizations, Nr Otan party it is necessary to get to this work
If necessary, the Government needs to work on this issue together with all companies and make an appropriate decision
I instruct the Government to increase the amount of social benefits for disability and loss of the breadwinner by 25% from July 1, 2015
There is a need to improve the legal framework for associations of persons with disabilities
"special attention should be paid to people with disabilities [1]
So society began to understand and perceive the importance of developing inclusive education of civil servants and international organizations
Inclusive education will allow people with disabilities to receive the same education in general education schools in their place of residence
Issues at the core of the educational policy of our country - improvement and improvement of the quality of professional training, radical renewal of the scientific and methodological system for providing knowledge, changing the types of forms and methods of training, closing the gap between best educational practices and the needs of modern society, differentiating innovation in education, enhancing its role in ensuring continuity in the process of improving knowledge and the ability to apply modern technology and technologies at a high level
Despite the fact that the law "On Education" states that all children have a general secondary education, unfortunately, the issue of teaching people with disabilities remains relevant
One of the achievements of science in education and education of people with disabilities is the mastery of new technologies and the use of a computer
When using a computer, you can take into account the didactic capabilities of cognitive processes; the formation of a logical system of thinking, the creation of conditions for creative work of mental activity and interest in education
Because vision is, of course, a special impression.
Given that every citizen of our state is every child of national value - this is the future of our country, we must create conditions for the formation of every person with disabilities with a high-quality education.
Although one person with disabilities should understand that improving the quality of education is a fund that is now accumulating in the conscious prospects of the nation
Inclusive education is also an integral part of UNESCO's work "Education for All"
This program was approved by the UN General Assembly and included in the UN Convention on December 13, 2006
The issue of inclusive education begins abroad in 1970, and by the 90s the United States and Europe had fully implemented this program in their educational policy
And the development of the system of inclusive education in our country is an official fact of the development of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan	In the State Program for 2011-2020
Development of inclusive education: modular education programmes for people with disabilities by 2015; Rules for the combined education of persons with disabilities in general education are being developed; By 2020, schools will be equipped with ramps with lifting equipment for the disabled, special desks with handles for installing special devices in sanitary rooms and other compensation tables
barrier-free zones will be created with facilities
The program will also create conditions for equal access to education for children with disabilities
Today, most people with disabilities studying at home are provided with computer equipment
This question is different in scope
Because according to the UN, the number of people with physical and mental disorders around the world
More than 40 million people
Of these, more than 200 million children with disabilities
In the Republic of Kazakhstan 150 thousand children with disabilities - 4 thousand - from 3-6 thousand to 33 thousand - 7-18 thousand children under the age of 113 years [2]
Access to vocational education for people with disabilities is especially highlighted by the most developed countries of the world, especially through distance learning technology
In Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, 70% of citizens with disabilities received professional and vital skills through computer technology
Projects to train people with disabilities using additional computer technologies are of great importance
Distance learning is a traditional universal form of training in various technical means and new information telecommunications technologies
At the same time, make sure that the specifics of such training do not depend on the location space and flexibility of the time of this student [3]
Consider the most effective and optimal ways to educate people with disabilities using computer technology
Firstly, increasing the accessibility of education of citizens with a defect in the musculoskeletal system, as it is an effective remote communication with the computer and its implementation of external and face-to-face forms of education
Also, the technology of distance learning will be developed in the electronic format of the training course and supplemented with interactive and multimedia materials with an expanded explanation of the teacher
Flash presentation of audio video animation - all this is easy and visible to master the course
Secondly, the presence of teachers of the highest category working with citizens with disabilities (in some cases, citizens with disabilities themselves, who have undergone special training)
Third, training for small groups composed of 5 to 20 persons
Fourth, training of professionals with highly qualified knowledge and skills in the labour market necessary for society
Example: accountancy design management proficiency in foreign languages
Administrator in non-profit translation organizations - graduates with disabilities
acquires a great opportunity to master the specialized skills necessary for an independent life
The education system should not only equip the student with knowledge, but also teach continuous self-education
As a result, education should provide various educational services
The formation of the development of the education system, according to leading domestic specialists in the field of education, includes:
improving the quality of education using new information technologies;
Full education based on post-industrial civilization;
Ensuring the accessibility of remote and self-training using information and telecommunications technologies;
in education, a number of main areas can be attributed, such as increasing creative initiatives
Modern socio-economic conditions provide for quality and affordable education before the education system
Studying the education market, one social group includes people with disabilities who need an unconventional education system [4]
The development of networking technologies will also create an effective path for economically active living for people with disabilities
As you know, at present, production activities are conquering virtual space
As international experience shows, the spatial environment of an employer or employer and its remoteness do not play a particularly important role
No one is surprised if a specialist in India runs a Swiss bank or works with international companies from around the world
In the age of the Internet, the opportunity to achieve great success through the network is growing
In these conditions, people with disabilities have the opportunity to use their cognitive potential in a special full scope
Without mastering new innovative pedagogical technologies of education in the modern sphere of education, it is impossible to become a competent comprehensively knowledgeable specialist
The development of new pedagogical technologies will favorably affect the formation of the teacher's spiritual and moral image of spirituality and many other pedagogical qualities, contributes to the systematic organization of the educational process with self-development
The interesting conduct of any classes is due to the fact that the teacher updates the training methodology using rational methods of constant search
At the same time, the issue of the formation of information culture and such abilities as the information competence of future pedagogical specialists in the conditions of informatization of education becomes an urgent issue today.
The question now arises as to how this issue is being addressed
Especially in the state language, where issues in this direction are still not at a sufficient level [4]
The main task of teachers is to develop the talent of human abilities, forming mental abilities in the conditions of an increasing flow of fast-growing information data of science and technology
He will come with extraordinary demand and creative fruits of a teacher in today's educational space.
Therefore, depending on the abilities of each student, a big turn should be made to master the updated innovative pedagogical technology, which educates education for independence and creativity
In general, computer technology cannot completely replace teachers in the educational process
But for students with disabilities to access education in various situations using computer technologies (through distance learning technologies), the effectiveness of additional education is high, determined by the above lines

The proposed article is based on the current problems of developing the information competence of students in the information society
Existing approaches to the phenomenon under study were considered, in connection with which the authors of the article set out the definition of the basic concept of the concept
The concept is based on a virtual educational space that complements school education
For the organization of a virtual educational space as conditions and means for the development of personality, systematics and competence are favorably revealed
Information competence of virtual educational space Virtual academy of schoolchildren provides convenience of system-interacting competencies
Introduction
The education system updates the problem of developing the information competence of students, taking into account the need to prepare the younger generation for life assigned to superinformation
Information and Methods
Several factors impede the solution of this problem, that is, an ambiguous interpretation of the concept of information competence, for example:
Ability to independently analyze and sort the necessary information, change it in an organized manner and disseminate it using information technologies and specific objects [1] [2];
new literacy includes the adoption of innovative decisions using technological means in conditions where a person can actively process information on his own [3];
the ability of an individual to independently conduct a sample analysis and provide information [4];
integrative properties of the personality - experience of systematic training and use of skills by the subject of knowledge in the field of information and information and communication technologies and also ability to develop and improve the knowledge and to make new decisions with application of new technological means during a transition period or in unexpected situations [5] [6];
- possibility of independent application of new information technologies in combination with individual-mental state of theoretical knowledge about sources of information and ability to work with information presented in various forms [7];
complex individual psychological training in the field of innovative technologies and based on integration of theoretical knowledge and practical skills with a certain set of personal qualities [8] [9];
Professional important qualities, consisting in the acquisition of basic information skills [10] [11];
a combination of personal qualities of the subject allowing to achieve a high result in the activity in the context of a sharp change in the information infrastructure of the institution with a global direction for the development of human information action [12]
With the expansion of the content and scope of the concept of information competence shows the operational influence of the apparatus of pedagogical science on the ability to subject skills from the properties (properties) of an individual to his state of education (organization) of the personality structure, from subject activity to profession - on the complicated requirements of the information society
The contradiction in this is that the current approach to developing the information competence of students responds to the rapid change in the information society, reduces the results of training to the ability to work with information
The necessary information and technological competence of a Kazakh school graduate, which defines the required competence, is guided by "the ability to independently sort search analysis and process it by itself and be able to copy information and knowledge using specific technical forms and information technologies" [13 b
Also in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2012-2016.
Adopted National Work Plan for the Development of Functional Literacy of Schoolchildren [14]
actualizes the application of the ability to create measures in applied and creative conditions
Therefore, in the development of functional literacy of students, the definition of key concepts is the methodological basis of our proposed concept.
Information competence is the integrative properties of a person that reflect the results of the processes of transformation and selection of information ownership for a special type of subject-self-education, which allows you to form an experience in information and communication actions; systematic actualization of this experience in the educational process motivates the readiness and stability of students to transform information into knowledge in order to self-realize self-education in the modern information society as a person
Results of the study
The results of the study prove that the virtual educational space can be considered as an environment for expanding the opportunities for developing the information competence of students
According to our definition, this is a pedagogical reality, reflecting the interconnection of the means of information and communication technologies, in the educational process conditions have been created for the effective organization of the information competencies of students, providing effective education through interactive interaction of all participants, as well as the possibility of their independent and independent implementation
The main component of virtual education is the information fund
To date, it is multilateral (CD books electronic editions multimedia, etc.
In this regard, the educational potential of virtual space has expanded
That is, we can talk about the cognitive activity of this space, which will help to transform information into individual education and in the future into the personal experience of students
Of particular note is the need to use pedagogical information technologies in the development of student information competence in virtual education, where the informatization of the educational process integrates the game, as well as creates a model for the use of new information technologies in further work
The ability to use new information technologies in pedagogical activities is not only social value, but also intellectual value, important for a person who has a great motivational integration value
Figure 1 shows the structure of the virtual educational space focused on the Virtual Academy of schoolchildren (M
North Kazakhstan State University named after Kozybayev)
A significantly targeted set includes a set of educational values and goals that are important in achieving learning and learning goals
The software and methodology package contains all the necessary information on the types of development of information competencies and program strategies
The information package defines the skills of students that form the basis of information activities
The contact group includes types of interaction between participants in the pedagogical process
Technology introduced training tools used in virtual space (information and communication technologies, including local and global)
Each group of virtual space is a small environment in which students carry out activities of a certain type
For example, schoolchildren plan their own work when interacting with information groups
selects an individual training direction
Students, when interacting with software and methodological and technological groupings, can independently deepen their knowledge and skills
Students can use electronic teaching materials to develop competencies, access to electronic catalogs of libraries and electronic textbooks
Figure 1
Virtual Education Space Structure
Virtual education for the development of information competencies can be considered as a complex and multifaceted process with its own thematic and methodological approaches
According to Yakovleva's fair comment, each approach is considered insufficient only when studying a successful and accurate event in understanding the investigated aspect, since "an objective view can be obtained only with a comprehensive study using a set of approaches" [15 s
We offer a combination of system-service and competent approaches
The system-service approach prescribes to investigate the object so that the nature of the meaningful characteristics of the pedagogical system is effective
As the content of the process of developing the information competence of students in the context of virtual education, specially organized activities can be considered
The study trend is a continuous exchange of various actions aimed at achieving a high level of information competence
It is determined as a result of implementation of system-service approach in conditions of virtual educational space:
The system-service approach is considered as a theoretical and methodological basis that helps to determine the following groups of elements: goals, types of tasks, methods - in the process of virtual education and interaction of the structure of this process with external objects (environment), which provides a comprehensive mastery of the investigated problem
The development of student information competence is an internal system of virtual education, which allows it to be implemented in accordance with general didactic principles
A system-service approach will help to effectively organize the pedagogical management of the development of student information competence
The system-service approach determines the nature of the activity of the teacher and student in the virtual space, which creates conditions for the manifestation of personal qualities
The development of the studied sanctuary is a continuous exchange of various types of actions aimed at achieving a sufficient level of information competence
A set of modern knowledge about the learning mechanism in the implementation of virtual education should have a flexible competence, based on the goals and motives of students
Provides a description of the content and structure of information competence, reflecting a set of qualities and features achieved in the educational process by a suitable individual
The main goal of virtual education in accordance with competence is to bring students to a high level of information competence by coordinating self-education and the activity of pedagogical management in a short period of time
The effective development of information competence of students of the Virtual Academy of schoolchildren is ensured by the following conditions:
development of motivational preparation of students for realization of virtual educational subtleties;
implementation of virtual educational opportunities based on system-service and competent approaches;
Routing examples of educational model methods to implement virtual educational opportunities
providing reflexive management of the process of implementing virtual educational opportunities in the development of information competencies
Conclusion
We link the solution to the problem of developing the information competence of students with virtual education, complementing traditional school education
Virtual educational space is considered not only as a means for the development of personality
It is used as a specific social community that develops a set of relationships between people in the context of a person's socio-cultural adaptation to jihan
Virtual space will be formed by a pedagogical team with state support for environmental factors
The didactic potential of virtual education in the development of student information competence lies in an educational paradigm aimed at the individual; interactivity; a high level of educational motivation; individual way and trajectory of training with priority of effective type of training; aimed at developing creative skills and search activity; against the background of positive emotions; defined by continuous self-education and independent work

The k means algorithm is the most common of clustering methods
Algorithm has more power due to simplicity and high execution speed
Works on calculation of parallel processing of hyperspectral image are performed
The program set provides clustering of each object using the MPJ Express library in the Java software environment and the k means algorithm in Hadoop technology
Program with Parallel Clustering Efficiency Distribution
Satellite images taken on different spectral scales contain very useful information and are stored in quantitative form
The use of space imagery in the online updating of mid- and small-scale maps is becoming cost-effective
Color images created on the basis of remote sensing of three spectral channels carry more information than in geodetic or aerial photographs, and stereotyped images allow for three-dimensional analysis of spatial objects [12]
Currently, hyperspectral patterns have a lot of algorithms for implementing object recognition
One of the leading algorithms among them is the k means clustering algorithm
Modeling mathematical and quantitative methods of the data clustering algorithm when separating objects in hyperspectral figures
k means clustering algorithm with Java sequence
The algorithm is iterative, and a given set of points (pixels) is clustered into cluster points close to the centers as a result of changing the location of these centers
J in k means algorithm

Specifies the number of objects associated with the NC cluster
The number of clusters in our k means algorithm, that is, the parameter entered by the user
Second, displays N objects from the logon file
In the primary case of centroid K
chooses accidentally  defines 1  k  K -tr_nde
Secondly, between the algorithm -
defines points related to the cluster iteratively to each object, calculating the distance
The process is repeated to the end value specified by [3]
Solution of parallel clustering algorithm using the Java MPJ Express library
The clustering algorithm k means works with large bulk data reserves, that is, with 100 percent points and dozens of gigabytes of data, and therefore parallelization in calculating the algorithm is very effective
Parallel clustering algorithm:
Input: Number of clusters K number of data objects Output: K centroid
1, Start of MPI _ Init//procedure; 2, Read an object from a file;
3, Data in one form between processors per object N
selects and, say, each process has an object value N ';
4, Performs 5-11 steps per process;
5, Each object belongs to hn 1  n  to the nearest cluster N ;
from the formula, that is, calculates a new cluster from each cluster;
calculates a value of J from the formula;
8:	Everyone	from cluster	new	cluster	calculates	k
calculates J from the formula;
Step 10: 6-9 is repeated
11, Each object creates a cluster identifier for a value;
12, At the end of each iteration, a new center is calculated depending on the result of clustering;
13: Extreme clustering defines the value of Centroid; 14: MPI _ Finalize//end of procedure;
Solution of k means clustering algorithm based on MapReduce
MapReduce provides this software model and useful parallelism
Programs recorded in the software model are automatically paraffined in the distribution program [4]
Currently, distribution processing of images at a very small time becomes a relevant topic.
And the use of distribution computing in MapReduce technology - Hadoop is one of the main topics in the modern scientific and technical world
The main advantage of Hadoop technology is that it automatically allocates any large amounts of data transferred to several computers in distribution computing and saves time using two steps Map and Reduce, along with large-scale.
Difficulty solving the result of computing any large scale data on a single computer
This scientific problem began to be solved after the advent of Hadoop technology
Used when processing the distribution mapping of complex data
The clustering algorithm in Hadoop technology:
Initially, Mapper reads the entered values and compresses the original data into a subcomponent of the data, that is, into an auxiliary cluster
Creates a source cluster k from the secondary cluster for each Mapper Reduce
Reduce includes cluster from each Mapper and recalculates centroids for k cluster
These centrons are sent back to the original Mapper by exchange
Each Mapper reads a new centroid for the secondary cluster Mapper sends the cluster back to Reduce
Reduce restarts cluster and calculates new centroid
This procedure is repeated until Reduce stops sending data to Mapper
This usually ends when the algorithm is equal
Map function:
6:	dist	=	cal_dist_labpixel_to_centers(labPixel	Array[j]);	//primary	calculates the cluster centers, that is, the distance between the entered points
8: out _ value = in _ value ;//defines the location of pixel 9: writeToHDFS (out _ keyout _ value);
Reduce function:
+ + counter; }//calculates the new average value until the iterator is empty
The basic idea of a parallel k-means clustering algorithm is displayed in the classification of each point (pixel) based on the MapReduce in the Map function, the calculation of the nearest cluster and the center of new clusters is performed in the entire Reduce function
So, a serial and parallel version of the clustering algorithm k means was created using MPI technology in the Java programming language
In addition, the distribution algorithm is implemented in technology MapReduce
Table 1 - Processing time depending on value of input point of linear and parallel clustering algorithm
Figure 1 - Comparison of the processing time interval of the serial and parallel clustering algorithm
Figure 2 - Processing time difference of serial and parallel clustering algorithm
Table 2 - time interval in Java software environment using MPJ Express library and Hadoop technology depending on value of entered k means algorithm point
Figure 3 - Comparison of processing time interval of serial parallel and distributed clustering algorithm
Finally, the use of the MapReduce paradigm significantly reduced the time of the algorithm in image processing
In our practices, calculations are calculated using the MapReduce paradigm on the Hadoop platform for distribution computing
The use of the Hadoop platform allowed us to change the scale of the calculation of the report, providing calculation in several computing nodes
Specific calculations from created practices can achieve a linear acceleration of the calculation speed by increasing the number of nodes
With the help of conventional computers, we see that on the Hadoop platform, large amounts of data are efficient

The article will consider the course of informatics in medical universities
Three levels of training in informatics in medical universities are described
The article reflects the peculiarities of training in informatics in medical universities
Medical universities will consider the target tasks of teaching general education courses in informatics
Goals and objectives of training in information technologies in medicine and healthcare will also be announced
Keywords: informatics, level of teaching of informatics in medical universities, medicine and information technologies in the field of health, medical informatics
Currently, computerized cardiology, using coding methods for high-quality medical equipment, including digital information, digital X-ray technology, etc.
The increase in funds puts high requirements on the level of information culture of the future medical specialist
As you know, all this is related to computer technology
Therefore, it is impossible to imagine the future of a doctor who has not developed knowledge management skills in general education informatics
In this regard, training in informatics in medical universities is currently becoming one of the current problems
Training in informatics at a medical university, in our opinion, should be associated with three types of training
The first basic - the "standard" level of training in informatics - will be studied at higher educational institutions to fulfill the curriculum when studying in a selected specialty
As well as knowledge in informatics, corresponding to a working program prepared on the basis of a standard program of discipline in the preparation of specialties "medical care" and "pediatrics"
The second level of specialist training is intended for a specialist with higher medical education, as well as a specialized specialist in the field of special practical health care
The content of this level consists in the mastery of information technologies used at a particular doctor's workplace (provider - average medical worker)
This subject can be taught in internship
Levels of training in informatics in medical universities
Base Level
Profile level
Professional level
Knowledge management skills in general informatics, as well as the use of a competent computer aimed at active issues of medical informatics
Knowledge of medical informatics in professional activities (specialist doctor with computer technology, head of health care provider average medical worker)
Availability of specialized knowledge and skills in medical informatics
Programmer in applied medicine
Local Area Network Administrator and Automated Control System (Computer Doctor) of Application Programmer
Basic training in general informatics and medical informatics will be provided in accordance with the curriculum
The specialties "Pharmacy" and "Nursing" provide for the improvement of knowledge in general and medical informatics in accordance with individual training or advanced training
The third level is intended for a deeper mastery of discipline and the introduction of information technologies in the medical and diagnostic process and the management of higher-level specialists to increase scientific activity in the field of "special" informatics
Such information education requires individual training of a student in basic informatics in universities or universities or as part of a residency in the specialty "Medical informatics and an automated control system"
A deeper study of general medical informatics of the content of training, as well as the development of modern equipment (programming languages ​ ​ of Internet technology and artificial intelligence tools) is the creation of a software product in the medical sphere
Approves knowledge and skills in the subject of training in informatics in medical universities
In our opinion, training in informatics in medical universities will contribute to the uninterrupted provision of the needs of practical healthcare and pharmacy, which should be organized in stages
Training in informatics in secondary and higher medical schools has its peculiarities [1]
On the one hand, school physicians and students use public applications (spreadsheet text editor data fund management systems, browsers, mail programs, translation programs, etc.
) on the other hand, in training, special programs are needed that carry out the activities of a doctor - a fund of pharmaceutical data of medical information systems, etc.
to combine the tasks of teaching general and special specialized informatics between secondary and higher educational institutions, there should be continuity between the faculties of postgraduate institutions for advanced training of doctors
Now in the CIS countries we will focus on the timing of training in informatics at medical universities
For example, since 2000, the experience of training in informatics and medical informatics in the field of training future doctors in the field of medicine and health has been accumulated.
In particular, when training in informatics in medical colleges, general issues of medical organization - management of clinical informatics and laboratory informatics of information technologies will be studied and issues of structuring and operation of medical information systems will be considered
In medical universities, students study and carry out practical skills in general informatics in computer classes
At higher courses of medical universities, students will study medical informatics
In contrast to them, popular and accessible training programs in general informatics are used, and special software is used in medical informatics, widely used in medical and preventive institutions
Some medical universities use specially prepared medical information software to teach medical informatics courses [2]
It
as a result of the application of the software, students will be able to independently work with an electronic medical history and an outpatient card, as well as create conditions for assessing the advantage of medical information systems in practical work to study all cycles of information processing and storage
Future specialists prepared in this way have become not only good users, but also conductors implementing automation ideas
in addition, periodically and more deeply trained doctor actively stimulates the process of evolution of the information system and contributes to the improvement of software medical information systems manufacturers
As a tool for improving the technical cycle "Information Technologies in Medicine" at the faculties of advanced training of doctors, doctors expand the idea of ​ ​ special medical programs, increasing the skill of applying applications
At the same time, the database focuses on Internet technologies
Therefore, the training of informatics in medical educational institutions should be carried out in stages, and it is also necessary to use educational versions of special medical programs and use special educational literature of specific methodological approaches
Currently, in the system of training future doctors, medical universities produce textbooks and textbooks on informatics for doctors and use them in the educational process
Workshops on general education informatics are held at primary computer science courses in medical universities
In the most common software products in the lessons of the workshop, students can perform theory and tasks for learning [3-5]
The following software products will be used in the lessons of the workshop: Microsoft Windows XP operating systems vector graphics editor CorelDraw, as well as software products included in the Microsoft Office 2010 package: MS Word text editor of the MS Access data fund management system, MS Excel table processor
The fundamentals of Internet connection and functioning will also be considered
the Medical University of Kazakhstan-Russia Medical University learns the skills of working with various packages of programs depending on the topic of conducting classes in the subject of informatics; obtaining information by automated method is carried out in special laboratories of the course, covered by various instrument-computer systems and normal expert systems of automatic diagnostics, which process and analyze the received information
As you know, in preparation for wide information of future doctors in healthcare, the stage of familiarization of people with general informatics and informatization of medical science with new computer technologies has begun
Therefore, the purpose of training in general educational informatics is to form the ability of students to study other educational subjects and use the computer in their professions, necessary to form them directly as future doctors
Currently, medical forecasting widely applies quantitative indicators in the medical and preventive areas of disease
Depending on this situation
working capacity with computer education in medical education is extremely necessary
When teaching general informatics at medical universities:
formation of logical thinking of students for assimilation of basic concepts of informatization, application of standards and universal means of informatization for solving medical reports;
Use of well-established biomedical data processing programmes:
familiarization of students with the services of a wide territorial network: Internet e-mail information resources;
computer	networks	medical	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	application:	Internet resources consist of remote learning tasks
As a result of training in general computer science, students receive information about the computer; The basis of computer methods for storing and processing information necessary for the professional activity of a specialist; fundamentals of incompatimization and programming; new computer technologies; working with applications; Applications of biomedical data processing and statistical analysis software; The population (the production team of the region is a children's institution) should know the basics of methods for collecting and analyzing information on health
In the health sector, due to the discovery of biopharmacy and other factors in the processing of new devices for the constant improvement of diagnostic tools, we can notice the need for changes in the training of future doctors and specialists
Efficient technologies for health formation are traditionally called information technology in medicine
Currently, there are many types of specialized medical software
When solving all reports, there are specialized systems that correspond to the processing of medical information
The specialized medical system is conditionally divided into two: the medical information system and the means of the medical computer system
Key group of main means of healthcare informatization will be information system
Doctors need to master the subject of classification of information systems
The use of computer and management equipment in medical practice will allow, on a direct time scale, to process and manage its condition, new effective means to provide a new automated information set on the condition of the patient
This process leads to the creation of an instrumental method of intensive care research at a new qualitative level of the medical computer system (GKPC)
Knowledge for the doctor of the rules of software organization of hardware in the development and further development of the State Emergency Committee is necessary
Public health actively participates in the formation of informatization program
Doctors and organizers of practical health care are responsible for assisting in the competent use of new introduced information technologies and informatization
In recent years, the infrastructure of extensive electronic information resources has been established and put into operation in medical institutions
Therefore, the formation of a system of knowledge of qualifications and skills in teaching information and communication technologies of the course "Information Technologies in Medicine and Healthcare" the introduction of a personal computer in daily medical practice, students of medical universities use information and communication technologies in the educational process, as well as the informatization of health students
is an introduction to methods
In medical institutions of higher education
Based on the course "Information Technology in Medicine and Health":
application of modern computer programs in professional events;
application of the Medical Statistics programme in medical biological research;
application of specialized software equipment for decision-making by a doctor;
application by the structural management unit in a preventive medical institution of an automated workplace of an individual specialist;
health information movement management;
Set the task of building the ability to use the Internet and the local network

The concept of limit is one of the most important concepts of mathematical analysis, such as the concept of functional dependence
The concept of limit is applied in topics such as the product of continuity of a function and the revealed integral
Various methods for calculating the limit of a function are also known

Weak elliptic equations are the main equations of modern mechanics and theoretical physics
It is known that for differential equations such questions as loneliness and the qualitative nature of the solution arise, which are divided into three categories - the presence of a solution
To study the description of phenomena occurring daily, mathematical methods are used to indicate the adequacy of its mathematical scheme
Therefore, it is very important that the questions of the third category of elliptic equations be linear and non-linear

Modern information search systems can return search results of various types (audio-visual news) and various sizes
However, due to the large number of return values, the use of these systems becomes more difficult every year
Therefore, users need to independently review the results of each search and test the information and find the necessary information for themselves
The proposed work presents a method of automatically aggregating information sources into a unique document using thematic ontologies

In this work, we consider questions regarding the centralization of the following thermal conductivity equation within model [1], which the authors of the paper first introduced under the name multiscale random flow, as a model of understanding as a hierarchy of turbulent flows:

Described is the style and language of presentation of differential operators and distribution theory, the influence of future mathematics teachers on the development of speech culture
As an example, the Schrödinger operator is studied and its connection with quantum mechanics is provided
It is also explained that it complements each other in order to master the worldview methods of physical processes as in the sense of developing a culture of logical thinking of students.
The necessary theorems on the solution plane of this differential operator are given.
Quantum mechanics mathematical modeling logic of operator input theorem
It is known that the term "logic" comes from the Greek word loyos
This "thought" is the word "consciousness"
The concept of "legality" means that the process of thinking is used to denote a group of subordinate rules, that is, to denote the science of the rules of analysis and the form of its implementation
Logic studies the patterns and forms of thinking in which the substantive meaning and the process of coordinating consciousness are determined
Logic is a philosophical science, since it studies the process of worldview in full through philosophy

That is, any empirical cognition begins with perception through specific reasoning and feelings
There is no other tool in man than the senses, as a means of perceiving signals from the outside world to the human brain
As a form of intuitive perception, expresses a reflection that directly affects the sensory organs of some substances and phenomena
Each substance displayed through kinship has more than one property
The main forms that differ from this particular intuition are thinking and discussion of thoughts
Man strives to achieve the truth in the process of logical knowledge
The combination of the emergence of the main specifics of abstract thinking is that the laws of language expressions coincide with the implementation of semantic logical conclusions.
That is, any combination of words or sentences is a prerequisite for achieving the truth in the process of discussion, subject to the laws of logic (balance - no contradiction - sufficiency of justification)
These laws reflect that the uncertainty of thinking is an argument of thought and is due to a causal relationship and a reflection of relations between parts of the material world
The emergence of logic as a theory begins with the depth of millennial thinking practice
If we turn to history [1], we will see that some problems of logic appeared in ancient India 2-3 thousand years ago in ancient China in ancient Greece
History shows that one of the reasons for the emergence of logic is the emergence and initial development of science associated with the mathematics of the first of them

Melnikov warns of several points related to elements of the course of logic in the formation by students of the process of solving mathematical simulations:
Education consists not only in learning new concepts and acquiring relevant skills, but also in enriching the links between concepts
Enrichment we understand as increasing their number and deepening these ties
Deepening means creating new ties
Help culture begins with the use of help skills
As you know, the main goal of teaching elements of logic is to demonstrate the foundations of modern scientific thinking and scientific analysis than the stage of forming a generalized strategy for solving mathematical models [3]
One of the necessary conditions for the formation of qualified knowledge skills in solving problems to differential equations is good knowledge of the mathematical language
The content of language skills includes qualifications in the perception of definitions of various concepts
It plays an important role in proving the existence of solutions to differential equations when differential equations are not linear, as well as in separating the solitude of its solutions in the solution by the method of operators
New concepts found in functional spaces improve the mathematical logical thinking of students to know the definitions of strong solutions and the theorems of spatial implementation of weak solutions for the differential equations considered in them

The use of methods of differential operators of theorems of input of functional spaces in the proof of theorems 1-4 requires systematic logical thinking

The solution of the delivered report can be considered as a wave function in the system of quantum mechanics
It contributes to the description of the system of quantum mechanics and is called the amplitude of the probability of the square of its module
From quantum mechanics, it is known that the probability density of finding a particle at a point in space at a certain point in time is equal to the square of the absolute value of the wave function of the same state
The wave function found as a solution to the equation is considered as an element of Hilbert space
In the development of the student's logical culture, it is important to determine the role of space theory and training in the separation of operators in the internal development and applied directions of mathematics
Logical analysis of mathematical methods reveals the possibilities of the method and reveals the physical essence of the equation in question.
Thus, the study of mathematics and the application of mathematical modeling to practice complements each other in the sense of developing a culture of logical thinking of future teachers and in the sense of methods of knowing the world

Special points associated with the triangle have many structures and sections
This article examined the bisectors of any triangle and the properties related to the bisector
Triangle ceiling bisector divides opposite wall into sections proportional to adjacent walls
The properties of the circle chord are given and the bisector length formula is generalized
Based on these qualities, several reports submitted to UNT were presented and discussed.
Nodal words: triangular circle chord bisector
In this article, we analyze several reports submitted in UNT, taking into account the bisector of any triangle and its related properties
An article of this content with respect to the median was published in the previous issue 1 of the Journal of the Herald [1]
Angle bisector has angle symmetry value
Figure 1	Figure 2
To prove
Let the OS radiation have an AOV angle bisector (Figure 1)
Take any point K from OS radiation and build perpendicular to OS beam at point K
Logic of these perpendicular OA OV beams at D and E points
OCD and OCE triangles are equal, since OK is common and < KOE = < CODE
From the equality of these triangles EC = CD
If, instead of the point K, we construct another point M in the OS beam perpendicular to the OS beam at this point, then MN = MP, as proved above
That is, the points E and N are symmetrical to the points D and R with respect to the OS structure
In other words, the angle AOV is folded along the OS structure of the point D with the point E, the point R intersects the point N with the radiation OV (angle wall) OA, that is, the OS radiation is the symmetry of the angle AOV
Theorem proved
Geometric location of points (set of points), the angle bisector of which is located at the same distance from the walls of this angle
To prove
Remove perpendicular points of PRZ and KE from point K K to walls of RD and RD angle, extracting any point K along bisector OS of OC radiation angle (Figure 2)
Then ∆OEK=∆OED (in these right triangles the hypotenuse OK is common, and the corners of the PEC and KOD are equal to each other)
From the equality of these triangles, it turns out that the segments KE and KD are equal: KE = KD
Considering that the lengths of the sections CE and CD have a distance from point K to the structures CE and CA, then
Geometric location of points (set of points) located at the same distance from PC and OB of radiation angle OC, since point K is any point of radiation OC
Theorem proved
The internal angle bisector of the triangle ceiling breaks the wall lying opposite this ceiling, proportional to the adjacent wall
To prove
Figure 3 shows AA1 bisector of apex A of ABC triangle
Denote BA1 = c1 A1C = b1
The concept of the theorem should be understood as
If the slice AS is several times longer than the slice AV (shorter), then the slice A1C BA1

we must prove equality
For districts the following equality is fulfilled [2]:
If | AA1 | =𝑙A, then
From equations (1) and (2) c = c1
Theorem proved
By bisector property [3]:
The right sides of these equations are multiplied by the right, the left by the left:
That is, the following theorem is proved by Chev's theorem:
Internal angle bisectors of any triangle are competitive
Note
Segments passing through a single point are called competitive
Contras	from wall		bisector	what it's like to be	BA1=c1	and	A1C=b1	calculate length

From here	𝑐1
Now we calculate the cut length A1C (Figure 4):
So	BA1 = 𝑎𝑐

This article provides for students to work independently in the process of training in credit technologies
Methodological guidelines for teaching the subject of physics on the basis of credit technology are given
The application of innovative technologies to methods and methods of training in credit technology is reflected
Provides ways to use the interactive whiteboard effectively to meet the requirements of the new training technology
The method of organizing the student's independent work in the process of training in credit technologies is also presented.
Keywords: credit technology of training - independent work of students
Currently, all universities in the country are switching to a new training technology - the credit education system, introduced since 2004
The main feature of training in the credit system is the high-quality training of specialists needed in the country using the best technological practices of world education
The essence of the credit word is to entrust the student with the opportunity to creatively master each emerging topic in his independent search for increased knowledge [1]
In the credit system, the student has great trust and responsibility
The student must perform most of the tasks on his own
Performing independent work will affect the development of research skills in the mastery of educational material and creative activity of students
There is a possibility of wide application of interactive methods of realization of credit technologies
Here, it is important to use innovative technologies on case methods of training business games, allowing you to deeply master lecture materials as interactive teaching methods
The independent functioning of undergraduates under the guidance of a teacher in credit training technology is organized according to the following "pyramid of knowledge and action" system:
Listen to lectures	-	5 %
Working with tutorials	-	10%
Use of audiovisual media - 12%
Production of demonstration materials	to see	- 13 %
Group discussion of training materials	-	15 %
Practical actions	-	20 %
Training others (application of knowledge in practice)	-	25%
In addition to the daily interim assessment for each topic, the semester final assessment is conducted through test questions and examination tickets [2]
Training in the general course of physics using credit technologies will allow at the level of world standards to prepare physics specialists for the formation of the ability of students to self-education and self-development, to develop their skills and skills to independently creatively master knowledge
The main tasks of physics training using credit technologies include:
unification of knowledge;
creation of conditions for maximum individualization of training;
strengthening the role and effectiveness of the self-work of students and their intensification;
identification of real achievements of the student in study based on procedures of their effective control
When studying physics using credit technologies, students:
the ability to independently search for knowledge;
the ability to use interactive learning methods;
understanding the features of the case method and learning how to use it;
ability to pose and solve theoretical and practical problems;
should master modern information technologies
In the conditions of the credit system, students independently master the ways and methods of learning, find new sources of knowledge and knowingly transmit the received information
The content of the physics studied and the general system of the process should be aimed at ensuring that students can perform their work in creative conditions
The teacher acts as the coordinator of the educational process
The organization of training in the credit training system is carried out through the training and methodological complex, which is a document defining the specific concept of the training discipline course
The educational and methodological complex is created in order to improve the methodology for teaching the disciplines of general physics
The independent work of students in credit technologies is divided into two sections: independent work performed under the guidance of a teacher, and work performed by a single person
The main feature of credit technology is the creation of conditions for the independent development of students
In order to develop the ability of the student to organize his actions and improve his knowledge, a typical cycle is implemented between the teacher and the student: independent work of students (SRZ) and independent work of the student under the guidance of the teacher [3]
Priority aspects of the credit system requirements for strengthening the role of students in organizing independent work allow us to develop distance education, in other words, solve the problems of creating an open education system
Expands creative methods of conducting its activities with a teacher in the credit training system
He has the opportunity to change the content and types of independent work of students for formation
Erroneous opinion that only trainees are loaded in the credit training system
This system increases the mandatory requirements of the teacher
Competition in society should affect the creative growth of the teacher in the market
On the way of competing with other teachers in the discipline, he has his own knowledge and pedagogical skills
along with the improvement, qualitative signs of the use of interactive teaching methods are increasing
Independent work (CPS) of the student is a special type of educational activity of the student, aimed at independent fulfillment of the tasks of the educational process
SRH in extraconferential time with the participation of the SRH teacher is carried out outside the audience according to the list of tasks in accordance with the approved schedule without the participation of the teacher
Special attention in credit training should be paid to the student's independent work with the teacher
The organization of SOPS classes in the subjects of general physics goes through several stages
Firstly, each teacher needs to carefully analyze the tasks of students corresponding to their individual work
Secondly, the list of instructions should correspond to the calendar and thematic plan created within the framework of model programs of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Thirdly, evaluation criteria and deadlines for submission of methodological guidance requirements in accordance with the structure specified in the subject syllabuses of LMS topics, in accordance with its implementation, should be indicated
The materials of the SUR with processing by the faculty of the department include the following documents:
SRO schedule, designed for the entire time of training in the disciplines of general physics;
the general	physics	disciplines	to read	work	programs	and	in the main part of the model program	identified task system;
Topics of abstract reports and creative works;
Subjects of semester course and thesis works;
List of basic and supplementary literature;
Types of Soviet assistance;
Form and types of control;
Tentative period of scope of work, according to which price conditions are presented, its provision, etc.
SOPS indicates the types of tasks on topics with a general description of the amount of hours of disciplines of the work curriculum
The auditing form of SOPS provides for the work of students with individual analytical work performed as part of the task with the fulfillment of group tasks with textbooks and codes
For each discipline, SRO is carried out according to all academic flows in accordance with the schedule, which indicates the tutors of periodic auditors
The lesson conducted within the framework of SOPS can be in Soviet interactive form; Lesson organized within DIS:
a) conducting SRO in Soviet form in order to increase the level of training of undergraduates of low-temperature rating;
b) Provides for the issuance of orders for semester and course work and control over their implementation
CPS monitoring can be a record and oral form aimed at achieving the final result
The result of the students' independent work in the form of written control, the abstract report creative control work course work scientific article audiovisual accounting of thesis works, etc.
prepared as
Results of independent work of students in oral form of control: colloquium conference round table Business games, writing reports, separate interview, etc.
manufactured in types
The disciplines of general physics should contain in the credit system from a methodological point of view the following:
Two types of curriculum: for students (syllabus) and for teachers;
Syllabus - a program for teaching a subject with a short content of the goals and tasks of the subject, which shows the duration of each lesson and the topic of independent work tasks, additional time of classes, a criterion for evaluating the requirements of the teacher and a list of literature
The working curriculum is a working document of a specific university, compiled on the basis of a standard curriculum and supplemented in accordance with the content of the specialization direction and the subject of the component of a higher educational institution (university);
materials intended for audit work on each subject: the text of the lecture is the plan of the seminar, experimental and laboratory work, multimedia conduct of audit training (audio-video materials of electronic media information);
materials for students' independent work: text of homework, report abstract control work, methodological instruction for course work and other educational materials;
materials for student knowledge control: questions of written assignment, questions for interview, examination questions;
Methodological Guide for Pre-Diploma Training and Completion of Accounting Documents
In the work curriculum, the purpose of tasks on the technology and content of the subject training is determined
Summary of the subject The program should include the topics of CPS SOPS of the topic of teaching the subject of all types of classes, questions for checking the student's knowledge, the schedule for completing and conducting the task [4]
Interactive training in modular training of innovative technologies in methods and methods of training in credit technology
can be attributed to
Innovative teaching methods push teachers to self-search
Of great importance is the introduction of advanced innovative technologies in the educational process in order to form didactic materials to intensify the activities of students in the educational process who are interested in classes
There is a possibility of wide application of interactive methods of realization of credit technologies
Here it is important to use innovative technologies on case-methods of training business games, which open the way to deep mastery of lecture materials as interactive methods of training
The use of an interactive board in the process of teaching the subject of physics contributes to the growing interest of teachers and students in their relations to knowledge
In our office of innovative technologies, we have various virtual demonstrations in teaching physics to modern requirements (213 in total) with electronic textbooks (25 in total), an electronic version of books of the electronic encyclopedia on physics (150 in total), dedicated to the biography of scientists and reflecting fundamental experiments (45 in total) with an electronic lesson system
The office is equipped with an electronic board and computers
Our undergraduates and students come to this office at any time to record the information necessary to prepare for the classes
opportunities created
The office is also connected to the Internet
All this is aimed at further developing the refinement of knowledge received by the student in small numbers
Drawing schedule when organizing independent work of students in physics
photographic posters and positives are widely used
Also, multimedia information written for the student's independent work with a teacher is used in tapes reflecting the fundamental experiments of diafilms and minifilms for the biography of scientists, as well as for reading films from animation and videos only from text graphic images
Organization of students' independent work facilitates computer modeling and work with new information materials
For a number of students, such forms of work are more convenient, because they are more interested in working with a schedule that is comfortable for them than traditional learning.
The most efficient credit technology in the work of the teacher is beneficial when regularly researching and adjusting the knowledge of students
Active responsibility and students' own creative abilities will be formed
The student works independently
Sees the results of his work
There is an opportunity to monitor yourself
Completing tasks without the help of a teacher
Thus, mental and memorable abilities develop, which gives rise to the self-development of the person - his desire for search and self-education
The adoption of the results of students' independent work is carried out when analyzing the assessment of the quality of education and the results of methodological work after the organized course of general physics of the SUR and SOSE:
increasing the level of perception of theoretical knowledge by students;
increasing student training and business activity;
study showed an increase in student performance
Thus, the main goal of credit technology is the formation of self-education skills of a student

The article discusses methods of training students for national art using an interactive technology board at school
While the training of future teachers to teach students national art, on the one hand, involves modern socio-economic processes and adaptation to them, on the other hand, deviations in attitudes towards national art among young people are expressed due to changing demand and taste for art
Effective and effective methods have been identified for high-quality multidisciplinary activities of the technology teacher
Students' education is based on the improvement of the quality and mastery of the already established national traditions of art
Keywords: interactive training, national art of informatization of continuous education integration of new information technologies of pedagogical technologies
We live in a country that has attached great importance to improving public education in a peaceful country
The goal of general education is the formation of a person who is able to make decisions that are responsible from a moral point of view for self-development based on professional skills of deep education, that is, the formation of a modern new personality that changes rapidly with deep mastery of information technologies based on personality formation
Globalization intensifies global competition
Head of State N.
Nazarbayev called Kazakhstan competitive in the world
In his message "Strategy of becoming one of the 50 countries," he noted that "education reform is one of the most important tools to ensure the real competitiveness of Kazakhstan" [1]
"One of the main tasks of the education system is to create conditions for the development of educational programs"
- specified [2]
One of them is a didactic and learning computer in the informatization of education
Therefore, e-learning tools on a multimedia interactive whiteboard in any field of education are used to teach all subjects
In this direction, the introduction of information technologies in the training process is emphasized and one of the new application tools is the "Active Screen," which is a software and technical complex
Informatization of the educational process - training in development using new information technologies
improvement of efficiency and quality of all levels of educational process with exceeding
Competitiveness directly depends on education
We are applying to new technologies the long-used niterative means of other civilized countries associated with the new civilized development
This is a symbol of the progress of our Kazakhstan
In scientific education there is the possibility of an interactive board
Using interactive tools, the learner can move freely into the educational space [3]
The use of interactive tools in the educational process, including in practical classes, depends on the creative search of the teacher for personal experience
Interactive tools create opportunities to introduce new elements into traditional learning methods to transform the organization of the form of training
This will increase the interest of students in the subject
The rational use of interactive tools in the learning process will help improve the quality of learning
One of the lesson samples using an interactive technology whiteboard
Lesson theme: hook with us "Rose Flower"
The purpose of the lesson: to teach a loop to knit pink flowers with us

a) check of readiness for occupations
Publish Lesson Theme
Today we learn to "weave a loop with us"
This is known to many schoolchildren
Nevertheless, we think that everyone needs the technology to properly perform this art
Especially interesting art products
The ability to do household unique things through simple operations through a simple loop is certainly necessary in a new life
Content of the new topic
Knitting with us is one of the types of decorative and applied creativity
It allows you to be closer to art
Before you start working with us, we view video slides (3-5 minutes) through a computer and an interactive board
In addition, exhibitions made in the laboratory should be inspected in the safety rules of the equipment:
Display of items exhibited at the exhibition
With us a loop in photos and a fashion magazine at exhibitions through an interactive board
Knitted Substance Slide Overview
Also view the video recording of the method of knitting a pink flower through an interactive board
Equipment
The texture of the fabric, bound to us by a hook, is characterized by the density and slight extensibility of the corresponding thread
These properties allow us to use cotton mulberry when knitting a hook with us without using only a textile thread
By the thickness of the ornament and thread, the loop selects us
The metal hook is made of plastic wood
The loop can be different and our thickness (from 2 to 8 mm)
Loops with a diameter of 4-9 mm are used for articles made of thick wool textile thread
For daisy threads for iris muly, thin hooks of us are used (2-3 mm)
The loop should be twice as thick as the thread - we
Before you start knitting the product, you must first test the sample
Test rope thickness and match our hook thickness
Workplace Organization
Jobs will be prepared before work begins
When knitting, the light in this place should hit well on the left
It is necessary to ensure that the distance to the eyes and work is 35-40 cm, relying on the back of the seat
With too close a distance, vision can be reduced, and dust filament particles will fall into the eyes
When knitting, the thread must be on the ground in a special bottle
Safety Rules:
Before working, wash your hands
The hook must be cleaned well and stored in a special place
While working, the hook can injure a schoolboy sitting behind his back, who cannot help but move the hands that held us suddenly
Can not knit for several hours
Try to work 2 hours with a break
At the end of the work, all equipment must be put into a special place
Show Process Instruction Map Analysis Methods "Basic Loop Knitting Methods with Us" via Interactive Board
You often know how to knit the hook with us and remember that the hook holds us like a pencil in our right hand when the loop knits with us
The hook must turn to itself, no matter how our head moves
The top of the thread from the rope is pushed through the fingers of the left hand (on the nails) and squeezed with a thumb to itself
On one side, the thread is sent from under the middle finger, and then to four and under the fifth
Technique of basic hook knitting methods with us
In the process of knitting, the rope is in the left hand, and the loop is in the right hand
Self-employment of students
Knit the Pink Flower Loop with Us
First line: workplace organization and safety check of equipment acceptance required for operation;
The second line is to check whether the work procedures and the process flow are correct;
Third line: checking that the work is performed correctly
Acceptance and evaluation of self-test performance
Give additional tasks to students who have completed the task quickly
Eye breeding
Not in a hurry sitting on a bench, we look our eyes from bottom to top and vice versa (the head does not move), repeating 8-12 times
Now we look from right to left and vice versa
Repeat 8-10 times
Conclusion
Analysis of gross errors made by students in the process of work and their causes;
Conducting an activity (test work) to evaluate the theoretical knowledge of students in general
Evaluation of the work done by each student
The simpler the board and computer projector, the brighter the interactive board reveals the contents of the lesson
To achieve great success when using the interactive board, you only need to correctly plan classes
In the lesson, the teacher can use the interactive board more than once and saves time using the interactive board than a regular board
How to properly allocate time to prepare for classes? How to prepare the visual aids used in each lesson
? We try to answer these questions
Interactive whiteboard has more achievements than other learning methods [4]
Only teachers who use the interactive board in their lessons can tell about these achievements
By preparing for classes with employees and like-minded people, you can achieve a good effect, which will not only allow you to allocate tasks and save time, but also improve the quality of the materials provided
How does an interactive whiteboard improve learning efficiency? Will the use of the interactive board in the lesson increase the child's interest in the subject at school? How do you do that?
In this article, we consider 3 areas of use of the interactive board in the field of education [5]:
A presentation can improve the quality of the lesson by showcasing and displaying interactive whiteboard models
Increasing student interest in classes
How to Increase Learner Activity When Using the Interactive Whiteboard in Lessons
Increase the pace of classes using the interactive board
How to schedule classes and increase its pace when working with an interactive whiteboard
Teachers	by readings	interactive	program	them	performs partial work
For example, by running a specific material on an interactive whiteboard, you can save characters and changes to the file without being in the lesson.
remaining students can be explained or applied again the next time
Creating a training material base saves teaching time by using materials created by colleagues in their lessons
Using an interactive whiteboard in the study of materials will expand the field of knowledge, so the material prepared by teachers will be understandable to students
As many teachers have noticed, the lesson will be interesting and motivated by students and will be quickly remembered by students
Interactive board saves teachers time to improve the quality of training, Teacher uses the interactive board to re-view previously conducted materials
You need to correctly understand the interactive board, it is not a wizard's wand
Because all the questions in the lessons are programs, lesson plans
quality correctness only due to teacher's work
An interactive board can be used in all classes, especially at each stage of classes with low student perception, if this is not difficult to explain
Software instruction accompanying the interactive board should be used in preparation for classes
Summing up the above, it follows that the lesson must be prepared in advance, and only then will the materials be explained and understood.
On the interactive board, you can use several materials at the same time: the text of the video sound image and t
Until the end of the lesson, logically continuously, and only then will the lesson achieve its goal
Files stored during the lesson are passed to students, which are used to repeat and supplement the materials in the next lesson
The process of learning through computers and interactive tools should contribute to the formation of new mental abilities among students, as a result of which they will be able to find patterns in systemic connections - to create their professional potential
Today, only pedagogical technologies that shape students' thinking and spread the general patterns of development of computer education can be considered effective in the information society zone.
Since students' thinking ability, formed and implemented through interactive tools, will differ from the system of thinking transmitted through previous technologies, a high level of memory will have not only an understanding of thinking ability, but also perception.
You can note the following features of interactive tools [6]:
An image applied to a board with a boron cannot be mapped to a pronounced neat color pattern on the interactive board
It is difficult and impossible to explain how to work with various applications using a board and board
In slides, you can quickly fix flipchete errors
In the lesson, you can use the test capability via the ACTIVote test system
Allows access to the top of the panel using ACTIVwand
The level of application of visibility in the lesson will increase
The quality and visibility of the sessions will be improved
Positive impact on student education
In summary, the rational use of interactive tools will help improve the quality of training
An interactive whiteboard is an effective tool that generates a generalized information qualification of all lesson participants by processing the information needed for one environment.
Pre-prepared training materials: presentations, text graphic information objects - ensure good passage of the lesson and use of all types of information

The article provides two thematic and methodological aspects of the system of innovative training in laser physics
for undergraduates 6M060400-Physics courses 2 specialties and high school students profile school
Programs of innovative special and elective courses "Physics of Lasers" have been developed
The course structure includes three logical units: historical physical and cultural-social units
Forms and methods of the elective course are summarized
Marked differences in courses held in schools and higher education institutions are shown
Keywords: physics of lasers, master's school, training in innovative technologies
The 20th century is not only really an "atom" or "space," but also
The age of "lasers" can also be called
It is difficult to find a field of science and technology that in the modern world does not use the specific properties of laser radiation
One way or another, only one smaller paragraph is intended for lasers in the textbook on physics of the school [1]
In contrast, pedagogical universities have a wider range of materials dealing with the topic of lasers
In any case, the history of the development of laser physics, its socio-cultural and methodological aspects, scientific and practical applications of laser technology remain without the attention of schoolchildren and students
"Physics of lasers": a special and elective course on the content of history and applied structures requires the use of an innovative methodological training system in the educational process
In this regard, two types of innovative steps can be distinguished: thematic and methodological
In other words, you need to understand what training is (determining the content of the educational material) and how training (creating the methodology for its training)
Let us first focus on the thematic (substantive) aspect of the innovation step.
Take as usual the fundamental and applied sections of laser physics
The first of them has a very large methodological and scientific and cognitive potential
Indeed, after the discovery of lasers between linear and non-linear physicists, its own bridge was built
The previously known physical phenomena and laws that are now being studied are linear in nature.
This also applies to optics
In connection with the development of vacuum and solid-state electronics of radio engineering and radiophysics of the second half of the 20th century, new scientific directions appeared without a line - optics and physics of lasers
The above fact is the most important, since modern physics is unceremonious and its further development does not come out of this channel
The rationale for the nonlinearity of physics of the 21st century - the uniqueness of an innovative idea lies in training in laser physics
Given that laser physics is considered as part of quantum mechanics, we see that it, in turn, coincides with the physical image of the modern world
Speaking about the applied nature of laser physics, half a century ago, when the principles of laser operation were not widely known, only the word "possible" was added about their use.
Today it is difficult to calculate the entire applied "specialty" of the laser
Since the mid-1960s, scientists have paid special attention to the invention of new types of lasers
Lasers in pairs of solid-state semiconductor gas metals began to use organic colorful solutions made by chemical lasers as an active medium, made by lasers on free electrons and in paint centers
The range of frequencies at which laser installations operate, on the way to 50 years of intensive development, has expanded, reaching the gamma range first from the radio beam to the X-ray
In the 1970-1980s of the last century, laser devices were actively improved: angular ruptures of rays and other laser radiation parameters were improved to control the spectrum of radiation created
Over the past decade, communication has become the most important area of ​ ​ laser applications
Thanks to their innovative improvement, the development of the telephone system accelerated the radio and television broadcasting of the satellite optical fiber communication system
Micro- macro- lasers
and in various fields of megaphysics: from chemistry to astrophysics - from mobile telephony to nuclear physics - space research to medicine - to deep cooling of atoms
In addition, many discoveries of laser physics are awarded Nobel Prizes [23]
However, the applied problems of lasers in schools and universities lead to stories about the simplest use of laser radiation
A dramatic change in this situation is one of the most important innovative tasks
Move to the second edge of the innovation step
Laser physics, like the modern direction of fundamental science, is mathematically complex
Therefore, it would be nice to go to his mathematical apparatus, that is, to methods of high-quality education, which can be applied not too deeply and equally in school and pedagogical educational institutions
Of course, the theoretical depth of the content of educational material in this case will inevitably decrease, but if there is no benefit from such optimization, since we do not train laser designers and specialists using them, then there will not be so much harm
High-quality teaching methods expand students' scientific and cultural views, as well as increase interest in the necessary emotional background and topics
This approach is an innovative step
It forms the correct attitude to laser physics - one of the main sections of modern physics
Effective is the study of the physics of lasers by the method of high-quality education in the framework of a special course "Physics of Lasers" (in a pedagogical school) or an elective (in an oriented school) course
This will allow, on the one hand, the inclusion in the standard table of hours, on the other hand, in the presentation of its content will also lead to the use of modern advanced training methods (primarily computer)
Due to the fact that laser physics is innovative, it is also necessary to apply innovative methods to its training
In our opinion, multimedia lectures distributed in pedagogical universities are correct
Therefore, we propose to develop a work plan of the Special course "Physics of Lasers" for undergraduates of the second year 6M060400-Physics specialty
This course is designed for 3 credit (30-hour lectures and 15-hour workshops) loads
The creation of a strong and systematic education will allow undergraduates to familiarize quantum physics in detail with the holography of laser technologies and the historical development of modern science
It should be noted that historically physical actions are very important for the formation of individual undergraduates, contributing to the humanization of physical education
Purpose of course training:
modern	modern	world	image	I	scientific	outlook	formation of methods;
development of creative and value relations in the study of physics and other natural sciences
The objectives of the course training are:
familiarization of undergraduates with the history of the development of laser physics and the biographies of scientists who invented it, with modern research and practices that underlie the development of this area;
providing theoretical information explaining the basics of laser physics, information about the device and principles of operation of various lasers, their application in science and technology;
developing the cognitive interests of undergraduates, intellectual and creative abilities
The course structure consists of three logical sections:
History of the emergence of quantum electronics ") the physical section (" Fundamentals of laser physics ") and the cultural and social section (" Basic types of laser construction and their use ") [4]
Headings and summary of headings are shown in Table 1
Knowledge of the history of physics, like any history, is caused by the need for rational development of mankind due to the importance of understanding the causal laws of the surrounding world
It is known that without studying the foundations of physical science it is impossible to know its history [4]
Therefore, the course of laser physics will naturally include the second section on the legislation of electrodynamics and physical phenomena that determine the work of lasers
At the same time, the theoretical level of the content of the transmitted material depending on the specialty of the students may be different
Headings and Summary of Headings
The third part of the proposed course is of a technical nature
Today it is impossible to study the physics of lasers, not to mention the device and use of various lasers
The content of the voiced questions includes not only the general device of the quantum generator, but also features when using feedback devices of various full inversion filling systems
A lot of attention is paid to modern types of lasers
As for their use in the national economy and everyday life, priority is given to modern applications - computer communication technology, space research and other innovative devices
The above programme model can be modified in terms of both subject and time of study, as it is of a general nature.
Forms of elective courses include a multimedia lecture workshop and student knowledge control lessons
Participants in laser physics courses expect the teacher to make extensive use of multimedia technologies due to the active introduction of computer technologies in the educational process
Multimedia technology [56] is considered as a training information technology that combines all kinds of audio-neutral information, performs interactive dialogue and various forms of information processing between the system and the user.
The leading form of elective course training is multimedia lecture [5]
Of course, it is impossible to limit the use of other forms of education in which the degree of education can be controlled
However, the computer workshop of laser physics is not yet used at its level due to the complexity of its creation
Briefly list the methods of elective course training:
methods of organizing educational and cognitive sin, which are divided into visual practical ones;
methods of stimulating educational activities, which are divided into the formation of controversial cognitive interest;
control methods, which are allocated for final presentations of test testing of individual and general educational knowledge
A similar course in laser physics has been prepared for undergraduates in the natural sciences of a pedagogical university
It is based on historical and physical approaches, didactic and methodological approaches
The course has a clear pedagogical orientation, as well as a significant depth of educational material
Thus, the history of laser physics can be considered from several points of view
For example, from a physical point of view, undergraduates try to absorb the material provided by the degree of all the knowledge gained during their studies at the university
The proposed course adds a historical approach to the physical approach, because a very high level of scientific technologies used in everyday life has been adopted by modern great thinkers
The course can also be viewed from a cultural and social point of view, since laser technologies have a great influence on the formation of the modern information society
Innovative (including historical, physical and computer) approaches used to teach modern physics (using the example of laser physics) contribute to the expansion of the scientific and cultural thinking of students and undergraduates, as well as the choice of future professions by students

The article reflects the directions that make it possible to solve, as a result of accelerated development of applications, a new field of applied mathematics focused on an artificial neural network over the past decade
Processes of software or hardware implementation of mathematical models based on organization and functioning of artificial neural networks - nerve cells of living organism are considered
Discussed the basis of work with the properties of the Hopfield model, which is a general representation of the multi-layer perseptron model
Models of multidisciplinary neural networks - automation of pattern recognition, which are the relevance of research in this direction - present the scope of application of associative memory organization component of the expert system for predicting functional approximation
The main problematic issues solved with the help of artificial neural networks in accordance with the variety given in the work are revealed
Models of neural automation networks approximating the artificial neural network of the neural network
Introduction
A network typically consists of one or more hidden layers (hiddenlayer) of computational neurons and one output layer (outplayer) of neurons with multiple sensory elements forming an input layer or input source
Input signal propagates from floor to floor in forward direction
Such networks are commonly referred to as a multidisciplinary perseptron network
How to solve the fundamental limitations of homogeneous neural networks that satisfy the requirements of linear classes, multi-hour (hierarchical) neural networks
In most cases, it is impossible to implement everything at once, but they can be divided into parts
To do this, the storey of the neural network is determined, which must be solved
The output signals of neurons in multilayer networks play the role of input signals before them
Neurons of the next layer serve as a receptor to neurons of the next layer
Refer to the mixed layers of neurons as a corresponding accident, and the connections between the layers with N distributed intermediate layers as a degree N
Random relationship sequential 0 degree
The intermediate layer of neurons is called multilayer
Perseptron - an output image, usually determined by the upper layer neuron, not found, is translated by the causative agent into an incoming image that determines the level of the receptor
Characterizes the belonging of neurons to the input image of a class at the level of a high hierarchical network
Thus, a multilayer perseptron is a training determining system in which a linear rule teacher, corrected and carried out during training, is usually randomly selected using the first characters with linear functions
Thus, a multilayer perseptron is usually with linear functions, randomly chosen using the first symbols and through secondary signs
large system that corrects and is implemented by the instructor of line rules during training [1]
Next signals are transmitted that study the selection of input perseptrons during reading
The class of signals for data transmission is also indicated
The study of perseptrons consists in determining the mass of correction of the error of determining each error
If the perseptron erroneously classifies signals of some classes, the accuracy of the function increases and the error decreases
With the correct solution, the weight remains unchanged
This random simple algorithm has strong properties: these values ​ ​ are easily executed in the last value of the interation when selected, if the selection has a division value without errors.
When identifying recognition, the income of the multilayer perseptron receives a signal with its own first features determined by receptors
Secondary characters are considered the first
Each such second characteristic corresponds to the first line sign
The second sign is 1 if the corresponding linear function exceeds the penetration ladder, in the opposite case it is 0
After that, the secondary characteristics of the linear function are defined for each class
Perseptron, corresponding to parameters of the second function, makes a decision on input signals classified into that class with the greatest nervousness [23]
To determine nonlinear functional features in accordance with the student's choice, the bilayer neurons themselves are enough
But in practice, using more than one hidden layer in the case of complex functions saves the full number of neurons
Hopfield Model (J
Hopfield 1982) for the first time it is possible to establish a connection between nonlinear and dynamic systems and neural systems
The Hopfield model is a common representation of the multi-layered perseptron model and has the following two new properties
In the neural network, all neurons are connected to each other 𝑊𝑖𝑗
The connections between neurons are symmetrical: 𝑊𝑖𝑗 = 𝑊𝑗𝑖
Spontaneous neurons contactless 𝑊𝑖𝑖 = 0
Each neuron can be in only two modes
Movement of all neurons sequentially or simultaneously (parallel)
perhaps, but the properties of the Hopfield network do not depend on its dynamics
Neural network interaction is described below
element of interdependent matrix W, consisting of weight coefficients of communication between neurons
In this teaching process, the M-shaped binary vector matrix N:
The Hopfield network is a recursive network with dynamic associative memory controlled by the system
Variables {0 1} are used instead of variables {-1 1}, and the component dynamic system 𝜃 = 0 is of the following type:
S - memory etholone n - number of neurons in system L - number of etholons
r = L/n can be estimated using the central theorem if the memory volume is greater:
System	energy	ideas	brought	moment	key	having visited	is (J
Figure 1
For a dynamic system, energy is considered a Lyapunov function (16)
Dynamic system H is cancelled
However, it corresponds to the statistical mechanics of the physical system of the adaptation function in evolutionary biology
Memory vectors, which are attractors of dynamics, are located on the minimum energy local upper layer [6]
The hopfield network cannot recognize objects with incomplete and noisy input data with recognition properties, but when the image is located or rotated a certain degree from the original relative state
The operation of the network in recognition is to put the network in a normal stable state with any initial state x0
If the case x0 is a distorted type of one of the memory etholons and the point x0 of the phase space of the dynamic system is in the attractor attractor attraction basin Sl, then the network forms the formality state Sl corresponds to the "self-formation" of this etholone
The most important feature of the hopefield network S1... SL (in the name of "foreign" memory, i.e. spuriousstates) is all other dynamic set of additional permanent attractors
The properties of foreign memory have been sufficiently studied
Including with L growth with actual results indicating an exponential increase in the number of "extraneous" attractors
The sharp increase in the number of additional attractors in the L increase is the main reason for the low corrosion of Hopfield network memory
Due to decrease of attraction and stability of etholone basin in L growth the quality of etholone self-formation has decreased sharply [34]
Issues addressed by neural networks
Currently, neural networks are used to solve large-scale problems that are an established model of human brain activity
Below [3], the main problematic issues solved using artificial neural networks in accordance with the class [5] given in the work are identified:
Image Classification/Recognition
Show who owns the incoming image, consisting of one or more defined classes represented by the task designation vector (for example, through a sound label or signature mark)
Letter recognition to name applications Classification of sound recognition signals electrocardiograms Blood cell classifications fingerprint recognition
Task clustering
"flawless" image classification
There is no selection of the instructor through the class sign
Clustering algorithm based on images
They collect similar images in one cluster
The clustering method is used to recover compression data when determining the composition of data
Dresser selection hole generated by an unidentified (x) function twisted by noise
Find an estimate of a function (x) that does not have an approximation job defined
Function approximation is required to define modules of multi-valued engineering and scientific task
Forecasting/forecasting
discrete census with consecutive moments during t
The next time t > n + 1 is to predict the values of y (t) in the circuit
Forecasting/forecasting has a volumetric impact in business on decision-making in science and technology
In the context of the forecast of prices on the stock exchange and the adaptation of weather to an unfamiliar environment, the main issue is the solution of mobile autonomous systems in which the student himself is trained
Many issues in medicine and economics in science in technology in mathematics can be considered as efficiency issues
Optimization task - find a solution to reduce or increase the target affiliation and satisfy the limitation system
An example of a salesman in a full NP class is a classic example of an efficiency problem
Associative Memory
The content-oriented associative memory or memory composition may be formed from incomplete revenue or distorted content
Associative memory is used to create a fund of multimedia information
It is also the basis of the mobile robot control system
Management
Consider the dynamic system defined by time (u (t) y (t)} where: u (t) is the revenue control effect (t) is the system time expenditure
In reference model control systems, the system is a calculation of the yield effect (t) moving in the direction specified by the reference model
An example is the engine control path [5-7]
The study examined the main models of neural networks and compiled comparative characteristics of neural network models
Proprietary properties of multilayer neuron information system model and Hopfield model capabilities are presented
The effectiveness of neural networks in the field of their application was determined

This article provides for the taxonomy of Blum as a variation of the new method of learning
The steps of bloom taxonomy applied during classes and the advantages of application in professional training lessons are shown
To reflect the specifics of the application of Bloom taxonomy, lesson plans were developed and classes were held on various subjects
In the course of the practice giving a general characteristic of the taxonomy of Blum, an exemplary lesson plan conducted through this taxonomy was presented
The results of the obtained achievement of the lesson are plotted on the diagram and descriptions are compiled
System of synthesis of stages of innovative technologies of blum taxonomy
Most of the world's leading countries will assess education against its goals and results
The current goal of education is not only the achievement of knowledge and skills, but also independent social and professional power on their basis - analysis and search for information
Sustainable use is a decent life and work in today's rapidly changing world
"To become a competitive developed country, we must become a country of high literacy" [1]
Therefore, our main task is to prepare competitive youth using an effective educational system of a particular field of education [2]
Learning by Blum technology is one of the learning technologies aimed at exploring in balance with opposing views on these ideas, combined with new knowledge, adopting a certain idea and studying what it relates to.
Mainly over 30 years of operation, the Blum taxonomy has a significant impact on the educational process, which indicates the systematic application of this technology in European schools
If we were able to systematically use not only this taxonomy, but also taxonomy, as a stage of triangular taxonomy, then indifference to this occupation would be lower.
These taxonomies are currently not widely used in educational institutions of our country
In this work, we consider the difference between the taxonomy of Blum and the above taxonomies and the peculiarities of its application in the disciplines of professional training [3]
The Blum taxonomy consists of the following stages:
Knowledge: an actual response made using the "Attack on the Brain" method
Memorizing Memorization
Understanding: systemic response at the stage of "thought arousal"
Translation of interpretation from one language to another
Ability to understand a given task
Applying Information to Achieve Success
Analysis: uncover a task that can actively think rationally
Split into several sections to show your knowledge
Picking:	Essenin	pithiness	no errors	writing
from the word	good result at object or object
Evaluation of knowledge results
Decision to create a contradiction [4]
The description of the teacher's actions and expected results when conducting classes in vocational education classes in accordance with the specified stages of the training goals is shown in Table 1
In the case of systematic and correct fulfillment of the stages specified in the table, we are likely to pass professional educational classes at a high level and achieve our goals
The goal set for educational institutions is the development of education and educational work through educational technologies, systematic clear personal education to improve the socio-economic situation of the country.
Table 1 - Explanatory table of teacher's actions and expected results during classes
An exemplary electrical training plan according to the Blum taxonomy steps in Table 1 is as follows:
Lesson Topic: Galvanic Cells
The objectives of the sessions are:
Knowledge of the concept of electrochemical cell for students
Development of creative and design abilities of students of technical thinking, skills of independent work;
Educate students in the right and effective use of information in conscious activities when receiving information on tolerance of learning
Class Type Mixed Lesson
Lesson methods and techniques: Display posters with answer questions through an interactive board, Explain processes through clarity
Interdisciplinary Communication: Physical Mathematics Chemistry
Presentation Layout Cards
Organizational Stage, Last Topic Homework Checked; testing students' knowledge with a dictionary linking homework and a new lesson
As a result of the lesson, students systematized knowledge and learned to correctly express their opinion and appreciate not only themselves, but also someone else's opinion.
Repetition issues that serve as a basis for learning a new lesson on the topics on which homework was conducted:
What are electrolytes?
What are conductors of the first kind?
What are electrolytes?
How many types of ions?
What is electrolytic dissociation?
What does Faraday's law define?
II New Lesson
Creating conditions for students to learn a new lesson independently during group work: (a) students:
"Analysis" "Synthesis" independently completes tasks in accordance with the stages "Assessment" (10 minutes); a) analyzes the answers with the teacher (10 minutes)
Indicators of the "Knowledge" criterion by theory: who in terms of the content of the topic creates the conditions for the independent mastery of the new lesson? what? which one? how? what? when? Complete information should be selected to answer questions such as:
The result of one step is estimated at 2 points
Students understand the rules and rules of concepts of a specific sequence of terms
From the general theory, the teacher gives a little information (slide through explanatory cards)
Indicators of the "Understanding" criterion by theory (by the content of the topic? why? the reason? Are questions asked about the student's above answers to deepen them?)
The second step is evaluated by article 2
The teacher explains the main provisions of the new lesson

Report Output
In practice, in accordance with the "Synthesis" criterion, when working with a textbook, only simple tasks are fixed
Reports on finished formulas are displayed
The fifth step is measured in 2 points
Students will be able to summarize their thoughts through reference abstracts
"Assessment" (do you think? What are you doing?) Can appreciate yourself by asking questions
"learning" when performing level tasks, that is, working with tasks for new classes
We choose these tasks in accordance with the age characteristics of the student, the minimum knowledge threshold of which does not exceed the size of the program in accordance with the requirements of the state standard
performance of application-level tasks "analysis" is transformed and complicated
The student independently checks himself
Record performance was significantly higher than required
"set" to "generalization" level tasks
vision-level tasks are designed mainly for children with high demands on talented applicants
Figure 1 - Results of assessment of students by traditional classes and assessments of past classes by taxonomy of Blum
As can be seen from the diagram, divided into four parts 08
2014, that is, in traditional classes, and the first and second parts 26
Student assessments of lessons that passed through the Blum taxonomy in 2015
If we consider general schooling to be a twenty-point scale, then the grades of the traditional lesson are on the fourteenth scale, and the grades in the lesson passing through the Blum taxonomy show eighteen scales
We believe that although there are not many differences in general, in this way we will be able to give the child much more knowledge through smaller differences
When conducting classes using this taxonomy, all students are evaluated in each lesson
Not to mention the fact that in a traditional lesson education takes place in a low degree, we showed the advantage and effectiveness of Blum taxanomy in a comparable form
With the correct application of the given innovative method in the lessons of vocational education, we certainly contribute to increasing the interest of students in the subject with the expansion of knowledge and systematic adoption of educational materials.

The article presents the results of the study of the dynamics of mass pumping processes in cylindrical samples of cotton cavity
Models of cylindrical shape made from monothermite natural mud raw materials are obtained as object of investigation
Research carried out through computational practices
Mathematical model of mass pumping processes and accuracy conditions was determined, computational experiments were carried out using a computer program
Results of investigation of dynamics of mass pumping processes during dehydration occurring during firing of monothermite ceramic samples are analyzed
Mass transfer cotton process dynamics model firing dehydration
In technology, transport processes that take place in production under non-thermal conditions are often found.
Since such processes are more complex than isothermal processes, they require special research
In connection with the intensive development of computer technology, work on quantitative modeling of such processes is rapidly developing [1-3]
In previous published scientific work [4] under isothermal conditions on hairpin cylindrical samples
results of quantitative modeling of diffusion processes dynamics are considered
In this work results of quantitative simulated study of dynamics of mass pumping processes under non-thermal conditions of such samples are presented.
It takes into account the specifics of only the non-thermal situation, based on the conditions of accuracy [4] in previous studies
This makes it possible to compare dynamics of investigated processes of mass pumping under non-thermal conditions with results obtained under conditions of isothermal contract
Samples of classical form (infinitely flat plate-like infinite cylindrical balls) were taken as a mathematical model of the studied process, that is, a certain differential mass equation written for a one-dimensional coordinate system [12]:
where is the relative mass (potential) of the contact substance  - time x -
Potential strength factor for transportation of AU-object G-constant
for the infinite plate G  0 (x  x) for the infinite cylinder in our case
G  1 (x  p) a for ball (sphere) G  2 (x  p)
In the course of computational practices, a clear one-time scheme of the mass fuel equation was used as an algorithm (1)
We write down a specific difference scheme (1) with the replacement of independent products in the equation with point boundary connectors [23]:
where
step by coordinate, - step by happiness;
U - i
at point
(k) time	instantly	potential	values;
U k 1 - +  	(k+1)	time
potential in our case relative mass of bound substance type
From this we obtain an algebraic equation for the temperature values ​ ​ at the i-th point along the radius of the cylinder (r) at a certain (k 1) time:
 and r
using clear difference schemes for correct value selection
defined by a certain condition
The possible value of the step in time is limited and depends on the step in coordinate and the potential conductivity coefficient of the material (substance) under study, and this is called the stability condition:
or
if present, said one-time circuit is unstable
cannot get the correct solution to the equation
Calculation experiments were carried out by the method of quantitative investigation of the dynamics of the massatamalization process during the dehydration of crystalline compounds with non-thermal heating of cylindrical samples by the method of plastic molding from monothermite mud raw materials
Features of non-thermal state in this process
effective potential activity factor for mass photography varies by the following definite equation depending on temperature
where

Temperature value at the time
For the analysed monothermite mud model the following values detected in practice are obtained:
Ceramic samples of cylindrical shape are heated by linear pattern between 800-1000K temperatures
where T
The constant heating rate is defined by the following expression:
Duration of process (tu ud) 30; Corresponding heating rate values equal to 60 and 90 minutes are determined
In order to carry out computational practice, the following specific conditions have been adopted
Physical Condition Group
Ceramic samples of cylindrical shape from monothermite natural mud raw materials are obtained as the object of investigation
The potential resistance factor (AU) values for mass heat transfer are defined by (4).
Geometric Condition Group

The relative weight of water in the (chemical) bond was U (0 p)  1  const
The mass shooting process is provided in the conditions of the border agreement of the first kind
Under this agreement, the relative amount of bound substance in ceramic samples (samples) varies by linear pattern:
Ceramic	in samples	diffusive	processes	(800-1000K)	investigated under non-thermal conditions in the temperature range

the velocity values were as follows:
Thus, during the firing of cylindrical samples from monothermite natural mud raw materials using an electronic computer using the above equations (3) (4) as an algorithm, the dynamics of mass testing processes by conducting computational experiments was comprehensively studied
Computer programs created and calculated in the language TurboPASCAL using Pentium 4
Some results of the calculation practice are given as an example in Figures 1-3.
Under non-thermal conditions, samples with identical diameters of cylindrical shape (d = 2r = 2sm) from monothermite mud raw materials
shows the dynamics of the mass pumping process when heating 30 60 and 90 minutes at different intervals

drawing
Dynamics of the process of non-thermal mass distribution during dehydration of a cylindrical sample (diameter d  2r  2sm) from monothermite natural mud raw materials
From the above images, it follows that the relative mass fields of the contact substance under non-thermal conditions are parabolic in dehydration
We see that these fields are qualitatively similar, and quantitatively comparable changes increase due to an increase in the heating rate, the intensity of mass processes of the type
And due to the increase in model diameters at the same heating rates, it is quantified that the intensity of diffusion processes in accordance with them slows down
Comparing the dynamics of diffusion processes in isothermal conditions in cylindrical samples with the results of quantitative modeling (Fig. 1-3) published in the previous published article [4], the dynamics of non-thermal mass rolling shows that the dynamics of isothermal massaging are similar to the conditions of temperature T = 900K
Along with the scientific and technological significance of the obtained results, by conducting computational practices, one can note the educational and methodological significance
It is possible to organize and carry out a new computer laboratory workshop on molecular physics based on the obtained scientific and practical results

The accelerated increase in the world is expressed empirically in the implementation of the Hubble Act and many other methods
Scientists predicted and substantiated this theoretical phenomenon based on the general theory of relativity and the general philosophical conclusions of the World as homogeneous and isotropic
Based on the accumulated data, it was concluded that a forced increase in the world occurs under the influence of any dark energy [1]
Unfortunately, many theoretical models characterizing the increase in the World correspond to observations to date (the results of observations of the appearance of anisotropic supernova baryons of a CMBR-large-scale structure), but are difficult due to the energy scale of the vacuum.
There are other ways to theoretically describe a progressive increase in the world

In this work, a nonlinear model of the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule is investigated by theoretical physics
The DNA molecule is considered on the basis of a simple dynamic model of the DNA macromolecules of Yakushevich and Ryasik
In this model, analytical solutions of a homogeneous chain consisting of the same type of nucleotides were obtained single-solitonically using the non-linear sine-Gordon equation
Based on this model, solutions for various values ​ ​ of the dissipation coefficient are obtained
External force influence and dissipation rate are envisaged
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotide DNA macromolecule nonlinear model dynamics of DNA macromolecule equation sine-Gordon dissipation coefficient
Introduction
Deoxoribonucleic acid (DNA) is one of three species of biological macromolecules (RNA proteins)
Macromolecule, which manages the transmission of all living organisms from generation to generation and preserves genetic information and the program of life of organisms to the next generations, as well as retains information about the structures of RNA and proteins
Chemically, DNA is a long polymer molecule consisting of a cytosine (c) adenine (a) thymine (t) guanine (g) chain of four species of nucleotides:
Each nucleotide nitrogen base consists of sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate group
DNA macromolecules consisting of two such long strands binding in a complementary manner to another strand through such long strands of DNA macromolecules typically form a twist structure in the form of a double helix.
The adenine in one chain in the double helix structure corresponds to the tim of the other chain and corresponds to the cytosine of the other chain to the guanine in one chain
This ratio is called the Chargaff rule and according to which the number of four different nitrogen bases - nucleotides in DNA should always be equal and DNA
for nucleotides, the following pattern is performed:
In recent decades, the scientific search for the physical study of DNA macromolecules has been growing
Theoretical and experimental work has been accumulated to study the structure of nonlinear deviations of the genetic strain code
Based on these works, Yakushevich models of the model Inglender Peyrard-Bishop were formulated [12 3]
Inglender and co-authors began conducting theoretical studies of DNA kinks in 1980
They studied the dynamic features of open states of DNA and applied the single-soliton solution of the sine-Gordon equation as a mathematical method for studying such states
With the equality of all bases in the polynucleotide strand of DNA, the Inglander model provides a uniform state
The coefficients of the sine-Gordon equation for a given case
(z t) - characterizing angular deviations of pendulum from inequality
function I - moment of inertia V - constant of mutual interaction between pairs K '
- rotation hardness of sugar-phosphate chain a - distance between pairs
The study of dynamic processes in the DNA molecule, including nonlinear deviations in nodes, is one of the current problems
One of these speakers is oscillations around the sugar phosphate chain
When modeling these oscillations, a mechanical DNA analog and a mechanical Scott model are used [4]
DNA model
Pendulums located at the same distance from each other are represented in the form of a horizontal line
Pendulums can oscillate in the plane with an orthogonal inclined line
Pendulum is attached to spring packed in inclined axle
Scott's oscillation model can be explained using the sine-Gordon equation
where m - mass of pendulum P - length of rope thread g - gravitational
constant  - dissipation coefficient F0
characterizing constant
activities of the consolidated external forces
Analogues of pendulum loads in DNA reflect the connection between analogues of the axis of rotation of nitrogen bases - sugar-phosphate spinal gravitational potential - hydrogen action between pairs fixed by the second thread
This coincidence allowed Inglender and co-authors to solve the sine-Gordon equation of motion around the sugar-phosphate chain of DNA oscillations
Dissipation coefficient of the second equation and single-coliton solution in the form of kink (antikink) under the influence of external forces
Open states in the DNA zone are several pairs with a break in the hydrogen bond
This moves through open fields and molecules [1]

In this paper, consider studies of the dynamic characteristics of kinks and antiparticles in DNA
The single-soliton solution of equation (2) can be obtained by direct integration
Really looking for a solution to equation (2) in the form of a travelling wave
To do this, we make the following changes [4]:
As a result of these introductions, the specific derivative of the equation of equality (2) is transformed into the equation of the generalized differential

we write in the form of a full differential

taking into account the equal and (8) condition (7), the equation is written as follows:

When classified as Taylor

Since (z t) (17) equality is written as follows:

Conclusion
Quantitative calculations of analytical and dynamic characteristics for kink and antikink in DNA are made on the basis of a simple dynamic model of Yakushevich and Ryasik DNA macromolecules
Dissipation coefficient of these equations and single-soliton solution under external forces are obtained
All results obtained for simple DNA models

a) a deeper study of the section for electromagnetic phenomena; b) practical orientation and interest in the course study;
c) ability to work with electrical measuring devices and electrical installation devices;
d) familiarization with materials and fittings used in electrical engineering;
e) obtaining information on specialties of electrical orientation
It is advisable to use the following teaching methods to familiarize students with the new material:
verbal method of training: instructing conversational and advisory frontal tasks;
practical method of training - creation and assembly of electrical diagrams for creation of models of electrified devices, familiarization with technologies of repair of electrical devices and demonstration of methods and techniques of electrical installation works
Practical work should account for 70% of the total educational time and it is advisable to use the information educational resources of computer models of audiovisual fragments of animation performances in the training and research activities of students, and when issuing reports, significant attention should be paid to calculations for calculating the inductance of both simple fields produced using vector diagrams and capacities of devices with a simpler form.
To analyze the circuit diagram using simulation programs in laboratory works using a ballistic galvonometer, work can be organized to determine the intrinsic inductance of capacitance and inductance of linear and non-linear objects
The introductory part of the course will make a historical brief overview of the development and application of electrical engineering as an independent branch of science for the important role of electrical engineering in the industrial and innovative development of the country
At the same time, the level of production and energy consumption characterize the intensity of the productive forces of society
Electricity is a secondary type of energy that is absent in nature in the finished state
We cannot imagine a modern society without electricity
This is due to its important value, in particular its versatility, which is easily converted into other types of energy, such as mechanical thermochemical light, and the fact that it can be delivered over long distances
The basis for the development of electrical engineering will be the creation of a wide range of experimental studies and the theory of electricity and magnetism
Electrical engineering stood out from physics as an independent science at the end of the 19th century
Electrical engineering refers to technical science that studies the use of electrical and magnetic phenomena for practical application
During this period of time, it began to increase exponentially with open news
However, all of them are implemented on the basis of almost unchanged electrical engineering - theoretical, created in the first half of the XIX century
Currently, electrical engineering as a science includes such branches of science as lighting and power electronics, the theoretical foundations of electrical engineering and electromechanics
Electrical engineering is engaged in transforming the distribution of production as a branch of technology, as well as the creation of electronic components, electronic circuits and devices and technical systems
Currently, the field of electronics is separated from electrical engineering for converting and delivering information to integrated microelectronics [4; 5]
The first part of the program is devoted to the basic concepts and laws of the theory of the electromagnetic field, familiar to students from the course of physics, since, on the one hand, the study of this theory ensures the methodological integrity of the course under consideration, on the other hand, it is not enough to know only the theory of circuits when solving many issues of electrical engineering
When studying the section "Electrical circuits" we consider the basics of the theory of electrical circuits
The basis of the theory of electrical circuits is knowledge of the general concepts of the laws of electrical circuits, where circuits are reflected as generalized technical devices
Because electrical electronics are the most important electrical devices
It is emphasized that in these phenomena and processes, the main role is played by the electromagnetic field that make up the electric and magnetic fields
It
using DC delivery lines and
main values characterizing mundaproces E - strength D - electric field displacement
- current density B - magnetic induction H - magnetic field strength vectors also resemble medium parameters, such as magnetic permeability [6; 7]
Then parameters of C R L circuit and electrical circuits are analyzed.
It is envisaged that the AC current also takes into account inductance and capacitance, in the presence of two types of concentrated and branched (delivery lines) and, if necessary, take into account only the DC resistance
When studying capacitance, the potential characteristic of the electric field in the  of the Gauss theorem is taken into account, the mutual capacitance of a two-wire parallel line symmetrically located between each other two-wire line, which is important for electrical devices, with calculations
Similarly, resistance (and conductivity) is considered, in which the principle of current continuity at the potential of an electric field in a wire medium is considered, as an example, the ground resistance is calculated
After that, volt-ampere characteristics of linear and non-linear resistors are set
When considering inductance, the principle of continuity of the magnetic field resembles the expression of inductance for a circuit with isolated intrinsic induction with the calculation of a solenoid toroid
According to the theory of circuits, it is methodically advisable to divide the main material into two parts: DC circuits and AC circuits
When considering DC linear circuits, the laws of Om Joule-Lenz Kirghof are repeated, where special attention should be paid to the question of the positive direction of the current, since in accordance with the law of Om, the direction of the current to the resistance corresponds to the direction of the voltage
After a brief mention of the wide use of alternating periodic current in technology, the values ​ ​ of the law of sinusoidal change in the values ​ ​ of point values ​ ​ of voltage current frequencies used in various areas of electrical engineering are considered.
In a simple sinusoid ECD generator
- it is enough to consider a rectangular coil rotating in a uniform field
It is indicated that for AC circuits, the laws of Om Kirchhof Joule-Lenz are appropriate for voltage values ​ ​ obtained in one moment of current and power time
Circuits with capacitor of resistance coil are analyzed
Using the example of parallel circuits, paying attention to the issue of increasing the power factor using a capacitor, its technical and economic efficiency is indicated, the capacitance of the capacitor bank is calculated
Knowledge mastered by AC is used in the interpretation of AC generator
After that, it will be advisable to stop the construction and operation of the transformer
The example of a single-phase transformer indicates its action (voltage increase and decrease) and device
On the basis of calculation of parameters of non-linear circuits of resistors and current sources against current or voltage, their volt-ampere characteristic, given graphically or analytically, is accepted
In all circuit calculation methods (simple non-uniform bridge scheme of the Kirchhof equation, the method of contour currents of node voltages) should be considered and presented as examples of general type calculations necessary for practice
Students should be familiarized with the technical operation of methods of increasing the AC power factor
Current and voltage shifts in phases shall be taken into account when calculating the AC circuit
Therefore, it is advisable to start with schema analysis by determining the type of continuation of circuit elements by constructing a vector circuit diagram.
When studying electrical circuits, three interrelated factors can have an effective effect on the formation of electrical knowledge and student axis systems.
The first is the development of students' abilities to synthesize electrical knowledge on the analysis of electrical knowledge developed on the applied course, as well as the ability to use it on ordinary electrical devices
The second is the close connection of the content of educational material with the procedural side of training, corresponding to the structure of description of technical generalizing devices in the gnoseology of technical knowledge
Students when studying electrical circuits with separate elements of electrical circuits (current measuring devices switching devices, interference tanks, etc.
) practical familiarity with DC and AC models
Effective learning of electrical knowledge can lead to the formation of three systems in their minds that reflect the interconnection of knowledge about electrical circuits
Thus, the concepts of the properties of the laws of electrical circuits are one system, DC circuits are the second, and AC circuits are the third system
Readings (signals) during the study of the section of electrical measuring devices and the operation of electrical devices of various types
Indicates that the device state example is used to evaluate isolation
Electric measuring devices are characterized by high sensitivity and accuracy of measurements, reliability and simplicity of execution
Current voltage with frequency and capacitance of magnetic flux of electric energy
It should be noted that in addition to measurements, non-electric values can be measured using them.
Records the readings of electrical measuring devices at long distances using such controlled phenomena that can be used to directly affect production processes (automatic regulation), recording them on tape
The use of semiconductor technology today expands their use
It is advisable that the lessons constantly change the actions of students: to count the way vector diagrams inspect vector diagrams, build vector diagrams, build graphs, conduct a demonstration experiment
This will contribute to a conscious understanding of the material being studied
In general, the course will learn a common knowledge about physical processes on devices that are widespread in electrical systems, with consideration of functional designations of their structural parameters
Because the theory describing electrical equipment is a specific organizational form of technical education
It includes three levels of description of electrical devices: structural parameters of physical processes of functional purpose
Practical actions during the study of the applied course will be aimed at developing the creative activity of students
And this is a reliable initiative for school graduates who want to master technical specialties
In conclusion, we believe that familiarization of schoolchildren with the basics of electrical engineering should be among the urgent tasks of education, since electrical engineering is an important area of ​ ​ technology of the 21st century

The concepts "potential" "communicative potential" "communicative abilities" are provided in article
Pedagogical possibilities of forming the communicative potential of the future specialist by teaching a foreign language with determination of the need for proficiency in a foreign language are determined
Brief description of computer technologies used in teaching a foreign language, indicating the importance of the Internet in the development of language relations
Analyzed the possibilities of Internet resources in the process of training with description of social networks, based on obtaining a number of language knowledge, used in formation of communication potential of the future specialist
Keywords: potential communicative potential English language computer technology Internet social network
The prevailing market relations in modern society, the pace of development of science and technology, the introduction into production of new foreign technologies and methods put high demands on all stages of the organization of educational work
Everyone knows that modern information and communication technologies have introduced new and new ideas into the traditional teaching method, which has developed for many years
Before considering the possibilities of information and communication technologies in building the communication potential of the future specialist, first of all, briefly discuss the concepts of the potential of communication potential
The concept of "potential," based on the Latin word "potentia," is stated as a power ability that can manifest itself in hidden and certain conditions
In a special value, this is the degree to which an action or function can occur
Potential in a broader sense - a combination of factors used or capable of achieving the results of certain goals
"Capacity - preparing for the implementation of various types of actions by achieving predicted levels of personal development
Also, the personal potential constitutes the internal structure of a person, interpreted as a subject of special actions and abilities of a person as an individual "[1]
According to Lomova, we can name three main potentials that will allow an adult to achieve success and fulfill any actions: intellectual feat and communicative potential
Interpersonal values allow the exchange of information and actions and have a very high influence of communication potential in establishing contacts at a high professional level
The main components of the communicative potential can be called communicative properties and abilities
Communicative abilities - this is based on the skills and skills of language communication with people, being the guarantor of personal success
As a result of the analysis of various pedagogical and psychological studies, it is possible to determine the components of the communicative potential of the person (Figure 1)
An important role in reflecting the personal communicative potential of the future specialist is played by his personal communicative features
Figure 1
Components of the communicative potential of the individual
One of the main components of the communication potential of the future specialist is language training
The effectiveness of its communicative activities depends on the peculiarities of verbal development
The opportunity to attract the attention of the interlocutor and influence the mood and interest in any joint actions can serve as evidence of the influential language contact of the future specialist
The development of communicative potential at a high level leads to the formation of a communicative culture of the individual as a result
The choice and use of a communicative culture of personality - a means of linguistic communication - adekvata can also be considered as a set of knowledge and skills that ensure interpersonal purposeful and effective interaction, based on knowledge, ensuring the ability to competently select information during oral and written communication, predict the influence of opinions expressed on the interlocutor
So	row	communicative	cultural	it	shaping emotional culture as a collection of cognitive culture of speech
can be considered
Currently, teaching a foreign language in education has four goals: the communicative goal of cognitive education and improvement
Among the listed goals, the communication goal plays a leading role, the remaining three are implemented by fulfilling the communication goal
Several key factors that are mandatory for separation in teaching a foreign language in universities should be noted:
practical knowledge in lessons - integrity in solving the goals of education and development;
communicative orientation of the foreign language learning process;
selection of effective methods and ways of teaching each lesson;
The use of dialogue in the study of a foreign language as an organizational form, ensuring the active intervention of each student in classes;
- formation of good psychological situation between teacher and student and for mutual language communication of students
Currently, in the process of forming a communicative culture of the future specialist and preparing him for language relations at the professional level, the importance of information-skilled technologies prevails
New and new training methods are now available as the technical environment of this training
let's try to highlight several stages of development of computer technologies
Automated Computer Learning Technologies
Reading technology is outdated, but was the beginning for active use of the computer in study
Throughout the period of time, algorithms for studying and preparing computer training and control programs of various approaches were sufficiently sought
The emergence of personal computers had a significant impact on the formation and development of computer training technologies
Computer multimedia training technologies
In the future, a new multimedia training technology appeared with the expansion of the functionality of the computer, allowing the teacher to use various environments for the production of material
Networking Computer Training Technologies
A feature of the development of the modern educational period is the integrated use of various complementary educational technologies with developed tools for transmitting information with the possibility of working in an interactive mode
At this stage of the development of the world community in all spheres of its life, special attention is paid to network technologies of training and training
The development of technologies of network or, in other words, communication has given a new impetus to the development of Internet technologies of remote computer training [4]
It should be emphasized that the training technologies under consideration are based on the continuously evolving capabilities of the computer to provide and deliver information to distant imaginations
Currently, foreign language learning environments are installed on personal computers on information media or stored in high-availability telecommunications network funds
The Internet that appeared in the 21st century led to the development of a new and new direction
It is an electronic linguistics based on contact and distance learning of the language [5]
Scientists see the Internet as an environment in which they are able to actively search for information for those who are not "ready," but think on their own
As a result of research funded by the Google 2013 Internet Development Fund, the main directions and quantitative share of adult and adolescent actions on the Internet are defined in the table below (Table 1)
Main directions and quantitative share of actions of adults and adolescents on the Internet
Optimal use of information resources and Internet communication capabilities includes the process of teaching foreign languages:
- educational and teaching materials;
- optimal feedback of the teacher and education;
- Access to foreign and domestic information reference funds;
- Access to electronic libraries;
- access to funds of leading domestic and foreign print media;
- provides management information exchange within the training system
Foreign Language Training is training in the reception and transportation of information to language relations
When using the communicative capabilities of the Internet, students should be ready for specific communications in extracurricular times
Synchronous and asynchronous communications with the main types of communications of various types on the Internet
In building information and communication competencies in learning English, there is a communicative potential for e-mail, which carries out the transportation of address messages and file exchange through a computer network, which is a widespread type of communication on the Internet
It also allows you to significantly expand your knowledge as a means of communicating with email
The teacher-led English Language Forum is a tool, the main goal of organizing and conducting a specially organized independent student activity is to achieve the objectives of communication training, as well as discuss various issues that are not involved in study and learning
Synchronous communication consists in communication of two or more participants within the same period of time
A second may elapse between sending and receiving a message in this case
The use of the Internet in learning English is now relevant
Currently, the number of users of social networks is increasing every day
Social media aims to create a community of people with similar interests or actions on the Internet
Communication is via internal mail service or instant messaging
com - one of the most popular social networks
By replacing your account with English, you choose an effective way to remember often existing English-language messages and phrases
You also have the opportunity for those who learn English
- Multi-Language Learning Network
Training will be provided in game form
Asthma users registered
Provides paid and free services
- Popular American language social network

Information funds and networks are well organized
More than five hundred thousand users
From the site you can find more materials video audio text
- one of the social language networks with more than 700 thousand users from more than two hundred countries
In addition to training materials, you can use the services of a tutor on a paid basis
- video hosting, providing types of social services for the development of speech and listening
The Internet information system provides its users with many information resources
Skype, one of which allows you to communicate directly
The program offers financial and time-independent opportunities to learn foreign languages
Another positive achievement of the computer network is the activities of webinar sites
Webinar or online seminar
webinar - one of the types of online meetings and presentations on the Internet in real time
Online webinar service () will allow to conduct up to 200 participants of the discussion in real time
To conduct a webinar, it is enough to embed the e-mail addresses of registered participants, who, in turn, receive a link to a short explanation of the term of participation in your webinar.
You can also videoconference using a webcam
Web integration and participant analysis tools are also available
The "web-kest in education" technique that has recently appeared also has its own features
This will be organized in the form of a role-playing game with a problem task for solving using Internet information resources
A web quest is a set of pages combined with a hyperlink
Each page is part of one event
The connoisseur travels through the site, performing tasks
At the end, he forms the results as his report page

Also, Internet information funds control the ability to test knowledge in teaching lectures and grammar (grammar tests for reading lexical grammatical phonetic various exercises)
) allowed to be used
The Internet has a positive impact on the study of the social and psychological qualities of students: their confidence that they are able to work in a team, as an environment of an interactive approach
Use of the Internet for educational purposes: formation of an informative message based on the identified signs; ensure continuity of user relations with the information of the central information bank; by interest
"distributed" and allows the creative team to replicate (replicate) advanced pedagogical technologies while training several groups in different regions of the united country
In particular, the development of knowledge of professional proficiency in English by students using the Internet, the development of practical skills and skills, adaptation to research and development of the ability to increase readiness to use information technologies, in order to improve the communication potential of future specialists, it is necessary to carry out methodological work to update constantly updated education funds on the Internet

Has its own technological and social prerequisites for the emergence and distribution of the Internet
The first is the development of the scientific and technical base and the mass production of personal computers, the second is the intensity of information exchange of the public need to ensure national security
Internet and e-mail arrived in the Republic of Kazakhstan as a result of the partnership of the Russian Federation with Demos and the Kazakhstani cooperative Parasat
On April 7, 1991, company specialists installed a mail server to work at Parasat in Moscow
First message sent at 2400 kilobits per second
Addresses of all Internet information funds have a common sign certifying their location
We are talking about the abbreviation KZ on address sites
The name of the domain KZ was entered on September 19, 1994 in the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) database
The Internet gradually penetrates into every public institution in the organization of education even in our home
The number of Internet users is growing rapidly, and the share of young people among its users is very high
We can even say about the quality of tools that completely replace the information environment among young people
This is not surprising, because electronic libraries on the Internet - audio - video distribution funds - forums where virtual stores can freely express their opinions in discussion, etc.
you can use dozens of features
With the advent of new algorithms for connecting data that can be transported through the Internet, the sound quality has increased and approached the sound quality in ordinary telephone networks
Internet telephony technologies are actively developing
With special devices and software, you can organize audio and video conferences over the Internet
Information retrieval technology is used to effectively enable information retrieval on the Internet, with the aim of collecting data on global computer network information assets and enabling users to quickly search for information
Search engines allow you to search for multimedia files and document software on a global scale and address information about organizations and people
Currently in the scientific press and the media
The term "Internet space" is often used
Internet space is not only a collection of Internet resources (sources), but also a criterion with a developed infrastructure, transformed into an "infosphere" into an "information environment":
Internet technical and technological tools
human funds in the process of informatization
A system of relations in the community of specialists working on the basis of the Internet and new information technology tools
Over the past twenty years, with the spread of the Internet, there have been changes in the professional and household lives of tens of millions of people
The Internet provides users with tremendous opportunities to find and receive information and in the role of high communication technologies
Especially often, children feel free in cyberspace and quickly get information about emerging technologies
In the world network have gadgets of the latest models of various types, which feel like natural
the digital generation is growing
It is noted that the frequent use of the Internet contributes to the formation of moral standards for the development of the psyche of future generations
The list of links to ICQ e-mail, allowing people to exchange opinions and necessary data on the Internet, contains a wide range of services, such as chat
Text-based audio video exchange programmes are available to exchange views on time
To global information funds through the Internet (places of storage of documents in the database of electronic libraries, etc.
) access at any time
We can fully agree with the opinion expressed by Ben-Artzi (2003) "There is no sphere in which the Internet is not used"
In the last decade of the last century, the problem of health in the use of the Internet has become one of the most urgent for society
Goldberg (1996) proposed a group of diagnostic criteria for determining Internet dependence, based on the term "Internet addiction" and pathological signs of gambling addiction
He explains this as changes in behavior resulting from the use of the Internet and computer in the concept of dependence on the Internet
Kandell's 1998 added that the concept of "Internet dependence" will include any type of activity on the network
Currently, cases are explained when in the off-line mode as "Internet dependence" strive to access the Internet and not to leave the Internet on-line
In the field of informatization of education, specialized teachers, psychologists and sociologists often talk about the need to prevent the negative impact of the Internet
Various negative information (propaganda of nationalist violence; open recipes for the manufacture of imitation and explosives; advertising of parnographic products; sectarian mystical and esoteric teachings and practices and
With the advent of the Internet, users were able to quickly receive information from any zone of the globe
Popular computer gambling with elements of online cruelty among children and youth
They have also established remote user collaboration through personal computers
According to researchers in this industry, the possibility of uncontrolled access to the global network contributes to the realization of cruelty among children and youth
According to experts at the University of Hong Kong and published in the journals Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking, approximately 6% of the population around the world sounds the alarm about addiction to the Internet
They cannot control themselves when using the Internet
If you consider that only 39% of the population around the world have access to the Internet, this is a very high figure
Recently, a lot of information of aggressive and socially dangerous content has appeared on the Internet
It is important for users not only to explore the usefulness of using the Internet, but also to know that they must be able to protect themselves from possible threats from cyberspace
Given that young people and children are more active in owning modern technology, it is important for adults to realize the risks to their generation on the Internet.
Dependence on the Internet currently depends on the following factors:
the enormous amount of information in the Internet space and the ability to access it;
anonymity of the information transported and possibility of personal control of the transmitted information;
informed trust in communication
In real life, young people and children have many crisis situations with psychological influence of various levels
Young and child parents do not consider that such situations can occur in virtual life (Table 1) [4]
At the same time, the issue of ensuring information security is acute - protecting young people and children from entering private information funds from virtual life
As the main behavioral deviations in the Internet of cybersecurity, computer crimes of cyberterroism are called Internet addiction gamer and hacker [5]
The main signs of dependence on the Internet are:
Frequent email verification
do not take into account the time before the computer;
excessive network operation for any purpose;
Increased interest in information and technology; Table 1
Questions and Threats in Real and Virtual Space
emotional transmission in a virtual space;
priority of communication on-line as opposed to real mode;
Using the Internet as the main means of communication;
creation and operation of virtual images that are remote from specific characteristics;
a passion for malware [6]
Effects of Internet dependence:
complaints from families and friends against excessive prolonged online seating;
Inability to complete network communication on its own;
ignoring important cases and meetings that must be fulfilled in a timely manner by personal duties;
violation of the power supply mode;
the occurrence of fatigue and guilt when removed from the computer and the denial of Internet dependence;
The main possible directions for the provision of measures to prevent Internet dependence can be formulated as follows:
Monitor the work of children and young people on the Internet by age on the part of family teachers;
providing information on possible risks of Internet dependence;
blocking sites that disseminate socially dangerous information at the state level;
implementation of measures to improve information literacy (formation of a critical attitude to information received from the Internet)
Short-term courses aimed at preventing Internet dependence

This work includes training in the EU
It should be noted here that during the time of providing information, we must accompany two main things
They: informatization and economic system
Not only coordinated these two factors, but also considered them in terms of training methodology
Touched upon issues of general economic information processing
There are still issues waiting to be resolved
The use of key information management structures on specific structural economic issues in different formats is proposed, allowing students not only to carry out training tasks, but also to carry out training and training project work
Information Economic Data Processing System
Informatics as a science appeared as a result of focused research of information processes
The subject of informatics is the identification and study of information properties, legality of information processing, information processing management processes in artificial social and biological systems
Recently, another definition of the term informatics has appeared: informatics is the science of substantiation and application using computer technology to search for new knowledge in all areas of human action, explaining the meaning of the description of knowledge (perhaps in the future this definition will become the main one)
In the United States, computer science or computing (the last term is rare), and in Europe, computer science [1]
The issue we are considering is economic informatics
Therefore, let us recall the following concepts
One of them - economic information (EA) - began to be used in the 60s with the introduction of computer tools in the field of national economy management
His research, firstly, in relation to management services (planned forecasted normative structural and technological settlement financial and t) on participation in the process of processing/storing information (incoming consumption) at the place of origin (intermediate effective, stored without primary derivative processing)
) secondly, it allows to identify a number of features that contribute to the organization of automated processing:
In general, in the form of providing EA, special
It is initial and summary
to increase the reliability, which is necessarily reflected on material media in the form of documents, only legally formalized information is provided and processed, that is, if there is a signature in traditional or electronic documents (requires special means and organizational measures)
Thus, the size of the EA
Quality management of economic processes is impossible without complete information
Improved management in the material and intangible industries is led by an increase in the information flows accompanied by it (requires increased productivity of processing tools and communication channels)
Another of its properties is the cyclicity of EA
Most production and business processes are characterized by their periods and duplication of information reflecting these processes (programs created for processing information on the same day can be used and distributed many times)
EA shows the results of production and economic activity using a system of natural and value indicators
Numerical values of numerical values are also used (their convenient processing)
Special on EA processing methods
The processing process is dominated by arithmetic and, above all, logical (for example, sorting or selective) operations, and the results of text documents are presented in the form of diagrams and a graph (allowing you to limit yourself to a specific group of problematic software tools)
How complex an automated data processing system is and
"logical," but if the input does not accurately display the properties of the subject range, there is no benefit to its application
Unable to evaluate role and value of source information
Therefore, it is important for any economist to know the technology of working with primary information
It requires systemic information from economists
To register any business transaction, i.e. to obtain primary (primary) information about the processes going on at the control site, it is necessary to perform such actions as identification time, measurement
Recall that these actions were revealed
Identification is the process of an action that determines the identity of the object
Here, the labor subject (the executor of the operation) both the labor object (which fraction is processed) and the transfer object (or issued) the transfer subject (s) and others can be the object [2]
A combination of characters that map to an identity object and uniquely distinguish it from any other object (in a given information system within a given object class) is called an identifier
In other words, an identifier is a unique name for an object
The identifier can be both the digital code of the recipient and the signs of protection of the money sign
Depending on the specific circumstances, it is necessary to identify only the type of object (for example, the type of refrigerator, the cost of the banknote in the form of fabric), or the type of object (smarkard with its business list number)
Time Binding - The process that causes the time/date (start/end) of the activity to be set
Measurement is the determination of the value of a quantity by any size
The means and units of measurement methods (instances of kilograms of liters of rubles) depend significantly on the type of object measured
Here combines the fact that when they are accurately measured, primary data is generated [2]
The process of obtaining primary data has a number of features that must be taken into account when creating an automated information processing system
The most significant requirements to economic information: stability of usefulness efficiency of reliability of reliability sufficiency of stability [3]
Stability of information ensures uniform reception of it by all consumers
The value (or usefulness) of information is seen if it has contributed to the goal of consumers
The value of information is a relative property: the value of the same information is different for different consumers
Over time, the value of information will decrease - it will become obsolete
However, it should be borne in mind that the emergence of new information that provides a new combination of information that does not fully or partially perceive information that exists in a timely manner, with its clarification and addition.
Timeliness reflects the relevance of information for decision-making in cases of necessary calculations and changes
Accuracy determines the distortion limit of both source and output information, at which system performance is maintained
Reliability is determined by the property of reliable information to display objects with the required accuracy
The validity of the information is measured with a sure probability of the required accuracy, that is, with the probability that the value of the parameter indicating the information will not differ from the true value of this parameter within the required accuracy
The stability of the information shows its ability to respond to changes in the original data without compromising the necessary reliability
Information stability is determined by the selected method of its selection and generation
The sufficiency (completeness) of the information means that it contains the minimum necessary amount of information to make a correct decision.
Incomplete information (not enough to make the right decisions) reduces the effectiveness of consumer decisions
Redundancy usually reduces agility and makes decisions difficult, but makes information more stable
Structural components of EA
Economic indicators characterize both simple and complex
Each entity (object of a real process) has certain properties (cost of weight dimensions and t
a set of information reflecting an entity is called an information collection or a combined unit of information
Typically, information aggregate stepwise structure
For example, in Supplier Data, its A
Specify Address Item Item Supply Contract
Zip Code Address
"City" and
requires display [3]
The degree of refinement of the information set is final
Received the name informational consolidated props, not divided into semantic units
When describing information systems, its synonyms are used:
Details (documents) - a set of formal elements in a transaction or document, the absence of which deprives the transaction or document of legal force; mandatory data provided by the current rules or laws for documents, without which documents cannot be the basis for modern operations
Details (name of date amount) of economic information
) has no economic significance in case of its individual receipt, even if it is the main element [3]
Distinguishes between two types of details: props - mark and props - basis
If the props contain qualitative information properties (time or place of action, T performer
and t
), then it is called a prop - a sign
If the props represent a quantitative characteristic (volume of production in pieces, cost in rubles and t
) in it it is called props - the basis
Correction of the key figure for linking one props to one or more corresponding props
Indicator - a qualitatively determined value that gives a quantitative characteristic to the displayed object (substance, process) that has economic value
This is a minimum composition information set sufficient to form a personal message or form a document
For example, the information set "five pairs of women's boots" is of economic importance and therefore is an indicator consisting of the props "five" and three props "pair" "woman" and "boots"
Set of logically connected details has legal force
In general, data collection is a normal work process, and we must take into account that it does not require real qualifications and efforts and time
And costs are small because data collection is voluminous
In addition, the primary data should clearly describe the primary business transactions
In other words, the first information should be clear
But this is not enough
It should also be timely

This article provides opportunities and features for the dissemination of information on the Internet
Details of Internet quality assessment and basic information dissemination technologies studied
Analyzed web and corporate information portals
The main characteristics of corporate information portals in the network and their dependence on hardware and software aspects of functional content on the architecture structure are determined
Description of stages of information portal operation
The functional structure of the corporate information portal with indication of the methods of their creation was studied
Proven to be platform independent of enterprise portal
Information Technology, Enterprise Information Portal Metadata Repository Information Base
At present, due to the fact that society is informational, the importance of supporting global information processes becomes very large
A relevant issue is the study of methods and technologies to ensure its quality in the dissemination of information on the Internet
Information technology - 1) a process that uses a set of data processing methods and tools to obtain new information about the state of a process or an object phenomenon
2) a set of devices or methods of elements of technology used to process information
A general concept that includes methods and mechanisms for transmitting information and their combined devices
Thus, the concept of information technology is a collection of elements of devices of methods for delivering processed accumulated information to a user in accumulated form
That is, the technology of summary transfer of information to us [1]
The State programme "Information Kazakhstan 2020" adopted in 2012 with regard to information on the Internet contains the following plans:
To bring the provision of the version of print and electronic media on the Internet by 2017 to 70% by 2020 - 95%
media accessible through mobile applications, bringing to 80% by 2017 - 50% by 2020 [2];
This plan shows the relevance of attention to the quality of information on the Internet with an increase in its volume
The quality of information on the Internet is assessed at different levels
First of all, the quality of information will depend on the responsibility of Internet users themselves
Information on the Internet can be found in qualitatively selected special thematic catalogs (- thematic catalogs in the virtual library and other information centers)
The negative aspects of such catalogs are the relatively small amount of information resources and the large amount of misinformation
Therefore, information on the Internet in most cases
have to access search and robotic systems
Search Robots	search	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	found	information	in its own way	trying to evaluate
They assess the information by two indicators:
content of the website
external indicators of the site
The content of the website is assessed according to the following indicators:
Number of words on the sheet
at the location of the wanted word within the document;
depending on which sheet the word is found on;
Structure and composition of the technical indicators web page
External indicators of the website include:
the frequency at which other sites link to the same site;
frequency of login to the site;
site users (availability of specific and regular users);
availability of competitive partners - the advantage of the site from them;
Web Page Placement Fee
The search engine systematizes information on its rating with an estimate of these indicators
Results may differ from each other due to different operation of each search engine
One of the mechanisms to increase the efficiency of the use of information technologies in government bodies is the introduction of a new model of informatization, based on the transition to the use of ICT outsourcing "cloud settlement" and consolidation of orders
Server virtualization technologies and cloud computing models based on data centers are now widely used in global practice
The result of this technology is the efficiency of the business processes of government bodies to consolidate and save budget funds
Introduction of "virtualization" of servers and "cloud computing" technologies in public sector started in Kazakhstan today
In 2010, a government server center was commissioned, on the basis of which since 2011 a consolidated computing platform has been opened using virtualization technology to centrally provide computing resources provided by collocation services (rental of a pole-seat for server equipment)
Based on Cloud Computing
Implementation of the project "Unified postal system of state bodies of the Republic of Kazakhstan" and the creation of a data processing center in Pavlodar [2]
The main means of disseminating information include the Web
When applied, the following possibilities are achieved:
increased ability to view information and increased number of users working with it;
provides a convenient interface for search and navigation;
It is allowed to work with various information located in different sources (internal and outside the institution);
reduced requirements for hardware and software equipment due to thin consumer technology and reduced costs for supporting the consumer's place;
Without the possibility of application independently of the software platform (Java) and the data display system (XML);
information for employees, partners and customers can be distributed via Intranet/Extranet and the Internet
This will increase the space for communication with information
As a result, information sent by the user is distributed through an application that uses two main technologies:
Web-focused tools, Business Intelligence, and Web analytics applications;
Enterprise Information Portal and Mailing List Servers
These technologies are interchangeable: in order to achieve maximum efficiency, they should be applied together
Web-based BI Tools and Analysis Packages disseminate information and results of analysis methods performed through standard graphics and Web interfaces
Most of these products leverage basic networking capabilities to support scheduled and managed events in the delivery of information with the Web server and mail systems
Due to the increased flow of information, the likelihood of their distribution within the information store located on various servers increases
This question arises especially when organizations receive information from external sources from the internal registrar from the collective software used on the Web server
A second enterprise information portal technology is used to provide users with access to a wide range of information (unlimited and offline)
Site metadata and retrieval methods are used to publish corporate information to the portal
When the employee provides the necessary request, selects the necessary information using the means of building and delivering metadata corresponding to the portal
If the information is shared correctly, the work is carried out efficiently, otherwise workers cannot re-come to each other's common standard of services
Thus, corporate information portals are a guaranteed free basis for information exchange
Enterprise Collaboration Portal (ECP) is a portal that enables employees to work together to solve a specific problem or work on a project and allows them to use the necessary information and applications for their organization.
Learn more about the capabilities and features of these enterprise information portals
The creation of information portals on the Internet is carried out by a group of commercial sites - "Information Drives" (Yahoo AltaVista Lycos and
) with the release time 1994-1995.
can be linked
For the first time, the Enterprise Information Portal (EIP) directory was presented by Christopher Shylax and Julia Tilman as follows:
"Enterprise Information Portal is an application that allows institutions to use information stored inside and outside the organization and provides each user with a unique point of access to relevant information designed to make informed management decisions"
In this case, the enterprise information portal can contain the following elements:
search and grouping of information by indexing systems;
user relationship systems;
content management systems;
document management systems;
Business Process Management Systems (workflow)
User Environment Configuration Systems
information security systems;
one-time recording systems;
unification systems [3]
The operation of the information portal can be divided into several stages:
The portal receives information from various sources
Portal provides initial recognition and access to information
When using management systems, metadata is generated
Metadata	user	appointed	"from filter"	passes		unnecessary information will be deleted
The sorted information is then sent to the user
User
can adjust the "filter" at his own discretion (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Diagram of information portal operation
Enterprise Information Portal is divided into two sections:
Internal	portal	(Intranet)	users	limited	quantity	the part containing the informal information intended for application; The LAN will be used
The section for public use, which contains information for the public, uses the Internet (Figure 2)
Figure 2
Enterprise Portal Organization Diagram
The functional structure of the enterprise information portal can be classified into the following components:
Input tools and organization of incoming information
Not enough information in Enterprise Portal database
It is necessary to enter so that the user can receive the necessary information completely and conveniently.
Information storage systems allow you to place all information in a single "heap" only by OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing Online Transaction Processing)
For example, the user writes the order in the portal window and gets a list of all relevant documents
To select from this list, it will have to work for a long time
Yandex Rambler t on the Internet
such systems operate on this principle
In structural implementation and information storage, inbound data is assigned a specific degree or category
They are enshrined in the classification system adopted by the institution
In this case, you can easily find information by OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing or Real-Time Data Analysis) even without providing search queries on the directory accepted in the institution (one-time and multidimensional)
Quintura, which collects information on the Internet in the category
Search engines, such as ru, have also been put into operation
Particular attention should be paid to the organization of the implementation of incoming information, since it is obvious that the quality of information supplied to the end user directly depends on this.
It is virtually impossible to restore or improve the quality of information if it was originally included in one "heap"
You can only correct the situation if you enter the information in full
Reliable Information Storage
Reliability of information storage is determined by the following factors:
the database used;
information access restriction systems;
protection against the creation of unauthorized messages [4]
Most often, enterprise portals use well-established MSSQL Server or Oracle databases
Special attention will be paid to limiting access to information
Each user has a separate menu that can view only the information provided to him for viewing
All user actions are documented in the portal
Data Discovery Tools
There are several types of data detection and processing related to the requirements for the organization of work and stored information:
multi-dimensional data transfer is the most convenient fast and efficient way
full text search systems from sample search to morphology based search
OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing)
Applications
The user tool in the portal system will have a browser or navigator that allows you to create a directory on the sheet in the desired format
Many portals (for example, Hummingbird Communications EIP) allow the user to configure the source page or a separate Web page at their discretion (data filtering mechanism)
Security systems
As a rule, the assignment of a cryptographic coding password is the property of the electronic digital signature identifier;
standard protective measures such as [5]
Knowledge Management or mining applications that provide a convenient mechanism for building access to unrecorded data structuring categories (for example, lost in a mailbox)
Testing documents that have the principles of their work is aimed at placing metadata on these critical reviews in the information repository in parallel with the reference to the original document
This will set the category that includes the time when the language header with the document text was created
Names that occur simultaneously in the document
terms from other attributes create special dictionaries or databases, including their sources
The result of the action is the classification of text documents into categories related to the use of heuristic analysis tools depending on their semantic and terminological proximity
Repository refers to working groups of users of information objects, etc.
approves the metadata storage
Metadata displays the format of an object type partition, even content
The internal publishing and subscription system allows users to publish their documents and record to obtain the necessary information from external sources
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
Business process planning and analysis mechanisms inclusive
ERP systems can be called a collection of integrated applications that support the main aspects of the management of an institution in a single information space
These include the analysis and accounting of the economic performance of the production plan for planning the resources of goods and services for the enterprise.
All planning and analytical activities in the ERP system are divided into separate functional modules
CRM - Customer Relationship Management (can log on to ERP) merges front and back-office to adapt the portal to consumer requirements, allowing you to build a consumer information base
At this time, the institution can not only significantly increase the potential of the front office, but also conduct a study of what customers think
In conclusion, the enterprise portal will work on a computer on which any operating system is installed, even on mobile phones
The only requirement
- Enough to create an Internet contact
Tools independent of the unified information release platform at the request of information users
Solving this problem does not require almost no work from the compilers of the corporate portal
Enterprise Portal is a platform-independent solution to define

The development of functional literacy of students in the article is considered as an integral part of the professional competence of the future teacher
Methodological approaches necessary for the development of functional literacy are proposed
In preparing future teachers for the development of functional literacy of students on the basis of information systems, technological approaches to learning are applied
Based on the basic theoretical rules and structures for the formation of functional literacy
Features of functional chapel development will be noted
Methodological approaches to the development of functional literacy of students in the competencies of professional training of future teachers
Socioeconomic and political changes taking place in society today
growing integration processes strengthen requirements for university graduates, increase competition in the labor market
Therefore, in universities there is an increasing need to train specialists with competent and healthy professional competent functional competent information culture who have mastered knowledge and science in accordance with the requirements of the time
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
In Nazarbayev's message "Strategy Қazaқstan-2050" is a new political course of the state ":" Our youth must skillfully and effectively use knowledge and technology in everyday life, acquiring new skills in learning new sciences and knowledge for learning "
We must do everything possible for this and ensure the most favorable conditions, "he said [1].
The State Programme for the Development of Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020 sets out the task of developing human capital by improving the quality of education for the sustainable development of the economy [2]
In the context of the information development of society, there is a gap between the level of use of ready-made technologies and the level of their creation, which calls into question the impossibility of slowing down the training of highly qualified specialists through education
In this regard, universities pay special attention to the formation of professional technological competencies of the future teacher
Modern information technologies used in the educational process are based on the use of computers
Computer locks have great computational capabilities for processing and displaying formalized knowledge and create conditions for creating and using more advanced forms of educational organization in training
However, according to our definition, the need to improve training in methods of formalizing the knowledge of the educational process of universities is determined
This requires training students to create them along with the effective use of modern information technologies in the professional activities of the future
Therefore, the capabilities of computers in the training of specialists in modern teaching methods are not fully used, which, in turn, leads to contradictions between the then established teaching methods and technologies with the achieved level of development of information technologies
To resolve this conflict, it will be necessary to create new innovative educational technologies aimed at solving independent educational problems, deeply thought out from pedagogical science and teaching theory
In the history of mankind, the main issue is the development of a person who creates social experience, and not only tools for carrying out activities
Human Development Index (ADI) indicator comparing States with their life expectancy, taking into account factors such as health education, income generation and working conditions
Based on them, international comparisons will be made and the achievements of States in this field will be determined
Of particular importance in the formation of man as a social person is his natural ability to develop and independent activity
In this regard, when preparing a university aimed at forming a new thinking specialist
increasing the relevance of the new paradigm based on "own philosophy"
phenomenon
The conclusions and conclusions presented in them, considering the issues of functional literacy of the future specialist from a philosophical psychological pedagogical point of view, serve as methodological activity in our study
In philosophical research, self-development is considered from the point of view of human improvement, in psychological research, personality activity is studied from the point of view of action theory, and pedagogical analyses are discussed from the point of view of professional development of the future specialist
According to Bodalev, the need and ability of a person to self-develop is easily and quickly realized if there are qualitative changes in personality when achieving certain goals
Secondly, a person can develop new qualities for himself in the process of hard work, striving for conscious action of a certain orientation
At the same time, the desire to engage in certain activities is an indicator of the need and readiness for self-realization [3]
We believe that this also concerns the functional literacy of the future teacher, which we are discussing in full
These opinions on the characteristic characteristics of the concept of "Development of functional literacy": firstly, this is a pedagogical psychological socio-physiological philosophical personality
Secondly, these trends are mostly creative, which suggests that they have quantitative and qualitative criteria, full of contradictions, covering all fields of personality.
The importance of developing functional literacy, in our opinion, is
in relation to the concepts of "development" and "self-realization"
In the "psychological" dictionary, "development" turns into qualitative changes that go beyond a certain criterion, and the concept of "personal development" is interpreted as a tendency to form the personality as a social property as a result of socialization and personality education [4]
The abilities and services that emerge from this trend reproduce the historical human qualities of the individual
"Lady" - update process
In accordance with the meaning of "disappearance of the life of the soul"
Therefore, the emergence and development of the soul directly depends
Like all natural phenomena, the product of nature changes with dialect development with a transition from one level to another
All types of development - movement, but not all movements have the same development
Development of an irreversible movement that provides only qualitative changes [5]
Three types of development are considered in philosophical literature: progressive regressive and development on the same plane
Progressive development - the process of updating the movement from simple to complex from outdated quality to new
Elevating this developing system to a higher level
The upper level is rich in complex mature content compared to the lower
Another undisputed high-level criterion is within the same level
The complexity of the development process and the presence of phenomena in the form of a spiral make it possible to consider the improvement of the creative potential of a teacher as a self-prepared tendency to move it forward and correspond to the concept of "self-realization" - "development of functional literacy"
External effects play an intermediate role in spontaneous promotion
Facial functionality
literacy differs from self-realization in quality and is accompanied by the transition of the organization to a high level
Personal development is carried out in activities led by a system of motivation inherent in a given individual
Here, changes expressed in qualitative and quantitative results are taken as a sign of development
Usually changes include different personality fields
However, for each individual, the presence of these changes is individual by activation
Development and self-realization enrich each other, being the sources of each other
Self-development creates better or worse prerequisites for further development under the influence of learning and education, dancing individuals and reaching a certain level of their results
As you know, if learning and education are significantly ahead of development and are in the closest direction of development, their development will have a result
The conclusion is that self-realization is that non-competitive qualitative changes in a physical person occur due to his will, and the individual himself is responsible for his development
But this does not happen immediately, but at a certain stage of personal development.
The phrase "I myself" familiar to everyone is the beginning of self-realization
But it takes some time for the need for self-realization to become a sustainable personality [6]
At the initial stages of the formation of an individual, his activity is manifested in the form of preparation for the reception of professional skills in the process of communication
But in the future, this training undergoes changes associated with the pace of development of one's own personality consciousness, which can independently regulate its behavior
The process of developing functional literacy can arise under the feet, even when an individual does not set such a task
This is a necessary stage of the process, as it was prepared by the trend of personality development
Developing Functional Literacy - Changing the Inner World of Man
This is due to the definition of a person's personality in the process of his existence and an understanding of his essence
It is influenced by external factors such as learning and other cognitive actions
A condition for the graduation of professional specialists is the focus of secondary special education on professional competence to create its own basis on the basis of knowledge, as actions with independent responsibility
Through the development of functional literacy, the individual exercises his abilities and improves his mental qualities, as a result of which he contributes to the cultural and historical development of society, contributing to a self-realizing community
Therefore, in solving the socio-economic problems of modern society, the self-development of the personality of a young specialist is of great importance
In the context of the development of professional competence of graduates of pedagogical universities, the task of forming and constantly improving the abilities for training and independent work always remains relevant
It is known that the process of personality formation is carried out in various social relations surrounding it
No matter how society defines these rules of formation, it is important that individual self-regulation of self-expression matters
And self-realization is a development that occurs thanks to the internal activity of the person
Functional literacy characterizes the ability to solve vital standard reports in various areas of activity based on applied knowledge
Real issues should cover all the main areas of modern social practice (education and recreation with various social institutions and the public with nature and social environment)
interaction with associations)
According to a number of researchers, the visibility zone of functional literacy is all types of actions in which the individual participates in everyday life
They are communicative transformative (substantive practical) artistic game actions focused on educational and cognitive values
Nazarovo	[7]	future	teachers	functional	the following components are distinguished in the literacy structure:
Cognitive component (applied knowledge);
Functional component (subject reproductive and productive-creative skills);
Personal component (qualitative personality characteristics);
Vocational and pedagogical component (vocational and pedagogical skills)
Axiological and integrative approaches of systemic personality-oriented competence are chosen as methodological orientation in the development of functional literacy of future teachers
Functional literacy is formed in the process of educational and cognitive activity, the result of which is educational and cognitive means - subject and general knowledge and skills
At the same time, general knowledge and skills (informational intellectual organizational communication) are mastered, which determine the meaningful and necessary motivational components of functional literacy
Thus, we can say that every person (person), regardless of the sphere of activity that devotes his life, is capable of full adaptation in the conditions of everyday life in the environment, awaits his comfortable (good) life
Proposed in the country [876b
], a monographic study examines the theoretical foundations of the formation of functional literacy of a social subject
In theory and practice, the meaning of the concept of "functional literacy" is revealed, along with which functional literacy is characterized as a socio-pedagogical issue and as components of the structure of functional literacy of a teacher with an analysis of the levels of personality visibility in various scales of life actions: motivational cognitive actions and reflexive components are determined
Indicators of criteria for the formation of a methodology for the development of functional literacy of a teacher and pedagogical conditions for its development, as well as the influence of information culture in the information society on the functional literacy of a teacher will also be based
The main methodological approaches necessary for the development of teacher literacy are proposed [8 80 b
A systematic approach allows you to explore the development of functional literacy of a teacher as a system consisting of a set of component elements;
characterized by an understanding of the development of functional literacy of a convenient teacher, oriented towards the person, as the conditions for his personal development and the definition of the individual creative nature of actions
competence is related to the fact that this considers the development of functional literacy of a teacher as a process of developing the competencies necessary to become a literate person;
The axiological approach makes it possible to provide for the formation of value guidelines for the development of functional literacy of this teacher;
offers integration of all elements of functional literacy of an integrative teacher
In preparing future teachers for the development of functional literacy of students based on information systems, we follow technological approaches
Because technological adaptation provides an opportunity to instrumentally accurately control the learning process and guarantees the achievement of the set goals, since the technologically convenient socio-pedagogical process opens up new opportunities for conceptual and design development, that is, technologically convenient:
Managing and forecasting a large-scale pedagogical process;
reducing the impact of negative human conditions;
rational use of available resources;
enables the selection of negative effects and the creation of new technologies and models for solving emerging socio-pedagogical problems [8172]
In particular, based on the writings of [789], we have seen that the preparation of future teachers for the development of functional literacy of students based on information systems should be considered through the following approaches.
Functional and technological reflexive-oriented actions of system resource competence
Based on the basic theoretical principles and structures of the formation of functional sauteness, we can distinguish the features of the development of functional sauteness:
Defining the type of functional clock
selecting a base object in which a functional clock is formed;
replenishment of functional clock content;
Distinguish between sections of curriculum headings
textbooks, tutorials and
selection of training materials;
determining the most rational approaches for the development of this selected type of functional chapel;
assessment of functional completeness of knowledge based on criteria of selected indicators;
analytical map and t, which determine formation of personal qualities of control diary of self-assessment questionnaire of personal achievements of knowledge
evaluation with
It became known that by preparing future teachers for the development of functional literacy of students on the basis of information systems, ideas will be obtained on choosing mutually exclusive values ​ ​ and their orientation to promote self-development of the individual

Analysis of the semantic field of informatization of education, changing the structure of educational and information interaction between participants in the educational process; changing the form of provision of educational content, including educational material and educational and methodological support; allows you to determine the transformation of informatization of the educational environment
Changed social conditions raise new issues before the education system, the model of formation of professional competence of a specialist in society is changing
Experience in the use of information technologies in different countries shows that educational institutions based on them
increase motivation on the basis of game conditions for the possibility of self-selection of forms and methods of training for managing the conditions of readable objects of computer visualization of phenomena;
self-selection and differentiation of the training regime and organizational forms of the educational process through the possibility of interactive dialogue;
Train the student in structuring equipment and modelling research on the phenomenon in the world;
To expand the student's activities in self-knowledge due to the possibility of organizing various types of educational activities;
Building student recognition by leveraging artificial intelligence;
formation of information competence and information culture;
to form an individual educational trajectory taking into account the needs of the individual;
contributes to the social demand of society for the formation of an active educated person who is able to live actively in an ever-changing world
Informatization of education in combination with e-portfolio technology should be considered as a process of intellectualization of the activities of the student and student (teacher and student), developing on the basis of realizing the capabilities of the new information technology environment, and where the subject area and environment (social environmental information, etc.
) supports the integration trend of the process of recognition of legality
e-portfolio technology considers the benefits of individualization and differentiation of training to be correct
Thus, it will provide students with a comprehensive pedagogical impact and guaranteed achievement of the results of competently expressed education
The portfolio is actively used in the foreign education system and in the educational process various types are created and used
Traditionally, a portfolio is understood as a way of fixing certain works to one fund
Portfolio training occurs in various areas of activity, such as social creativity and professional activity
The goal of the portfolio is to plan various activities as a single system to further reflect the results of potential customers
Portfolio is a tool for determining or maintaining the level of development of the performer as a specialist
A portfolio in relation to education (in the broad sense of the word) is a technology for summarizing and evaluating the individual achievements of students over a specific training period
The purpose of the portfolio is a report reflecting a holistic picture of the significant result of education by the learning process, reflecting the established degree of its competence and assessing the result of educational activities of students
The portfolio in the post-government space was used mainly to assess the performance of a student in some cases
There are also portfolios of structural divisions of institutions.
In educational processes in universities, an electronic type of portfolio began to be used
The portfolio is widely used in European countries and the USA as a method and tool for assessing educational activities and their results
This is due to the fact that specialists of professional services in this country traditionally actively use the portfolio to demonstrate the achievements of professional competence
A number of foreign researchers (for example, Sherry A
and t
) in order to optimize this process, "Portfolio" proposes to divide the content into several components in accordance with the types of activities (Table 1)
Compilers of the Portfolio
Competency in education offers new methods for assessing the level of competence
The portfolio is a tool for unambiguous assessment of a student's level, formed near professional activity in conditions that can implement a contextual approach to the development of his competence and in the process of training
Waters noted that the e-portfolio is not only a collection of results and organization of student learning and their professional opportunities, but also a strong motivation factor for the student and teacher
He also stressed that the e-portfolio was created to systematize in order to show the result of students to put skills in the first place
The portfolio includes various types of files (audio video graphics text), samples of works performed by exhibits, evaluation plans of summary lessons and individual reflections
The e-portfolio allows you to accumulate a large number of students' materials, and then distribute these materials to the student society and use them again as a textbook
According to the definition of Educause's National Learning Infrastructure Initiative, the authors understand the portfolio as a set of materials prepared to achieve a special rhetorical goal for one or more "viewers"
The portfolio allows you to change the ways and means of monitoring and evaluating results, providing you with a reflection of the flexibility of the qualitative criterion for assessing continuity of systems
Existing approaches to the portfolio structure are combined with the general activities of students, supplemented by materials, maintain competence (collection of artifacts) and reflection
An important characteristic feature of the portfolio is the systematization and consolidation of all the results of the student's educational activities
Portfolio includes independent (professional and personal) results of educational process
e-portfolio technology combines and uses various components of information and educational resources for the formation of professional competencies
Their classification is given in Table 2
Classification of information and educational resources
The E-portfolio structure is closely linked to clear and fuzzy links that have different electronic resources and allow the use of available resources to form a whole competency goal
Different roles of the portfolio in the educational process imply different formats/forms of the portfolio structure
Thus, e-portfolio technology can be considered as a way to build an open education system that allows each student to choose the trajectory and technology of their training based on available resources
A benchmarking study involving applications such as e-portfolios identified several issues that have arisen in higher education, such as the use of ICT in European Russian and Kazakh universities:
The lack of readiness of significant teachers to actively use information technologies in the educational process;
active development of an alternative to feeding the knowledge of mass open online courses;
insufficient preparation of the methodology for the application of interactive communication technologies in the university;
lack of flexibility of verbal communications of students in the post-Soviet space, due, inter alia, to the introduction of mass testing
Priority of virtualization in the trainee's activities
Different levels of readiness for the introduction of information technologies in educational institutions;
Insufficient corporate networks in educational systems and resource centres;
a virtual tool is not a means of expression, but an individual marketing tool
Thus, the process of using ICT in the educational process has changed, moving from a one-time fact to a regular application
Modern education not only uses ICT, but is also organized through new forms of education

The article provides for the use of the project method in the process of training future informatics teachers
Possibilities and practical significance of using the design method are given.
The main conditions for using this method differ
Project milestones reviewed
Use of the project method of teaching special disciplines among students of 2 and 3 courses of this specialty
examples and results are given
Personal-oriented learning technology, pedagogical process, process of professional training of pedagogical technology, technology of design methods design
The main goal of vocational education is the training of qualified specialists with high responsibility in the labor market who have developed competencies that meet the requirements of competitive time
The use of pedagogical methods that allow rapid adaptation to the changing conditions of the modern information society is one of the priority areas of pedagogical theory and practice
In view of the fact that the modern education system is oriented towards individually oriented technologies, one such method is the project method based on integration with information and communication technologies
It will ensure high motivation of students to develop new knowledge, increase the sense of responsibility for working with group actions
Individual orientation of the pedagogical process In each individual, an important condition of education today is the creation of an individually oriented development system in the search for abilities embedded in its nature
Modern pedagogical technologies consider important teaching methods aimed at revealing the competencies of students depending on their flexibility and interests
One such training method is the project method
Design method is not considered new in world practice
He appeared in the United States at the beginning of the last century
He called it a problematic method and called the American philosopher teacher J.
Dewey's philosophy is related to the ideas of humanism in education
The design method attracted the attention of many teachers at the beginning of the 20th century
Under the leadership of Shatsky, a group of small workers was organized who seek to actively use the project method in educational practice
In the US in the UK in Belgium in Finland in Germany in Italy and many other countries
In countries where Dewey used the idea of ​ ​ a humane approach to education, the project method was widely known
The main thesis of the modern understanding of the design method: "I know that I know what I need, where and for what I use this knowledge" brings many educational systems closer to themselves, striving for a conscious balance between academic knowledge and pragmatic skills [1]
The project is a collection of texts of documents of certain actions to create a true object necessary for creating articulated theoretical products, and all the time is a creative activity
In school education, the project method is considered as any alternative to the class system
A modern student project that meets the requirements of time is a didactic tool for activating cognitive activity, developing creativity and simultaneously forming personal qualities
The project method is a pedagogical technology aimed at applying new knowledge, and not at integrating real knowledge
Active mobilization of students to create any projects to teach them to learn new ways of human activity in the socio-cultural environment
In the design method as a pedagogical technology, the American teacher philosopher J.
There is a set of ideas proposed by Dewey
He formulates the principle: "the youth of a child is a full life, and not the period of preparation for her future life.
All actions, including training, should be tailored to the needs of their interests in their personal experience "
The project method is based on the development of students' ability to independently navigate the information space of cognitive creative skills
The project method always focuses on students' own actions: an independent pair group performs this in a certain period of time for students
This approach is well combined with a group approach to learning
The project method often suggests solving any issues involving the use of different methods, on the other hand, it is based on the use of integrated knowledge from various branches of science
Work on the project method is not limited to the presence of a question and its understanding, while the solution to its disclosure includes a clear distribution of roles for the presence of a thought or hypothesis that provides a solution to the problem of planning specific actions (the presence of tasks for each participant and they should be closely related)
The results of the completed projects should be substantive, i.e. in the presence of a theoretical problem should have a clear solution, which should be ready to apply the actual practical result, if it is practical [2]
The ability to use the project method is an indicator of the high qualification of the teacher of his progressive training methodology
This technology is attributed to the technology of the 21st century, which includes the ability of a person to quickly adapt to changing conditions in the information society
Let us highlight several basic requirements for the operation of the design method
Research The presence of a creative problem or report
Such a significant question requires research to address integrated knowledge
For example, the creation of a series of events in different regions of the world that solve a common problem that opens up a certain topic of research on the demographic problem; addressing the environmental problem and
Theoretical practical cognitive significance of predicted results
For example, publishing newspapers that raise a general issue, displaying processes from the scene, etc.
Students' own actions (independent pair group)
Structure the content of the project (with periodic results)
Use research methods, identify the issue and identify the tasks needed to solve it.
) use of methods [1]
Different project topics for different situations
In some cases, the topic may be formulated with the assistance of education professionals within the framework of the approved programme
Sometimes, according to the instructions of the teacher, depending on the conditions of study, within a certain subject can be chosen taking into account the natural professional interests and abilities of students
In the third case, the subjects of the project can be presented by students independently, depending on their individual abilities for cognitive and creative applied interests, and t.
maybe
The theme of the project may be to differentiate the process of teaching theoretical issues of the school curriculum in order to deepen the knowledge obtained from individual disciplines
The results of the completed projects should be material, which should be drawn up at the required level, for example, a video album computer newspaper almons, etc.
maybe
In solving the project problem, students will have to use the knowledge and skills gained in each industry
For example
physical chemistry mathematics and t
languages
The personal orientation of the pedagogical process cannot be carried out without changing educational technologies, creating an individually oriented pedagogical system, developing the abilities of each individual meets today's educational requirements
Educational technologies should ensure the disclosure of the student's subjective experience, the formation of educational methods that are personally significant for the student, the self-mastering of educational skills
They provide an effective approach to learning, allowing for the high task of moving students into their own development mode, combining with the considered information technologies and information environments of the modern school
Dewey sees the project method as a universal method of school practice
He considers this method to be complementary to the organization of students' self-work in developed information environments, and not as a method that replaces the existing system
His role in organizing the student's education becomes even more significant, as he organizes the educational process aimed at independent education: in an environment where the student is analyzed in detail and rationally organized, he chooses his educational trajectory
Forms its forecast on the principles of cooperation, creatively interacting with students who will work together with the team
At the same time, in its educational research activities, the skill of using the acquired knowledge in action is formed with the comprehensive development of the Menen personality in a specific activity, determining the formation of the knowledge of subjectivity
This will increase the status of the subject in the educational process for the development of the student himself
Providing training in this form will increase the effectiveness of training
It will provide a system of effective feedback, in turn, will ensure not only the self-realization of the development of individual education of students, but also increase the activity of teachers participating in the project
They are opening up new opportunities to create a unified system of requirements for ensuring the optimal educational process for further deepening interdisciplinary cooperation in improving professional skills for understanding their own experience
All this suggests that the moment has come to talk about creating the foundations of project training
Chernigova considers project training as developing training based on the consistent implementation of complex educational projects for the development of theoretical knowledge
This help shows that project training is a developmental learning type
Let's try to analyze the actions related to the design technology
Purpose of training:
To obtain the necessary knowledge independently and at will from various fields of education;
Learn how to use previously acquired knowledge to produce informative and practical reports;
developing communication skills, working with different groups;
development of research skills (synthesis of the analytical hypothesis of conducting an experiment to collect information with the ability to solve the problem);
creating conditions for students developing systemic thinking
The first theoretical principles of project training:
the focus is on the influence of the student on the development of his creative abilities;
the educational process is not formed according to the logic of the educational subject, but to the logic of actions of personal importance to the student, which increases his motivation in teaching;
The independent pace of students in the process of working on the project ensures the functioning of each student in terms of his level of development;
an integrated approach to the creation of educational projects ensures the balanced development of the basic physiological and mental functions of students;
deep meaningful learning is achieved through its use in different settings
Thus, the essence of project training is that the student in the process of working on the project understands the essence of real processes and objects
It will allow you to create new objects so that students can learn real conditions, understand their essence
To create knowledge to study a new phenomenon, a special form of training is needed to understand its essence in depth.
One of them is imitation games
Before organizing the work of students according to the project method, the life experience of each of them, interest in their independent abilities is studied
Then reports will be selected to ensure the development and formation of its individuality
Work on the project method requires students to be able to work with various software tools
During the training of informatics specialists from the cycle of information disciplines according to the project method, the following topics can be presented to students:
creating presentations using multimedia technologies;
development of information systems;
model research and development;
creation of testing systems;
creation of electronic textbooks;
Creating Websites, etc.
The work of any project includes the following stages:
preparatory period;
Planning period;
The period of the study;
report on presentation of study results;
Project Performance Evaluation Period
You can use the following approach to organizing student project activities
After completing the new theme, a team will be formed to work on the project
This is the preparatory period
Students voluntarily select project partners
It should take into account the performance of students in the subject and interest in the selected topics
Thus, at this stage, the following principle of individual-oriented learning must be respected
The student's independence will be aimed at interest in the topic chosen by his cost
It acts as an active medium of experience, as well as an organization, in agreement with the team, to distribute the work performed among all project participants in the educational process
Next Planning Stage
What should be the end result of the software product created at this stage, its goal will be to determine who will be its user
Selects how to search for information based on the tasks assigned to students in the group
Next phase of the study
During this period, students move to perform laboratory work
Information is collected and analysed
Students during this period work independently
The teacher indicates only the role of the organizer of their activities, how to collect information and the sources of information received
Here, students can use various ICT tools
Also uses the knowledge and experience gained from life
All prepared materials are prepared for project protection
This is presented in the form of a report on the results of the study
Open project protection is an essential part of the work done on the project method
Students during this period systematize the knowledge gained in the course of the study
Evaluation of the result is the final stage of work on the project
Evaluation of project performance considers where the evaluation is used in the form of a monitoring-based rating, where self-evaluation elements are considered: to whom or which element did not like it and which project was well executed
It is very important to listen to the opinion of students in connection with personal-oriented technology
At the same time, the exchange of views and the exchange of impressions of students during this period will affect their further work at a high level
The most important aspect of the project method is to increase the motivation of students to study, as a result of which the quality of their education will also improve
Working on the project, the student himself sees how rationally he worked, that achieving the set goals of the project allows the student to further organize his educational activities independently
The teacher's assessment of the student's personal qualities contributes to his further development in the search for information
As a result, the student becomes the subject of his own educational activity, and not only the carrier of ready-made knowledge, the organizer of his own cognitive research activity [3]
The work performed by students according to the first project method consists in creating a film presentation on free topics after considering the work of application software
Students are independently divided into two or three depending on the size of the computer in the audience
Think about topics among themselves and share the tasks they perform
You can find the necessary information in the book (scanning images or text) or on the Internet
Results of the task are discussed within the group
Students teach people who do not know how to help each other in the process of work
The teacher acts as the organizer of the active supervisor of cognitive activity of students
In conclusion, the project will be discussed and evaluated
The creation of the database for freshmen will be continued during the training of the programming subject in GBS MS Access, and in the second year - projects created in the previous first year when passing the DBMS in the center of Delphi
Students will have to continue previous projects by linking the GBUZ MS Access GL created with components in the Delphi Center
To students as a project
"Library" "Pharmacy" "Students" "Graduates" "Teachers of the department"
"Computer Science Course Software" and
of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Such projects will allow you to go through all stages from the design of the GP to the creation of a completed information system to unify the knowledge gained by students in the implementation of a specific application task
By this method, students carry out interdisciplinary communication
adapts to the creation of the software base used in future professional activities, improving training through projects
Such presented independent cognitive tasks are the main core of their independent work
Projects related to DBMS allow students to confidently master the basic concepts of the Civil Code and use them at a high level
Practical work during this project, firstly, resembles the basic concepts of the Civil Code using the demonstration program for MK, and then goes on to an independent project
The main issue is the organization of student knowledge control
After completing the basic theoretical materials, it is checked to the extent that students are proficient in the basics of theoretical knowledge, by testing and on frontal issues
In the future, how much they have the skills and skills to create practical MKs is evaluated during the protection of the created project
The main purpose of such projects is:
organizing the joint work of teachers and students to create educational resources;
publication of teaching materials;
organizing discussions on important issues;
write collective conversations with the team in search of a solution to the issue;
online conferences and competitions
Writing articles on the University's website together with the team for posting interesting works, virtual excursions with annotation comments
In the course of project activities, students are assigned the following tasks:
Competent Internet search, including the use of its search engines;
joint storage of different materials together to select different documents for repair;
A generalized assessment of the information received with the wording of their views;
responsible use of Internet resources
The design method can be organized precisely during the training of any cycle of information disciplines
This year, during the course "Programming" (object-oriented programming), students were presented with project topics
Students chose five topics from them: "create a text editor"
"Creating an electronic textbook" Creating a testing system "" Creating a telephone directory "Amazing Places in Almaty"
At the end of the training process
Intellectual competition "Art of programming: Who recently?" Organized among students of the 2nd grade of the specialty "Informatics - 5B011100"
3 year students of this specialty were invited as participants
Each group presented its own projects
The analysis of the results of the competition was attended by students of the 3rd year.
The best projects awarded with diplomas
Prepared works based on the project method, students place in their electronic portfolio
Annual test work shows that the proposed method yields a positive result
This, firstly, increases the interest of students in study, secondly, attracts students to search work and increases their creative and creative abilities
Third, consolidated project work on each subject, their future
is based on the accumulation of materials related to professional activities (E-portfolio) and the formation of experience

The article will consider the issue of electronic teaching and methodological support of special disciplines in the process of training future teachers of informatics
As an example, the subject "Theory of programming languages ​ ​ and translation methods" was chosen
Analysis of the basic concepts, which set out the principle of operation of the programming system
The model of analysis and synthesis of the program on the computer is given
Program translation stages are provided on the computer and a program is created that reflects a demonstration model of the operating principle of the programming system
Parsing the lexical analysis of semantic analysis of the programming system
Practice shows the need of society for people who, in the context of the dynamic growth of the socio-political and economic status of the Republic of Kazakhstan, can actively influence the increase in the competitiveness of the state, affecting developing ideas in accordance with real changes that can think of intellectually developed talent
Kazakh society's desire for global educational standards is explained by the strategic goal of reforming the education system, which ensures the creation of favorable conditions for the realization of their intellectual and creative potential for the development of children with established intellectual potential
Future of Kazakhstan is determined by young generations, therefore the most important tasks of education system are revealing potential abilities and talents of youth
In this direction, the State and the Head of State
Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools and Nazarbayev University successfully operate within the framework of the Daryn program
Head of State N
In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan dated January 27, 2012 "Socio-economic transformation is the main direction of development of Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev noted: "Their experience should be extended to all Kazakh education systems and brought to the level of all educational institutions"
Kazakhstan has set the task of training specialists who can think creatively within the framework of the reform of the higher education system
Improving the competitiveness of education for the adopted State Program for the Development of the Education System for 2011-2020 will be aimed at developing human capital by achieving quality knowledge to ensure sustainable economic development
In higher education: "
the need for an individual to achieve a high level of quality education in accordance with world educational practices that meet the needs of the labor market for the industrial and innovative development of the country "[1]
The higher school of any state assumes the main responsibility in the formation of the intellectual human resources of the country, necessary for the implementation of the strategy of innovative development as a social institution, since the education of society is a condition for the development of the entire part of the economy
This question indicates the need to improve the quality of training of specialists through the introduction of innovative technologies in the higher education system
It requires, first of all, changing the content of training in specialties and technologies for teaching methods and tools in accordance with modern requirements
We are guided primarily by the capabilities of information and communication technologies in introducing innovative technologies and even elements of innovative technologies into the learning process [2]
In this article, we discuss the issues of electronic educational and methodological support of disciplines of a special specialty in the specialties "Informatics - 5B011100"
One of the main special disciplines for students in the specialty of informatics -
It is the subject of "Programming"
For this reason, the subject Olympiad of secondary school students takes place in this discipline, so knowledge of this discipline is of great importance for its better understanding.
The task of developing the knowledge and skills and subject competencies of students in this discipline
The basics of programming assigned to several special disciplines begin with course 1 and continue until the defense of a diploma in 4 years (Object-oriented programming Programming Technology Programming Theory of programming languages ​ ​ and translation methods Data Foundation and information systems Programming on the Internet System programming Logical programming and the basics of artificial intelligence, etc.
Electronic training and methodological support of these disciplines is one of the current issues that are not included in the agenda
One of the main subjects of these disciplines is "Theory of programming languages ​ ​ and translation methods"
Lack of textbooks on this discipline and teaching aids in Kazakh
For better in-depth programming, he must understand how to implement it on a computer, not only at the theoretical, but also at the practical level.
Improving the effectiveness of training in each discipline depends on the quality of its teaching and methodological support
During the study, we tried to solve this problem by creating a demonstration program that simulates the principle of the functioning of the programming system
Let us dwell on the basic concepts concerning the issue raised
How do we first understand the programming system? A programming system is a system for creating a new program in a specific programming language
Programming system - part of the main software that accompanies the programming process
The functions of the programming system include:
a translating program which the user translates from a programming language to a machine code command;
Program Syntax and Logic Error Recorder
Programming tools that perform these functions include a compiler and interpreter assembler
Let's analyze the concept of a model before proposing a model of our work
The model is a mathematical formula scheme with a reserve of these physical structures and we describe one or another form created in the form of an algorithm for their processing [3]
Modeling objectives: understanding the value of the object under study; determining the scope of application of the object and improving the method of control; solution of application objectives; forecasting the application area for direct and general purposes
The main types of model classification are classified into several groups
According to the territory of the first application, one can classify: training (training manuals for additional training programs) practical (ship models of machines (for studying objects necessary for any future science) scientific and technical (discharge device of synchrophasotron current strength, t
) imitation (effective military-economic sports games) imitation (new drugs are tested on muscles to determine the quality of drugs and t.
According to the classification factor of the second time report:
dynamic model
Statistical model - providing this form with information at any given time
For example, in a dental clinic, the manifestation of the oral cavity of the same time is transmitted to the patient: the number of milk and persistent teeth, the number of fillings applied, tooth defects, etc.
Dynamic models reflect a change in an object at a specific time
For example, you can get an outpatient card of a student of school age, which changed the diagnostic signs of teeth several years ago to the present
display up to
For the third way of displaying: material and information model
Material model - real or physical
They demonstrate the geometric and physical properties of the original
Information model - a collection of information characterizing the properties and state of the object process, and the relationship with the outside world
The information model is divided into two: symbolic and verbal
Marking model - an information model indicated by special signs, that is, by any means of artificial language
An example for marking models is the graphic diagrams of the figure
Verbal model - an information model created in the form of a thought or conversation
Depending on the display form, the information model can be classified into the following groups [4]:
geometric model graphics and three-dimensional designs;
verbal model - oral and written description using illustration;
mathematical model - an object or mathematical formulas that reflect the relationship of various process parameters;
structural models - graphs and tables
logical model - models that reflect different choices of actions, based on the analysis of the results of thought and conditions;
special models - chemical formula notes
The center is the widespread use of computers and mathematical models related to the activities of people in different fields
A mathematical model is a predictable description of a class of objects and phenomena in the world of real mathematical language
The main goal of modeling is to study objects and predict the result in the future
Creating a mathematical model is the main stage of the designed or investigated industry in any system
The quality of the model depends on the examination of the object for the entire period
Creating a model is an informal procedure
Directly depends on the researcher, and his experience and taste are always assigned to a specific experimental material
The model should be accurate and easy to use
Now let's create a simple report program in Pascal and see how this report will be run on your computer
Create a program to detect the area and perimeter of the triangle by the value of the walls of the specified triangle
When analyzing the report output algorithm, the first data will be entered with a description of the data presented first
Detection of triangle area and perimeter: S = 1/2 (ab) and P = (a + b + c)
calculated by formulas
His Pascal program:
Writeln ("enter abc values"); Read (abc);
Now let's take a look at how this simple example of a program runs on your computer and how it will be implemented
When implementing a program on a computer, when executing the program, values ​ ​ corresponding to the primary data and the computer are assigned
displays the corresponding result
Let's try to analyze the sequence of actions performed on the computer, starting from sending the program to run and ending with displaying the result on the screen [56]
Sample analysis of the program is given in Figure 1
drawing
Sample Program Analysis
Special program for translation of written program into computer language -
The translator is a program - the translator processes the source text into an object module and translates the program text into a language acceptable for understanding the computer
The logical translation process consists of two stages: analysis and synthesis (assembly)
The analysis period (where the source text is analyzed) consists of three corresponding phases: lexical analysis; parsing; semantic analysis
The synthesis period (where the program code is processed in a machine-oriented representation) consists of the following phases: per machine - the code of independent generation; machine - code of independent optimization; memory allocation; generation of machine code; optimizing machine code
Simplest part of the compiler in a lexical analyzer-design
Quotations are generated from lexes [7]
The source text program is sequentially sent to the compiler in the form of a token
Lexema is a certain indivisible part of the language (object), considered as a unit
This can be either a keyword or a variable name or an operation character (Figure 2)
drawing
Lexical analysis
Parses - processed according to formal grammar rules, syntax errors are checked (Figure 3)
drawing
Parsing
Semantic analysis - checking the content of the text, as well as solving complex problems in the implementation of the program
Semantics is closely related to the generation of machine code and its manufacture
The parsing result consists of four steps: an operation code in two operations and a result (Figure 4)
drawing
Semantic analysis
During synthesis, the memory space of the computer is allocated in accordance with the accounting agreement
The report, created in one programming language, will be translated into a machine language and executed on a computer, and then will present to us the final result in a clear language
A demonstration of this model was carried out in Macromedia Flash
Practice has shown that the quality of education is significantly improved if the trained special disciplines in the professional training of specialists are equipped with such visual electronic teaching aids

Computer science is a training discipline that reveals the capabilities of a computer as a conductor in the flow of information and as a powerful means of processing it, which allows you to form skills for working with information related to a general subject
And a teacher of informatics through interdisciplinary communication can improve the methods and forms of organizing training in the content of educational material and improve the quality of school education, such as the subtlety of the depth of systemality
At the same time, interdisciplinary connections, being an instrument for the development of basic concepts in informatics, allow you to consciously master the connections between them, expand the worldview of students
Strengthening interdisciplinary communication with mathematics in the study of computer science will form the ability of a student to creatively apply the knowledge that they were able to develop, developing knowledge of cognitive motivations
The article presents relevant examples, considered as a condition for the development of cognitive motivations of students to be able to carry out interdisciplinary communication when teaching informatics at school
Keywords: informatics; training; cognitive motivation; interdisciplinary communication; mathematics
In a rapidly changing socio-economic and information technology environment, it is important to constantly supplement knowledge and knowledge, especially on its own.
As a result, students will continue to study independently and update their knowledge.
All this can be achieved thanks to constantly developing cognitive motivation
Recently, the development of cognitive motives of students also concerns teachers of informatics
Because in the early stages of training, as before, the main motivation factor, and although the object of training in informatics - computer is the main tool of training, its attractiveness is not still reduced
You can develop cognitive motivation of students in computer science lessons starting from grades 5-6
To do this, when studying a certain topic in computer science lessons, it is useful for students themselves to use reports published directly in other educational subjects, including in the process of studying mathematics
Because as a result, the student will get acquainted with the use of knowledge obtained in computer science in mastering other educational disciplines by developing knowledge in mathematics
In particular, on modeling algorithms and t
Teaching of related teaching materials allows the use of teaching assignments in relation to other teaching disciplines
For example, in this case, it is advisable to use different mathematical calculations
Then students will have to reveal the importance of informatics and familiarize themselves with the application of its methods in Maematics
Knowledge of the basics of traditimization allows them to independently check the correctness of the method used by him in outputting reports from the subject area of ​ ​ mathematics, to observe his performance in conducting the same type of calculations, which are difficult to get acquainted with the capabilities of a computer
When studying text graphic editors, when compiling sites, materials are used in other educational subjects, along with information educational materials
And when studying formalization and modeling processes, depending on versatility, you can use reports in various training disciplines
Based on this, the following types of interdisciplinary communication can be distinguished: indirect theoretical communication in this case is considered in other subject areas for a better understanding and assimilation of educational material from informatics, as well as a direct theoretical connection arises from the impossibility of studying a topic without a certain knowledge of other educational disciplines; practical connection consists in the fact that students are provided with reports on other educational subjects, but are trained in informatics by conducting their output through methods and means of informatics, while the role of informatics based on educational materials that are considered interesting to students is revealed their importance in other fields of knowledge
The knowledge gained from computer science lessons can be of a specific applied nature, so the content of reports obtained from other educational disciplines provided for in this framework and the methods of their release require certain knowledge in this discipline.
Consider examples of this
In the 6th grade, during the mastering of the section "Incompatimization and Modeling" in the subject of informatics [1] are covered by the mathematics of educational materials
it is important to uncover the link
Algorithm - cast the output path of a given report to the type of sequence of ordered actions, that is, any calculation can be derived by sequentially performing simple actions
Algorithms can be offered in different ways
Graphical mapping of the algorithm helps to output text reports in mathematics lessons
For example, the condition of report No. 29, given on page 14 of the mathematics textbook of class 6. The ratio of the masses of gold and silver in the mixture is 5:3
1) How much gold does 16 g contain in the mixture? 2) How much silver does 56 g contain in the mixture? [2] The algorithm for issuing this report is shown in Figure 1
This example can be used when considering linear algorithms
Tables 12 below show the ways to construct algorithms for several calculations from the mathematics textbook
drawing
Report output algorithm 29
Mathematical Reporting Algorithms
Mathematics in the image of branched algorithms in the form of a flowchart
As an example, when interpreting the topic "Properties of numerical inequalities," one can cite algorithms for detecting a smaller number of two numbers
To convert numerical inequalities, the properties of numerical inequalities are used
For example, property 1
If the number a is greater than the number b, the number b will be less than the number a
The algorithm of this example is shown in Figure 2.

Math Column Diagrams
Tables "can be linked to Microsoft Excel in Computer Science
A column chart is used to compare different values of the same quantity
A graphical diagram consists of columns of the same length, located at the same distance along a line
For Example 1 on page 285 in the math tutorial, fill in the table as in Figure 3 in Microsoft Excel
Next, by selecting the entire table, the Input-Diagram-Histogram will be built by the computer itself (Figure 3)

Humanization of education is one of the key principles at the stage of reform of higher education
Therefore, in order to solve the problem of introducing humanitarian companies, it is necessary to focus on the beginning of science and consider internal issues
Mathematics is one of the most important components of human culture, which contributes to the development of the student personality
This work provides for the humanization of science and mathematical education
Reflection of this issue - development of education in the knowledge of the environment

In the Concept of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2003-2015 in the State Program for the Development of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2005-2010 (2004
09) and Concepts of humanitarian education in the Republic of Kazakhstan (26
2004) One of the areas of reform of the education system is the humanization of education
Socio-economic changes in the Republic are accompanied by a process of major modernization of human consciousness, which requires the re-differentiation of fundamental and universal education and a significant expansion of its field and the implementation of this business through the education system
Today, society is once again moving the traditional idea of ​ ​ a political task on the way to the transition of education from productive support to cultural and creative heritage
Humanitarian education is manifested as a way of building a social and cultural image of a person, as it helps to overcome criticality and inferiority in the development of the person, thereby increasing the ability of everyone to find a civilian basis for revealing his internal potential
The humanitarian nature of education in it is expressed not only as an object of simple research, but above all as a subject of creativity and knowledge, born of images of powerful culture, and as a subject who, with his passion for creativity, disgustingly brings out students
The humanization of society - the demand for civilized development on the threshold of the 21st century - is connected with the achievement of effective forms of organizing social relations, and in these relations, first of all, a person, as a lever of the world, looks very expressive
Now the tool for achieving the goal of humanization is the humanization of the formation of intelligentsia, the education of a culture of sensual sentiment, a multifaceted process involving the establishment of a certain system of vital values ​ ​ and guidelines
Because in tomorrow we see that the current culture is moving towards the society formed by us in the framework of today's education and upbringing.
The main task of humanizing education is to attract the entire complex of educational education and culture to the education of a person of humanistic orientation
The requirement to humanize education - first of all, to determine the humanitarian potential of all educational disciplines and to properly change their teaching methods
Today, a graduate of an educational institution can at any time take part in a business conversation so that he can turn to the logical presentation of his game on knowledge of foreign languages ​ ​ in the amount necessary to create mutual relations with the development of history and theory of his profession, as well as for specialized disciplines, in order to be able to constantly communicate with the art world.
The main task of organizing the educational process for the humanization of knowledge is a new structure of training taking into account the changes in the socio-economic life of the country - basic courses, the content of which is determined by the state standard for special courses determined by the departments themselves
and switch to courses that students choose
As well as the introduction of humanitarian content in textbooks of general and special disciplines
The analysis of the education system of many leading countries of the world, as noted in the state educational program, has become the driving force for a radical change in the structure of education in our country with the content of its goals and technologies
The main goal was that the priority should be the formation of a person who is developing and able to reveal himself in a rapidly changing world, which will become a source of ideas that can independently find and analyze intellectual resources, and not mechanically transfer knowledge.
Identification of problems of humanization of education and ways to solve it
) a significant contribution was made by the international congress [1]
The content of these documents and materials determines the strategy of education with the observance of its fundamentality, the provision by society of modern conscious education of the state in accordance with relevant issues of the individual and the needs of the future
The development of the study of the problems of humanization (humanization) and humanization of education continues in the scientific works of not only teachers and methodologists, but also specialists in the humanitarian social and natural industries.
The pedagogical encyclopedia presents a large encyclopedic dictionary
Consider the definitions of the terms "humanization" "humanization" "humanitarian" "humanization" "education" "humanization of education" [2]:
humane (humane) (lat.
humanus - human love for man, aimed at the good of others)
humanism (lat.
humanity-morality) - recognition of the right of this person to develop his dignity as a person to freely monitor his ability
Approval of the human good as an assessment of social relations
- Humanitarian (French.
humanitas-human nature)
In education, creative activity and mood related to the attitude of power to the environment are valuable; the process of personal and internal development related to the development of material and spiritual culture and the development of socially significant human experience, clearly expressed in the need to preserve
The main ways of education - education and self-education
Humanization of education
A system of measures for the formation of personal maturation of a student, aimed at drawing attention to the development of components of a general culture of educational content
Gelman draws attention to the role of the history of the development of science in the humanization of knowledge
In his opinion, the integration of humanitarian education is possible on the basis of the history of science and natural science
Because they gradually become knowledge that determines the mechanisms for the development of all civilization
They are trained
Firstly, the possibility of determining the dialectical development of scientific knowledge and culture determines, secondly, the reflection of such a method in regulating the unity of science and culture in theoretical and practical action
Zinchenko considers the problems of humanization of science from the point of view that natural and humanities are part of a single and world culture: "
Science shows and demonstrates a social cultural organism (organism)

must! In particular, the functional body formed by humanity in the process of historical development "[4]
One of the main processes is the principle of humanization of education in the reform of higher education at the modern level of the development of society
Applying this position to mathematics not only provides students with mathematical knowledge, but also develops their intellectual potential through mathematics, because, as Plato said, "a person flexible to mathematics is more flexible than to other science."
Therefore, it is necessary to determine the humanitarian potential of each science, focusing on its history of development.
If we look at the development of science, then its effective mathematics can be observed without problems
If you look deeper, you can observe the reverse process - the use of the humanities in those areas of education where under normal conditions humanitarian methods are not considered
Of course, it differs from the fact that mathematics extends to other sciences
The transition of mathematics to other fields of knowledge will not change the concepts of the problems posed, but will allow us to develop the concepts of their models.
Humanities, together with its penetration through widespread dissemination in non-State fields of education, in some cases become an integral part of its enrichment
As an example, consider the ways in which logic develops
What do you mean "logic"?
The logic in its content is to encode and unify the rules of thinking
Logic could be called humanitarian discipline from Aristotle to the middle of the last century
After the work of Bull, the second life of logic began
Logic has become a mathematical discipline
On the one hand, it is used to analyze the fundamentals of mathematics, and on the other, it is an invaluable tool in solving problems of technology (designs of computer machines are being developed)
Mathematical logic is certainly mathematical, but it derives from logic, which is an established humanitarian subject
This is not the mathematics of humanities or the humanization of mathematics.
The situation with psychology is especially interesting
"At some point, psychology lost its significance as an independent subject, part of its problems was associated with the physiology of the higher nervous system" -
In the government of the former council, he stopped training specialists from higher education institutions who will not study as private subjects
There was no centre for large-scale psychological research
This point of view remained until representatives of the equipment realized that not only cars are needed, but also higher "man-machine," became interested in how to conduct psychological research
Issues of the modern development of science depend on the conditions for creating computer languages ​ ​ by machine translation of texts between individual computers to create false intelligence for human problems
A long stay underwater in space determines the direction of movement at high speeds - all this requires knowledge of the engineering aspects of the human psyche
This suggests that engineering issues that are addressed through mathematics face humanitarian challenges
Engineering systems are designed without attention to human science
At the end of the 19th century, a special interest arose in understanding how the structure of mathematics is arranged in it
In this regard, the "Logic of the development of science" was created, analyzing the basics of mathematics
In the west
the broad concept of "philosophy of science" [56]
It all began with the study of the rocks of Russell's theory of mathematical fees
Then Hilbert began to prove the absence of an absolute contradiction in the structure of mathematics
In his famous 1931 theorem, Gedel showed that the possibility of deductive thinking has a limited position, that is, the insufficiency of Hilbert's theory, which is a contradiction in the structure of mathematics
Thus, this formulation became the most unexpected force of epistemalogy about the results
In fact, it was not a philosophical thought, but a mathematical one
With an emphasis on Kant and Leibniz, which laid the foundation for mathematics, it is not a philosophical subject
Here mathematics, more precisely its sections, is supplemented by philosophical content as the report is made
The knowledge-intensive section "Logic of the development of science" has become a science that studies the question of how hypotheses are put forward about how various sciences are created, how they are accepted or how unacceptable practices are organized, how its methods and forms will be concluded
The results of such a logical analysis, having found application in everyday scientific work, lose their abstraction and are humanized, that is, used for everyday human life
So, no matter what field of science we lead, we see humanities
This is an obvious fact
How to comment on this?
Once around the time when Pasteur did not manage science or specifically did not direct, a person brought the child unconditional benefit [78]
Are there any consequences that the current deterioration of resources, pollution, spread of some diseases, given that crime is becoming more and more drug addiction, does not indicate the direct and disproportionate consequences of the development of science?
Despite high expectations in science to prevent these phenomena, there are no positive results
From this it follows that the development of final science should be of a specially directed nature.
At the same time, human civilization in its entire life, unfortunately, thanks to the existing help of mathematics to practice, began to gather more and more data, leading to death and suffering from environmental disasters under the influence of experience and scientific actions on nature
In particular, scientists are exempt from the moral response to the consequences of applying discoveries and results to practice
Other types of nuclear chemical and bacteriological weapons are invented and tested, including on humans
Due to irreversible environmental problems that have arisen over the past decades, weather changes and ozone faults occur on Earth, while the fauna of the world's ocean space becomes destroyed.
This can cause enormous losses to global weather and the environment, resulting in the destruction of all life on Earth
Hence, most of human society began with the suspicion that scientific and technological progress is the main condition for the development of civilization
As an example of this, it is enough to recall programs that lead to tension between the technology of science and its moral restriction, which has no moral and ethical basis in the implementation of mass nuclear tests, such as the turning of some West Siberian rivers towards central Asia, the construction of nuclear power plants.
MATHEMATICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
The activities of any branch of science are aimed at conquering nature, ultimately abstract, depending on its composition
The uncontrolled and free influence of science on the large ecological system, of which man is a part, becomes dangerous
From this he is tired to the level of security of space
The development of science has affected the burden of responsibility, which we cannot raise
Ideally, a person is not ready for this
That is, the thinnest partitions are formed here, ready for rupture
In this sense, the personality acts as the lever of the sphere of application of the development of science and its results.
Understanding this simple phenomenon lies in understanding the main reason why general science, including mathematics, has embarked on the path of humanization

Article: General obligatory state standards of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Higher education; In the transition to a new undergraduate education, bachelor's studies in mathematics are provided
Particular attention is paid to the practical approach to learning, and therefore human development is envisaged in terms of expanding the range of types and forms of activities available to it.
It, in particular, provides for several forms of independent work of schoolchildren: creative forms with instructions for performing variations according to the model
Content of own concrete creative works for bachelors
under Analytical Function Theory
The article focuses on a practical approach to active learning technologies
These technologies are an example in the role of a teacher: the role of the facilitator's computer manager instead of the role of an informant and an example in the role of a student: information is changing as a tool for the misuse of professional actions and approaches
Practical approach to teaching bachelors, tasks for independent work, own creative works on the theory of analytical function, educational projects
Overcoming existing stereotypes, including in pedagogical education, is impossible without a mandatory pedagogical intelligent culture
Around the world, including in Kazakhstan, there are large-scale changes in the education system
Such changes did not affect all levels of the education system, especially the higher vocational education system
The Council of Europe has formulated five main competencies, the existence of which for graduates in 1996 is the goal of education
Ability to take responsibility for participation in group decision-making such political and social competencies as forceful conflict resolution (conflict) to play a role in improving the governance of democratic institutions
Competencies related to life in a multidisciplinary society
The competence to know oral and written relations, which currently do not have such competence for work and social life, risk social exclusion, is of great importance to know more than one language in terms of such communication.
competence in connection with increasing awareness of the Company; Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of such technologies and looking critically at information disseminated by the media and advertisers
The capacity for lifelong learning as the basis of continuing learning, both in its professional sense and in the sense of social life [1 b
MATHEMATICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
One of the first tasks in the system of higher vocational education is the development of pedagogical education, in particular, the training of mathematics teachers
Changes that have affected math knowledge at school require other math teacher training
The school needs a modern teacher who knows how to solve the tasks assigned to the school
A teacher of modern mathematics must perfectly master innovative learning technologies, thanks to which the teacher must teach students not only the skills and skills, but also the skills that the person needs
The above-mentioned circumstances make problems in improving the process of training a mathematics teacher an urgent issue
Today, among the main issues is not only the armament of future mathematics teachers with mathematical knowledge, but also the formation of professional competencies in the future, as school practice shows
A teacher of modern mathematics must first focus on the tasks of developing the educational process, and then reach it
A future mathematics teacher can gain access to such professional competencies if he used effective teaching technologies when studying at a university.
Such technologies are those built on an effective approach
Of particular importance in action is the concept of "action"
In this regard, the article notes that "the type of action can be a systemically important element of the process (process); the subject of learning takes an active position, and in the presence of action is the main tool and condition of personality development "[2
The positions given in the works of the dalinger [2 3 4] radically change the relationship between the teacher and the student
While traditional didactics are limited to the consideration of methods and forms of transferring ready education to students, modern didactics are based on an effective approach to learning
Human development is an expansion of the range of types and forms of action available to him
Borovsky and N
Rozov in the preface to his books said: "All known knowledge prepares children, but what are they prepared for? Our goal is to approach this answer more closely and to reveal its essence
Decryption of the final meaning of the term "action" [5 b
In particular, a person's desire to interfere in activities determines the goal of knowledge
Halperin, speaking about the role of actions in knowledge and education, writes the following: "The fact that assimilation is carried out exclusively individually is true, but it itself must be thought out in advance, that is, organized" [6b]
Different scientists understand the difference of components in the structure of the action
For example, E
In the action structure, Yudin refers the target result tool and his own action process
Khutor proposes the nature of a more expanded interpretation of the structure of action; it identifies the method and results of action of the subject under the object contract
Leontiev introduced into the structure the actions of the procedure aimed at solving independent calculations of substance conversion [7]
These and other analyses show the need to create conditions that enable learners to develop cognitive needs in acquiring abilities that influence the formation of skills and skills in its use and creative activities in teaching and staffing.
The centuries-old history of pedagogy shows that actions, including cognitive ones, arise with the independent work of students
It is known that there are following types of independent works: independent work on a sample with reference to performance of work of variable character
In the academic process, bachelors studying in mathematics are all of great importance, but creative work is more important
Creative work is so effective that they not only teach a bachelor's degree in mathematics, but also serve as professional training for future mathematics teachers.
That is, as a result, a future math teacher must have a qualification that can put reports to students with creative problems that must be solved
New State mandatory standards in the education system of the Republic of Kazakhstan, adopted in 2010, are aimed at the formation of main competencies among bachelors studying in the specialty [8] of mathematics, expressing their readiness to act in specific conditions
One of these competencies is "the ability to organize educational and cognitive activities of students in accordance with age and personal qualities"
the ability to encourage students to engage in cognitive activities during classes and outside classes "
Our work shows the organization of educational activities of students in optional classes [910]
Issues of organization of research work of students V
Dalinger's work is fully envisaged
According to him
"The success of the research activities of students is largely ensured by the use of effective task systems with the correct design of the types and forms of tasks, as well as the able leadership of the teacher of this activity
Note his following system of actions: the ability to choose the necessary level of educational research work in accordance with the level of development of the student's thinking; the ability to mutually identify individual and group forms of conducting research work during classes and outside classes; ability to create problematic conditions related to the level of training, its place in the structure of classes and the goals of classes "
The above requirements were aimed at organizing research activities of students, but, as our experience shows, they are directly related to organizing research activities of bachelors.
We show the organizational creative work of bachelors using the example of the section "Theory of analytical functions"
The section "Theory of an analytical function" includes the following issues: "Application of complex numbers and methods of complex numbers" "Concept of a complex variable of a function" "Continuity and limit of a function of a complex variable" "Differentiation of a function of a complex variable" "Analytical functions" "Complex variable
MATHEMATICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
integration of "Integrals dependent on parameters" "Rows in the plane of the complex" "Riemann surface" and others
Independent work of bachelors can enter the format of educational projects, through which students independently choose materials and prepare computer presentations
When performing study projects, it is very important that bachelors can determine the relationship of the course and the school course at the university with algebra and the analysis initiative
This will be the professional training of future mathematics teachers.
Let us give examples of educational projects that we used in our practical work on the theory of analytical functions:
- Historical aspects of analytical function theory;
- Application of conformal mapping to natural issues;
- Use of complex numbers in solving physical and technical calculations;
- Entry of elements into Complex variable function theory;
- curves and zones in the aft plane;
- Some simple functions and their corresponding conformal images;
- Symmetry rule
Display polygons;
-Integrals and pointing rows;
-Butine and meromorphic functions;
- Cauchy integral theory;
The experience of higher educational institutions fully shows that today higher education is an instrument of social realization for many students, and not specially professional requests; in other words, students are concerned primarily about the social desire to find their place in life, and then become specialists in a certain field of activity
Speaking about the market of educational services, we are talking about a teacher (teacher)
turned into a "service"
This essence of the case is to consider a lecture or seminar as a student educational activity, which makes the nature of the student's educational and cognitive activity completely different
If, for example, a student enters a pedagogical university, but does not focus on the profession of a teacher, he only thinks about receiving a diploma, then he does not seek to accept the teacher's pedagogical experience, even if he is the highest professional, because he does not need this experience for future professional activities
This prevents the creation of a favorable psychological atmosphere in the pedagogical team and leads to the development of the "psychological state" syndrome of teachers
Universities are increasingly connected with the market for educational services, thereby influencing the strategy and tactics of youth behavior of students
Today, the motivation of students is obvious that they have no interest in the educational process and the profession of the future
Today, a new teacher, necessary for society, can be prepared only in the new innovative system of higher pedagogical education
The training of a teacher of mathematics in pedagogical universities requires fundamental changes, which is explained by the following shortcomings that occur in modern conditions:
The help and content of fundamental training at a pedagogical university consists of an educational copy (tracing paper) of a classical university;
The trend of a constant decrease in the number of hours of basic mathematical courses;
The level of school mathematical education of students should have advanced courses in algebra and geometry mathematical analysis
In the multidisciplinary baccalaureate of many educational institutions, the formation of a sixty-hour "buffer" course "introduction to mathematics" is not accidental and implies, as its goal, bringing into line with the requirements of the level of knowledge and skills of students in the school mathematical course;
The elementary course of mathematics does not ensure the stability and variability of students' knowledge and qualifications in school mathematical courses;
Fundamental training of a mathematics teacher is carried out without vocational and pedagogical training
All this requires a change in the content and structure of mathematical and methodological training to strengthen the school component of mathematical education with further consolidation of knowledge

Solution by numeric method
When solving the equation by the quantitative method, the rectangular lattice is moved by the method of marginal difference of the direct digital model (staggered grid) [3]
Calculation of limit difference is entered using integral-interpolation method (balance sheet method) [4]
The calculation process uses the projection method from one step to the next, the Second-Order Projection Method [5]
In the case of incompressible fluid, the continuous equation is explained by the fact that only the velocity vector consists of components, so there is a direct relationship, the pressure of which is not observed, and requires its use
Vector pressure velocity through density equation for compressed liquid flows
This procedure is required in such environments.
Second-Order Projection Method
Calculation of the field speed at each time step using the pressure correction procedure is carried out in two stages
In the first step, the velocity of the intermediate field is calculated without obtaining the continuity equation
In the next step, the correction is applied to provide the field velocity continuity equation
Thus, vectors with zero divergence are "projected" on the field velocity in space (hence the projection method is listed)
If we give equation (1) as the sum of two equations (3) (4), the scheme can be easily obtained by splitting:
where n - get time variable of main index t
- variable time
t in an interval between  t corresponds to time ;
- intermediate value of velocity vector
The pressure from equation (4) must be set to satisfy the condition:
We apply the divergence operator (4) to the equation and obtain the Poisson equation for pressure using equation (5):
Pressure	known	if there is	there	(4)	apply the equation to the velocity correction
Thus, we come to the following calculation scheme:

Poison for pressure at a speed in the interval of time in the first stage
solve equation (6) and determine the pressure field;
during the time period	u 	speed	p	pressure field is known
We apply equation (4)

correct speed
To solve Poisson's equation (6), the SOR (Successful over-relaxation) method was used, which can be used as a direct and iterative method for each sequence
The advantage of this method is to reduce the error for each iteration
At the same time, this method is easily programmed to be used as a criterion at the end of the iteration process
spatial discretization
To sample the report between space and time, the integration-interpolation method (balance method) [2]
We introduce a rectangular grid in the area in question and consider that the pressure is located in the middle of the grid, and the velocity components are located on the extreme sides of the grid (Figure 2)

The velocity components of the pressure in the center of the grid are determined by its ends
To solve the integral equation, limit equations of difference (3) (4) (6) are taken using the simple Gauss-Ostrogradsky volume formula
the equation of limit difference by components of the equation is given as follows:

Surface Fluid Tension in Incompressible Media To describe the dynamics between mismatched fluids, a compression technique (Front tracking method) is used through a polynomial defined by a portion at a specific boundary [6]
This method is also performed for relatively large grids of the movable front
If a page that separates two centers passes through a point, the coordinate is:
Interpolate the movement of the front point through the values ​ ​ of speed and pressure
The basis is different interpolation methods, and we use interpolation bis
To do this, we determine the nodes on the near front regular grid and calculate the speed and pressure values ​ ​ ( in the formula) of the coordinates of these points:

where x-coordinate xi is the straight line of the front point on the left in the grid and y j is the coordinate of the horizontal line of the front point on the bottom of the grid i j is the  value of the designated point on the left and under the grid
We translate from formula (17) to the next front point by determining the velocity value of each point
If we use the simple first order on integral time, then the place of the following new point will be determined:

The scientific article presents the results of the study of the kinetics of physicochemical processes of diffusion nature when heating ceramic samples
Geometric dimensions (thickness) of non-thermal diffusion processes are provided under conditions of heating flat thin models with three different speeds
The object of the study is flat plate-shaped samples made by plastic method from natural mud raw materials.
The kinetics of diffusion processes occurring in connection with the decay of crystalline water when such samples were heated was investigated by computational experiments
Computer digital results are presented in the form of graphs with scientific analysis
Process of flat diffusion of brush-shaped monothermite kinetics isothermal
In nature, transportation processes that take place under non-thermal conditions in technology and technology are often found.
Since such processes are more complex than isothermal processes, they require special research
In connection with the dynamic development of computer technology, the work on quantitative modeling of these processes is accelerated
In previous published scientific work [1] results of quantitative simulation of kinetics of diffusion processes in isothermal conditions on flat thin-walled samples are considered
This scientific paper presents the results of quantitative investigation of the kinetics of diffusion dehydration processes occurring during isothermal heating of thin-walled flat ceramic samples.
In previous works [1-4], the zonal (zonal) mechanism of diffusion processes with a similar nature that occurs in fencing samples was identified
Diffusion processes first begin on the surface of the sample and under the necessary conditions (temperature pressure) gradually move along thin zones (surfaces) at a certain speed towards its internal layers
The process speed in this case is diffusion in nature, limited mainly by the release of gaseous products of physicochemical transformations (reactions) (in our case, water vapors) beyond the completed processes
Calculation experiments were carried out by quantitative examination of the kinetics of the diffusion process during dehydration of the crystalline binder during isothermal heating of plate-shaped samples by plastic molding from monothermic mud raw materials
As a mathematical model characterizing such diffusion processes in flat ceramic samples, the following kinetic equation [2-5] can be obtained.
where
- effective diffusion coefficient; - time; U- contact
the relative mass of the substance (in our case, the water of the crystalline bond); R is half its thickness for the measuring plate
The expression to the right of this equation is the Fourier criterion for mass (Fom
):
It is known that this criterion describes the total duration of mass pumping (diffusion) processes in samples
For the duration (end) of diffusion processes in the considered thin flat samples, that is, for the state U = 0
same value
Then equation (1) can be written with the following criterion:
The peculiarity of the non-thermal situation is that in these processes the effective diffusion coefficient varies depending on the temperature
The dependence of this coefficient on temperature can be characterized by the following definite expression:
where
D0 is a constant value for a given process; E-activation energy; Wg-gas
In practice for the investigated monothermite mud model
the following values are defined:	D  2
Taking into account this expression (1), a kinetic equation can be obtained from the equation, which allows systematically describing the kinetics of non-thermal diffusion processes:

With qualitative comparison of the obtained kinetic curves, one can notice similarities between them
This suggests that they will follow the above-mentioned zonal mechanism, characterized by one general pattern
The quantitative differences in the results obtained (Figures 1-5) can be explained as follows:
Figures 1-3 explain the rapid rapid completion of the processes due to the rapid increase in the diffusion coefficient due to the increase in the heating rate during the firing of samples
And the differences observed in the kinetic curves in Figures 24 and 5 can be explained by the fact that due to the increase in the thickness of the sample, the duration of diffusion processes also increases.
It is possible to note scientific and technological significance of the obtained results by conducting computational practices
The obtained results of the study found practical application for scientific substantiation of the heating modes of ceramic products from natural monothermite mud raw materials

Clarification of the topic of geometric constructions using the construction calculations given here will lead to great success
For example, with algorithmic transmission suitable for teaching the construction of individual regular polygons, the possibility of constructing regular polygons of a higher order by constructing the same regular triangle with the possibility of traditimizing its execution has been proved.
In particular, these traditimic approaches A
It is clear that the teaching of the geometric structures of Farabi, proposed by Kobesov, allows using them to create electronic learning tools using information technologies
Another thing is that in Farabi's treatise, algorithms are presented without A.

Everyone knows that the interest of most schoolchildren in geometry is not so high
One of the reasons for this is still that, due to its substantive specificity, this discipline is conservative.
Over the past one and a half to two decades, significant changes have been observed in the teaching of many other subjects in order to increase the motivation of students to learn a subject based on information technologies.
Abstract nature of geometry materials
significantly narrows the circle
In this regard, in recent years, interactive geometric environments have begun to appear, which are compiling software that allows changing other geometric objects in accordance with a change in some geometric shape.
To achieve this goal, it is financed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Professor E.
According to Bidaybekov, the mathematical legacy of grandfather al-Farabi is based on the modern study of the results using information and communication technologies
So, in the second part of the third "Book on the natural secrets of spiritually bizarre techniques and geometric figures" (article), we considered a number of investigated reports on the algorithm given by al-Farabi, with their modern mathematical justification
Speaking about the methods and results of creating an electronic learning tool for constructing using the algorithm set by Farabi using the correct pentagonal compass and ruler according to a given section, electronic tools have been created for teaching a number of mathematically sound reports

And now, speaking about the calculations of the construction of the planimetry course, we could not find a special interactive geometric environment related to the calculations of geometric construction using the compass and the line
Since all the above and so on centers are intended for a general course of geometry, it is impossible to fully carry out the processes of constructing a compass and ruler using these circles
Of course, as a final result related to the calculation of construction, you can specify a scheme, but we cannot ensure that all the features of geometric construction are covered
Therefore, informatization of geometric construction carried out through a circle and a ruler, that is, the educational process passing through a special interactive geometric environment, can be perceived as the initiative of informatization of geometric formation [456]
In turn, in the process of mastering geometric structures, students learn not only about pure geometric concepts, but also about the processes of the emergence of the first mathematical concepts
That is, in this regard, we can consider the informatization of line reports using a compass and a line as an initiative for the informatization of mathematical education

"The modern paradigm management system allows you to use advanced technologies that are comprehensively developed and form the main processes of scientific prediction
It is impossible to effectively manage any system (object) in relation to various spheres of human activity without assuming its subject, as well as its subsequent achievements, such as the obstacle to achieving the goal to date
The statement "management - that is, forecasting," which we hear, refers to the activities of specialists in various fields and is supplemented by important content in the aspect of responsibility "[2]
Currently, as universities are gradually moving to strategic management, much attention is paid to the theory of management in the field of education
To conduct productive activities by higher educational institutions, the department can carry out many mutually beneficial activities (educational research education cultural and educational and

Due to the need to be ready for tough competition between universities, taking into account modern requirements, universities have created a system of continuous advanced training of universities, supporting the introduction of modern information and communication and educational technologies that ensure the development of the human resources of these universities
Thus, a new quality of education will be created and ensured - the "knowledge economy"
Universities pay great attention to systematic training of employees
The management of the university is aimed at high-quality training and training of highly qualified specialists and is based on process management and system changes
The solution, as an organized response to the problems encountered, is a universal form of both the individual and the social group and is due to the conscious and purposeful nature of human activity.
Solution - Guide the selected activity from an alternative set in the form of a work plan
In practice, many decisions of various nature are taken
However, these charges have any common characteristics that allow them to be classified in a certain way
Decisions made by managers of any team, along with the effectiveness of their activities, determine the possibility of sustainable development
The decision is the results of economic activities taken by university leaders as a result of analyzing several options
Here the listed persons are based on available resources and factors
Organized decision at the university - the choice of the head of this organization, used in the process of performing managerial functions in solving organizational issues
The organized solution will achieve the goal and carry out the mission of the university
The decision of management is a decision-making choice of a targeted influence on the form of management (direction of university activity), based on the analysis of the situation, and has a program to achieve the goal

the learning process;
technical development of the institution;
management activities;
marketing activities;
economic and financial activities;
organization of remuneration and bonuses;
social development;
accounting activities
form of management decision
Management decision can be classified according to different characteristics
For example
management time (strategic tactical operational);
on the content of processes under management (socio-economic technical,
by employee participation level (independent corporate)
The university pays special attention to solving problems that arose in the decision-making process
Problem is that the parameters of the managed system do not meet the objective of managing actual or predicted values
In a problematic situation
deviation of specific parameters from parameters of ordered assignment;
possible deviations in the case of any safety measures;
may give reasons for change of control objective
There are different types of problems
G for educational purposes
Simon's proposed classification is favorable
In this classification, all problems are divided into three classes:
problems that are well structured or quantified so that important dependencies are superseded by numbers or symbols, that is, expressed in quantitative evaluation;
digital expressed problems consisting solely of features and characteristics from the resources described, between which structured or quantitative dependencies are unknown;
mixed problems involving poorly structured or high-quality digital elements
Not very well-known and unidentified parties to this problem tend to create priority conditions
Some problems can change the belonging to a particular class depending on the time
It allows you to understand a lot
Each of the management decisions is unique to itself, but the process of their formation and implementation is subject to internal logic called the "decision cycle" [3]
In institutions, in the decision-making process, different stages in different meals are indicated:
Identification of the problems to which the solution relates (identification of the problem situation);
collection and processing of information for management decision-making;
organization of its execution
These main stages in the preparation of management decisions include the preparation of a scenario for the development of the situation, the preparation of an assessment system for obtaining information on the situation

The article provides for the possibility of using a computer test system to control knowledge
Many adaptive testing options are described
The definition of the information model is based on its application under the control of knowledge
The need to create a computer model of a multi-level information model of knowledge control is determined
Computer model of multilevel information model of control level
METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING
INFORMATIZATION OF EDUCATION
Learning control is one of the main components of the learning process
Not only determining the quality of assimilation based on the final result of training activities as a control activity, but also during control, the trainee, active controller of unmistakable implementation of his thought operations serves as his examination of compliance with the subject and content (provisions to the principles of legality) of the training measurement and orientation of the task of correct solution of the educational task
Monitoring is also a way to get information about the quality of the educational process
Control is aimed at the actions of the student, and also reflects the interaction between the student and the teacher
The actions of the teacher and the student according to its results can be assigned to one of the following levels (each next level includes the previous one)
The first level (I) - reproductive (minimal) - a person can tell others about what they know and can do
The second level (II) - adaptive (low-medium) - a person can adapt their message according to the age and personal characteristics of people working together
The third level (III) - system-modeling (high) - a person can provide his discipline, the opportunity to independently search for new knowledge and be able to use it in the new conditions of activity
At the same time, in the process of personal-oriented training, it is necessary to implement methods of control in the development of the activities of students at the productive reproductive and creative level with an impact in terms of appropriate training and development
In this regard, when preparing control tasks, it is necessary to take into account the presence of problem situations in which the logical behavior of the trainees is possible
Training quality monitoring system is based on computer methods of operational and elementary analysis
When implementing these methods, all controlling actions of trainees are divided into separate operations
Each operation is given a statistical weight that determines the complexity and significance of a given element necessary for assimilation
The trainee's work is monitored taking into account the structure of the established element
Monitoring the quality of such training involves several levels of interpretation of the analysis results
Based on this data, a separate trajectory of possession of mandatory educational material can be created for each student
It will be possible to monitor the qualifications of general thinking, developing not only specific educational material, but also the mental abilities of students
As you know, the mass use of information technologies in the modern world is associated with the effective computer implementation of human actions in life, it is necessary to ensure the individual development trajectory of each student and use computer technologies to effectively assess the quality of training
The computer test system for knowledge control includes:
development of test tasks;
monitoring (testing);
is used only to automate the evaluation of results
The automation of the procedure for performing such tests on the computer is that the complexity of the test task corresponds to the subject and purpose of the test, and t
The same parameters created by experts allow you to create a stock of quality test tasks and in an acceptable form carry out the testing process and the level of knowledge assessment
Reading an area of a specific subject
Due to the large number of test tasks on the final estikhans containing materials, the response to such test tasks is extremely inconvenient for the test stress character, since it takes a lot of time, which leads to the rapid fatigue of the test person, outrage at their decrease during the task and inability to evaluate the level of knowledge of the student when monitoring
Therefore, one of the following ways to improve testing efficiency is to use adapted testing, in which the order of issuing the task and the final assessment depend on the response of the tested
This adaptive control is drawn up in accordance with the knowledge assessment process carried out upon oral request by the teacher from the student
Adaptive Testing - A mandatory link between jobs is that test jobs are created by output, that is, in the form of a structure
The purpose of creating such a structure is decided by experts in accordance with the rules and is poorly transferred to automation
The expert structure is largely determined by the structure of the subject area, and not the purpose of knowledge control
At the same time, the expert pathway is a negligible result when observing the expression of the field of knowledge (in case of difficulty or lack of a logical connection in the expert) or, often, with interdisciplinary test control in medical education, for example, in practice
The absence of a method for constructing a test structure leads to little use of adapted tests in the educational process of certain educational territories
In the Western literature, three versions of adapted tests are distinguished
The first is called pyramid testing
All subjects are given a task at the level of average difficulty without a price
The task is given easily or difficult to each test subject according to the answer
A uniform complexity distribution scale is applied at each step
In the second version, the control starts with any test person as desired
The level of complexity is gradually approaching the real level of knowledge
The third test option is carried out with a divided task pool by difficulty levels
Thus, the adaptive test offers a variant of an automated test system known as complexity parameters and differentiated ability of each task
This system is created as a stock of adjusted computer task descriptions
The most important characteristic of the adapted test task is the level of complexity obtained experimentally
Therefore, the content of the training course is constantly changing and dynamically developing in accordance with the pace of development of scientific and technological progress, hence the need to create a multi-level information model of knowledge control and its computer implementation
The concept of a general model coincides with the concept of "layout," which in everyday life corresponds to a functional or appearance with a certain object
In the process of cognition (learning), while preserving the features that are important for the study given by the model, we present the material replacing the sample object, or the object in the form of thought [1]
And modeling is that an object is a process or process of creating models for studying and studying phenomena
The model processing step determines the properties and other characteristics of any type of feature (as an oral sketch table)
About elementary objects, ideas about the components of this object are formed, that is, an information model appears
"And by the information model we mean a collection of information characterizing the state and activity of an object, and its relationship with the external environment, that is, the information model is created on the basis of information" [2]
The development of information modeling for the educational environment has acquired great importance
METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING

Information modeling or the transition from a specific problem to an information model is one of the most important areas of modern informatics
The information modeling method is related to the concept of the information model
"Information model - a model acceptable for use by the person specified in the form of information"
The information model provides important information about the read object that characterizes the organization of the multi-level hierarchy of the study object
A collection of information is called an object information structure
It requires the display of service communication of information obtained during information modeling, when it is processed and used
Knowledge is such an understanding of an object in a certain science that you can create a model with accurate preservation of the view of the read object
The knowledge of trainees in accordance with the subject area is displayed in the process of interaction with subject-forming objects
"Human thinking is a cognitive action that detects the properties of the latter familiar during interaction with the subject's object"
The specific object of knowledge is always difficult, so the model should be brought into a simpler view for the convenience of learning the object
Informational modeling of the activities of students will determine the technology of introducing new educational information into their education system
During training using the information modeling method, it is possible to determine by what parameters the subjective models formed in the trainees do not coincide with the model of the object of knowledge
The main advantage of information modeling as a method of monitoring and evaluating knowledge - as a result of the analysis, it becomes clear to the teacher what parameters do not match the current model in the student
As a result, the teacher is able to activate the actions of the student in order to form a model in the students that corresponds to the form of knowledge (by performing a specially organized experimental task on the computer that can correct the model)
Allows you to create information reception and transfer of information taking into account the individual characteristics of students with the correct organization of knowledge control [3]
The information process is the training activities of students in connection with the need for students to apply an understanding of the perception of the presented information.
Therefore, students always carry out their training activities in the information environment
Information is a video recorded using characters and symbols
Students make up not only a subject in their information scale as a subject of activity, but also opportunities to work with discipline
A person, creating an image of discipline, simultaneously includes the subject of the action
Here are the main units of price control and execution
Human education is a structural unit - a complex hierarchical structure based on the concept of
The information model provides for the control of absolute knowledge in accordance with the principle of artificial intelligence and, firstly, on a given topic; secondly, generating a test order depending on the previous response during testing; thirdly, provides the possibility of using a method based on working with explicit sets, which allows for logical assessments based on the knowledge and responses of students to produce assessments
Thus, it is possible to objectively and comparatively assess the knowledge of trainees based on controlling the level of knowledge ownership using a computer and preparing control tasks performed on the basis of the information model (also using technical tools)
For example, using level control jobs as a series of tasks on the scale of increase (or decrease) of difficulty levels can be considered acceptable
Non-compliance with knowledge control with moderate frequency of control over training content and incomplete coverage of trainees when compiling control tasks and evaluating trainees' responses to control of subjective knowledge and processing of obtained data.
For this, theoretically justify it by considering the features of controlling the knowledge of students at the present stage; clarification of definition of multilevel information model of knowledge control based on analysis of research works of pedagogical and technical directions; Creation and scientific justification of a multilevel knowledge control information model, taking into account the pedagogical didactic aspects of the knowledge control system; there is a need to create a computer model of a multilevel knowledge control information model with the definition of the didactic foundations of a computer implementation of a multilevel information model for designing pedagogical technologies for knowledge control and knowledge control based on a multilevel information model

in the State Education Development Program of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020: "
secondary education system requires modernization in accordance with modern requirements of Kazakhstan society development and conditions of integration into the world educational space "[1]
At the same time, in the curriculum for grades 5-11 of the secondary school of the Republic of Kazakhstan, one of the main tasks of training in the subject of informatics, students received experience in using information technologies in project activities
In addition, special hours are allocated from informatics for the design activities of students of the basic content of knowledge of each class
It states that at the end of personal results, students must apply their knowledge and qualifications in everyday life and in practice [2]
To date, education is aimed at creating conditions for the independent education of students, as well as at forming their ability to independently solve the problem of making decisions in the social environment, as well as the responsibility and activity of students for information communication (communication) competence
All these issues can be called the result, which is formed on the basis of the project activities of students, therefore the project activities fully cover the progress of education at all stages of school.
Project activities are in line with the psychological and social objectives of student development
With regard to educational objectives, project activities should be considered as a tool for achieving educational results
Unlike educational methods of project activity, students use the acquired knowledge in practice, that is, the ability to study - non-target theoretical education becomes an integral part of the project activity
Therefore, the content of knowledge for the organization of project activities should be considered as a means of organizing practical work
This means that the class
both in the teaching system and in textbooks and programmes, student-teacher relationships also require changes in management and evaluation and monitoring
The general subject of informatics within 30 years from the moment of inclusion in the school curriculum has the degree of "special subject"
The content of the course of informatics in accordance with the pace of development of scientific and technological progress is constantly changing and
dynamically developing, and there is a need to improve the process of training in informatics
As disciplines expand, interest in students will increase
Due to the fact that the 21st century is the age of information, it can be said that informatics has a special place in the formation of abilities for the use and choice of information technologies necessary for the formation of the personality of the citizen of each society and his life in the information society, as well as for him to find an effective solution with the right guidance in the flow of information.
When teaching computer science, students combine the knowledge gained from the lessons and ask questions outside the school curriculum
Therefore, the computer science teacher needs to attract the interest of the student through the organization of project and research activities of a continuous educational channel
To organize students' project and research activities in the classroom, the teacher himself must first have an interest in this method and the ability to conduct it
Based on this, it is necessary to be able to independently summarize the knowledge gained by students and navigate the information space and develop cognitive skills
That is, the combination of opportunities to visually think and use them in real practical actions
In general, you can distinguish between two areas of organization of project activities of students
The first choice of topics that allow students to freely organize research activities among the basic curricula in schools
That is, projects, along with solving substantive problems, include the necessary communication information systems, including students' knowledge of the lessons
Capacity Building
The second is characteristic of design, not aiming to fulfill the entire design structure - the analysis of the current situation is interested in the independent development of new information with the issuance of small tasks
That is, there is more freedom to organize the research activities of the student than it is important to make a whole project
The personal development of the student is carried out only if his theoretical knowledge obtained in the lesson during the specified task becomes a tool for completing the task
The project may be small, but the traditional "exercise run" "do not teach the rules"
The product of the project may not be manual or visible, but it should be a task in the form of creative freedom, different from traditional classes
Currently G
In the work of many scientists, such as Alnazarova
Design - translated from Latin
means "move forward," that is, it can be considered as a solution to a certain practical problem [3]
By the definition of Leontovich, research actions of students are actions related to solving creative and research problems without a preliminary solution
The structure of any research work will be the same in all areas: synthesis of research methods and their application in practice, synthesis and synthesis of own materials, conclusion of the final result [4]
To organize the project and research activities of students, first of all, the student must be psychologically self-determined
Self-knowledge is one of the goals of the pedagogical process, which helps to reveal the talent and abilities of the individual to realize his positive opportunities [5]
Therefore, design and

The purpose of research actions in the field of informatics is to develop the creative capabilities of the student through the self-realization of knowledge in the territory of interest to him
To achieve this goal, it is necessary to solve the following pedagogical problems:
improvement of students' scientific and thought abilities and mastering of research methods;
improving the intellectual and creative abilities of students when working on the project;
developing the ability to work independently with the theoretical and practical sections of the project during work;
deepening of previously acquired theoretical and practical knowledge;
To teach the public to behave freely for a limited time and to communicate clearly the meaning of the project;
development of interdisciplinary communication [6]
The choice of the project theme will be varied when the topic is focused on the student's own interest outside the curriculum
Project work will be prepared during the training on the topics chosen jointly by teachers and students on the topics of classes
For example, when teaching grade 8 on the topic "Logical basics of a computer," many students do not understand why the principles of the functioning of logical functions and logical tables are studied
In this regard, their interest will disappear, and the question arises of the mismatch of theoretical knowledge with practice
To solve such questions, students can be given individual project work on the following topics: "How to choose a profession?" - assembly of tests; compiling tests on the subject of informatics
These works will be prepared by students using the logical function ESLI () in the table editor Microsoft Excel
Creating a test increases students' interest in protecting it by performing functions such as clearing response cells using macros
Computer science lessons will establish an equal partnership between the student and the teacher using the design method and will form skills for the systemic solution of this problem
This method is always aimed at ensuring that the student acts independently, that is, for some limit time in person or in group work he achieves the result [6]
Consider Rokhlov's proposed methodology for working on the project:
Planning period
Project work begins with a discussion of the topic
That is, participants in the project process will have an exchange of views, the first forecasts will be considered
To bring the flow of opinions into one system, use the method of attacking the brain
When choosing a topic, the teacher raises an important question for students, analyzing each opinion and determining the topic of the project
Evaluation period
At this stage, students collect information related to the topic in which they work independently, exchange information with each other, and specify the materials collected by each member of the group
The method of collecting information is chosen with the help of a teacher: control over the questionnaire, sociological surveys, conducting the practice of working with literature
The teacher only performs the role of observer and conducts consultations in the right places
At this stage, students develop skills in summing up and working in a group, summarizing classification analysis of information comparison
During this period, every student is entitled to
there should be a general journal that records information about who worked on the project, which later becomes effective when evaluating a student by a teacher
Phase III
Summarizing information
Schoolchildren work independently throughout the period
At this stage, the obtained information is summarized and the skills of the knowledge gained during the work on the project are integrated.
Report with conclusion abstract video in the form of newspaper presentation
The teacher at this stage should monitor the correct conclusion of students
Phase IV
Provide Project Result
At this stage, the project concludes that the last result is presented on Wednesday, it is analyzed which result was achieved by students [7]
Thus, the application of the design method in computer science lessons will be aimed at group and individual training
In addition, this method will create conditions for the use of all educational and didactic opportunities
It will allow, firstly, to teach an active and deep method of education, secondly, to act voluntarily, thirdly, to form a method for increasing the level of socialization of students, entering into relations with the group.
Even an unsuccessful project gives great pedagogical results
When analyzing a finished project, the student detects errors by analyzing the algorithm of the developed project, which determines the reason for the failure
All this increases his interest in the new knowledge of the subject
Public self-assessment skills are also being developed
Project Activity Evaluation Parameters:
the substance and relevance of the question;
practical direction and subject of work;
correct selection of research methods and correct processing of the obtained result;
the use of knowledge in other areas of in-depth study;
compliance of the content of the works with the target objectives and the project theme;
reliability of results;
stylistic and linguistic work culture;
sufficiency of bibliography;
activity of each individual participant depending on the level of education;
ability to prove the result with correct actual arguments;
can provide clear answers to questions from outside the project;
aesthetic design of the finished project;
execution of the project results according to the requirements
Project protection evaluation criteria:
the length of the quality of the report - the significance of the result;
speech culture;
efficient use of a predetermined time;
the use of visual aids;
the ability to attract audience attention;
readiness for discussion;
cultural communication with the audience [7]
The design method is reflected in the peculiarities of teaching a subject that occupies an important place in the computer science lesson.
Using this method, students can confirm their theoretical and practical knowledge by working with any additional computer program and form educational and informational competencies.

In science, it is proved that 80% of the knowledge he received loses that day if the student does not record the knowledge he received in the lesson without repeating it on his own.
And the duration of preservation of the remaining 20% will depend on the activity of the level of interest in education
Therefore, through the organization of project actions of students in lessons, you can get the opportunity to fully master their educational materials, form self-work skills and reveal initiative qualities

METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING
INFORMATIZATION OF EDUCATION
Methods of training in the development of informatics method of researching of the traditimic method programmed ed method
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev expressed the opinion in the Address to the People of Kazakhstan that "the country that could not develop knowledge in the XXI century is at an impasse"
The goal of today's education is to educate talented generations of the new century, able to independently use sources of information with a wide range of intelligent thoughts, striving for self-realization, and not only to master knowledge skills.
Today, due to the changes in life, it is proved that society needs creative activity and a creative personality
In this regard, large claims are made against secondary schools
In the process of developing education, the student, engaged in educational activities, gets the opportunity to independently master theoretical thinking
The organization of the child's research and development activities is in the spotlight
To do this, the student is aware that his abilities by this time are not enough to solve the new problem, and is trying to get his education
The lesson will then consist of the following components:
Specific setting of training goals
Consider together ways to solve it
Prove the correctness of the decision
These three have D developmental learning
Main system components created by Davydov [12]
No ready-made sample is issued for setting educational goals for students
The objective will be addressed through internal discussion and synthesis
In recent years, much attention has been paid to the problems of developing schoolchildren
This suggests that the problems of intellectual moral and physical development of students become very relevant in our education
At the same time, one of the principles of transforming education in a modern school is the principle of renewing it as a real developing education
Training methodology for the development of informatics refers to the technology of developmental training
In the 30s, L.
Vygotsky
His main hypothesis - education is not the ultimate goal of education, but just an instrument for the development of schoolchildren
The methodology should be based on the principles of developmental learning and the conceptual principles of cognitive psychology [3]
In our opinion, a methodology for the construction of teaching methods in the development of informatics can be effective, based on a comprehensive balanced consideration of the main factors determining the content of the field of education, namely, a comprehensive analysis taking into account the principles of training in the development of the structure of the studied sphere of personality and the structure of human activity in this field.
The consistent application of this methodology allows us to move from teaching informatics, mainly focused on executive activities, to the formation of a person who knows the ways of creative activity, aimed at becoming a person who can find direction in the conditions of the modern information environment and make consistent decisions and can generate new knowledge.
This approach will make it possible to fully justify the generalized structure of activities in the field of informatics, in contrast to the part that makes up professional knowledge, mainly related to computer science, to solve another current problem [4]
Let us consider in more detail the content of the methods of teaching students in general education schools to develop informatics
We are guided by the following plan of consideration of each method: reference; basic functions; provisions; applications; difference from other methods
In this case, the provisions are formulated based on the invariant structure of the main training tasks:
generation of new knowledge and ways of action;
promotes the active activity of students;
Educational process management;
process and results assessment
Read more about the content of training methods for the development of informatics
Monological training method
The sign of this method is that the teacher orally presents educational material on computer science, drawing facts, etc.
problem	situations	profit	to have
It	method		to apply	When teaching, the performing activity of students prevails: performing control auditions and memorable actions according to the model; monitoring and evaluation of quality of knowledge modernization
The monological method is the reception of the knowledge and skills of students in the course of informatics using audiovisual means in the form of lectures or school lectures to ready conclusions of informatics to students	and	to understand	at level	formation	by appointment	to pupils	Training-based rules for the preparation and content of educational material
system
The main functions of this method can be defined:
Bringing to students the final conclusions of informatics in the form of facts of laws, rules and rules;
deepening of knowledge on organization of repetition and fixation of the previous material;
improving reproductive thinking
When using this method, observe the following rules:
Memorizing or describing a message of educational material to students or explaining it for use in exercises;
selection and application of stimulus methods;
Display a sample action (examples of how to perform a specific action)
monitoring and assessment of knowledge and skills on the quality of modernization of the mastered material of the informatics course
This method represents the activities of students of a copying nature: performing control listening actions according to the model of working with a computer, solving typical calculations, etc.
The monological method should pay particular attention to approaches that enhance its capabilities
That is, here we are talking about approaches to learning, for example, in cases where when discussing errors made by students when performing a task, the teacher requires a sample work or listening.
In all these conditions, first of all, it is necessary to focus on preparing students for the upcoming work on the perception of their game goals in the learning environment.
That is, it is necessary to realize all the possibilities of providing the educational process
Dialog method
The features of this method include: the content of educational material, including educational material on informatics, is carried out in the form of informative interviews, in which students often apply reproductive questions on familiar material
At the same time, the creation of a problematic situation by a teacher may ask a number of problematic questions, but the essence of new concepts and methods of action in this case explains the teacher
The dialogue method is the preparation of educational material with conditioned teaching principles and teacher training
METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING
INFORMATIZATION OF EDUCATION
explaining the material to students; motivate students to participate in setting and solving problems; a system of regulatory rules for the conduct of notifying interviews to enhance their training activities
The functions of this method are:
The disclosure of new concepts and ways of teaching information science through reproductive issues and pre-created problem situations;
intensification of cognitive relations and pushing students to think or practice, formation of skills of their speech communication and independent work;
to teach them ways of collective thought activity
When using this method, remember the following rules:
creating problematic situations during an informative interview (if possible);
involving students in substantiating the hypothesis and proving assumptions in the formulation of the problem;
monitoring and assessment of student activity to participate in reporting interviews and solving problems of computer science education
Dialogue conducted in the lessons of the dialog method in the process of training in informatics (study of new material; synthesis and systematization of knowledge)
During the interview, the teacher brings students to answer questions regarding their knowledge and skills
Their share of educational independence is determined by the number of reproductive issues
When asking questions that require new approaches to new knowledge of new information to give an answer, the teacher responds personally or organizes the training of students using the educational tool and transmits
this method is very dynamic and can be applied at any stage of the computer science lesson, which can go to the heuristic and monological method if necessary
Research method
The main features of this method are: the teacher organizes the independent work of students to master new knowledge, providing students with problem tasks and preparing with them the goals of work
Usually problematic situations arise during the performance of tasks by students, which are often not only theoretical, but also practical (instrumental) in nature (systematization and analysis of information in search of additional facts
The research method is a system of regulatory rules for the preparation of educational material based on the principles of education and the organization by the teacher of independent work of students to master new concepts and methods of action and solve their intellectual and other fields for development
The main functions of this method are:
creativity	to think	and	intellectual	industries	another	generation of components;
Self-development of new knowledge and ways of action by students;
Encouraging students to develop new ways of doing things that they have not previously taught;
formation of the sphere of emotional will
The following provisions should be taken into account when applying these methods:
The teacher shall independently provide students with work to solve the problem of learning, based on the possibility and feasibility of problematic learning;
With the aim of creating a problem situation and solving it, the teacher pushes students to study activities of a search nature;
control and evaluation method of optimal solution of cognitive problems consists in the fact that setting and solving problems of training is carried out according to the ability to contain results and prove its conclusions
The research method when teaching computer science to high school students (as the most complex method) is rarer than the heuristic method, and is used in material understandable to students, which is associated with the performance of practical or theoretical work on computer science
Solving the problems of thematic interdisciplinary (integrative) learning through several lessons of public observation of knowledge in the form of organizing and conducting workshops of laboratory and practical works is used in organizing educational games to solve a single problem by creative groups of students.
Algorithmic method
The main features of this method are: oral leadership of students; display of the sample action and algorithm of its execution (set of rules and regulations); availability of a sample and alogrit service; there will be moments when the algorithms will be prepared by the students themselves
The traditimic method of training is a system of regulatory rules of organization by a teacher, determined by the principles of training, the process of assimilation (assimilation of algorithms) with the indication of algorithms for completing tasks and prescriptions of new knowledge and methods of action
The main functions of this method are:
formation of students "performance according to certain rules and regulations;
organization of laboratory and experimental works on instructions;
developing the ability to independently create new algorithms of activity
When applying this method, the following basic provisions should be observed:
The students are explained in detail how to perform the task;
it indicates the actual execution pattern of the order;
When performing the task, students use the alogritm proposed by the teacher (or develop it themselves);
monitoring and evaluation is carried out in the course of the activity and its results
When using the austrimic method when teaching computer science to high school students, the teacher has the opportunity to demonstrate to students new models of actions that will teach them action algorithms, create them independently, form skills and skills for creating practical performing activities (independently plan it to develop algorithm correction control)
Based on this method, individual abilities of mastering new knowledge and mastering skills are formed
When training in computer science, this method is implemented in the form of an algorithm or tasks performed to find a new algorithm
The basis of the traditimic method is to bring the algorithm of action in the form of a prescription on how to achieve the goals of the upcoming task (what and how to do)
The instruction, depending on the level of development of students, can be summarized briefly or detailed in the form of a question-answer or written instructions using technical means of teaching cards
For example, when performing laboratory and practical work, you can present the following work plan: 1) What is the purpose of the upcoming work? What approach should be studied, what new knowledge should be able to develop? 2) What can we do for this? What to determine in the work? What legality to check? How will be proven and
METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TRAINING

Programmed method
The main features of this method are: machine and machine programming of educational material with asking them questions and tasks for students to learn themselves and how to act
The programmed method is a system of regulatory rules for structuring educational material, determined by the principles of learning, and managing students independently to study it using software pedagogical tools (PPK)
The main functions of this method are:
training management through KPC and technical training tools (MSW);
training in self-monitoring skills;
preparation of training and other programs for the computer; development of individual features
When using this method, observe the following rules:
Training material is structured using KPC
The inclusion of students in the educational service and the delivery of programmed tasks is carried out thanks to new types of work and the provision of the educational process;
monitoring and evaluation is carried out based on the results of execution of programmed tasks
The programmed method in computer science training is gradually used among other methods of training
Thanks to the high technical and didactic capabilities of computers, this method can be used in teaching not only informatics, but also many other educational disciplines and at all stages of classes
The issues of choosing the optimal method of training for the conditions for the application of these methods of training in the training of informatics constitute the most important aspect of teaching
The most important part of teaching is the question of choosing the most effective method of training in computer science
Consider the factors that influence your choice of training methods
M. Babansky
The studies of Makhmutov and others note that the selection and coordination of teaching methods should be guided by the following criteria:
alignment with learning and development goals and objectives;
The subject matter of the lesson corresponds to the content
conformity of students with specific educational opportunities: opportunities of age-related features (physical mental) level of training (developed learning) with class features;
compliance with existing conditions and time allocated for training;
Matching teachers with their capabilities
These opportunities are determined by the level of psychological and pedagogical training with previous practice and methodological training [5-6]
The ratio of content and methods of training of goals and opportunities for achievement of classes is determined
But with different content, the methods can be different, so when choosing methods, all the listed criteria are immediately taken into account
This requires a comprehensive analysis of the educational material and its accessibility for students to learn
Thus, training in the development of informatics contributes to the involvement of schoolchildren in various actions, in the lesson didactic games suggest using teaching methods to develop the creative abilities of logical thinking of the linguistic richness of thinking and thinking of opinions
Studying their actions in daily classes in the educational process with the development of higher knowledge and moral values ​ ​ of students in the search for truth in personal knowledge
specializes in self-evaluation

The article discusses the question of the singularity of the solution and the quadratic integration of a linear system of integral Volterre-Stiltjes equations with two independent variables
The system of equations is studied in a two-dimensional finite region
Differentiation and integration is carried out on strictly growing differential functions
Matrix functions between square and continuous, and nuclei - n × n-dimensional in the area specified by the right side of the system
In the indefinite region, sufficient conditions are established that guarantee the square addition and continuity of the solution of a linear system of integral Volterre-Stiltjes equations with two independent variables
It is indicated that these conditions will be enough for the loneliness of the solution of the system
For this, the Voltaire equation transformation method and the negative quadratic form method are developed.

it is built
A system of linear algebraic equations related to parameters is created, with the detection and replacement of values ​ ​ at the corresponding points included in the extreme and continuous conditions of the constructed solution
For a loaded system of differential equations, the unambiguous determination symbol of linear point-to-point calculation is set in the term of the matrix of the system of linear algebraic equations related to parameters
The article is characterized by an example of solving a linear point-to-point report for a system of assigned differential equations
Fundamental matrix of determination to load equations
Scale reports in many areas, including motion trajectory calculations or studies of oscillatory systems, can be formulated in terms of extreme calculations for various differential equations
Extreme calculations for simple differential equations often appear in applied fields and are widely used in solving various problems of science and technology
The creation of the Pontryagin maximum principle, which led to the solution of two-point extreme calculations, significantly increased interest in the theory of extreme calculations for all differential equations
Currently, the most fully mastered area of ​ ​ third-party reports is the theory of point-to-point extreme reports
In the 80s of the last century, D.
In Zhumabayev's writings [1 2], a parametrization method was proposed for the study and solution of extreme calculations for simple differential equations
Parameter Method Value - Differential
the interval in which the equation is provided
are divided into parts and
bribe with primary accounting parameter is taken into account
A report solution with a parameter is defined as the limit of a series of parameters and pairs of unknown functions
If the parameter consists of a system of linear equations formed through extreme condition matrices and systems of differential equations
a unknown function length
parameter found in intervals
is the decision of the Cauchy report in values
The introduction of the parameter made it possible to assign the conditions of the set of algorithms of the parameterization method in the term of the initial data of the report, while these conditions ensure the presence and loneliness of the investigated solution of the report
The parameterization method made it possible to obtain the conditions of determination of the extreme report for a system of simple differential equations in the term of initial gears and create algorithms for solving it
Extreme calculations for assigned differential equations arise during mathematical modeling of mechanical biological and chemical phenomena
For example, a report on oscillations of a spring loaded with accumulated masses, a report on longitudinal movement of a load suspended from a dynamic thread, a report on rotating oscillations of a thread with mass vibrations, a report on long-term prediction and regulation of ground water level and soil moisture, etc.
And on the development of the theory of assigned equations
Nakhushev's work contributed significantly [34]
The work of Nakhushev and his students made it possible to intensively and systematically study extreme calculations for assigned differential equations
In the works of Ayda-zade there is presented a quantitative method of solving a system of elementary differential equations with initial and undivided multichectic conditions [56]
Approaches to the theory of extreme calculations for differential equations are widely used to study extreme calculations for assigned differential equations
Assigned differential equations and extreme calculations for them are provided in works [3-8]
For the system of differential equations loaded in works [7 8], the parameterization method for solving point-to-point extreme calculations is applied
For a system of differential equations loaded using the parameterization method, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the unambiguous determination of a point-to-point final report are assigned in the term of the initial representations and two-parameter algorithms for solving it are presented.
Currently, for the system of assigned differential equations, extreme calculations are considered as a mathematical model of many phenomena occurring in nature and the environment, and require special studies

The development of new nanomaterials and nanotechnologies is closely linked to the improvement of nanometric scales of device control and the characterization of adective research methods and materials.
The atomic force microscopy (ATM) method in the implementation of such goals has a great future, atomic capabilities will be achieved there
This method has opened up new possibilities for studying the structure and local physical properties of the crystal surface [1-3]
MIO research
The study of solid solutions CdS1-xSex different structures (FE) allows you to control various micro- and nano-structures on their surfaces
Two main homogeneities can be distinguished on the examined crystal surfaces: elongated structures and nano-structures with micro
The latter may have limited or spherical shapes
Local structures with irregular trait and free dimensions on the surface of crystals can also occur
Stretched structures
3 and CdS0
Two types of elongated structure were observed on the surfaces of CE crystals 5, characterized by a variety of periods and a variety of inclined sections (Figure 1 a-c)
The profile for structures whose boundaries range from 90 to 150 nm is shown in Figure 2.
Height of such structure 0
Forms a 4 nm stage system
The structure profile for a structure with a period boundary of 1200-3100 nm is shown in Figure 2.
The profile of the large steps (Figure 2b) can be wavy and symmetrical or, conversely, asymmetric
Amplitude "Wave" will be from 1 to 5 nm
On the surface of the crystal, mergers of the system of two stages with different periods are often observed (Figure 1 c)
On the slopes of some crystals, stairs are formed in the form of rectangular terraces (Figure 1d)
Normal size terraces 500 nm
As with the steps, this structure arose from the small angle between the crystal slope and the crystallographic planes (10) and (11).
In most cases, on the slopes there is a system of unsettled leaves of small size

Local micro- and nano-objects
On the slopes of the variants, in addition to elongated structures associated with crystallographic features of the material, various local nano-objects can be observed
Nanobjects on the slope of Critalla are divided into two groups:
Nanobjects (hexogonal cylindrical) located on the slopes of the versions in series and symmetrical;
Nanoparticles with chaos
Nano-discharge circuit
Nanoparticles located on elongated chains are observed on the 25 KE slope (Figure 3a)
In most cases, the chains are parallel to or at an angle of 450 to the C axis.
The sizes of the nanoparticles forming the chain vary between 50-200 nm, but the sizes of the nanoscale members vary slightly
The minimum distance between the circuits is about 100 nm.
Dual-Mode Systems
in some surface parts of COE 0
An interval of up to 25 is covered by two medium size nanonocrystal systems between 150 and 700 nm (Figure 3b)
Large nanocrystals, as a rule, have the shape of a hexoganal pyramid
In this case, small crystals of large crystals disappear due to diffusion process [2456]
Spherical nanoparticles
On the slope of rectangular terraces (Figure 1-e) there are nanostructures enlarged in Figure 3c
These nanoparticles are annular, of which a spherical segment without gaps

On the slope of some options, chain structures were noticed, parts of which consist of a closed hexagon (4 ab)
Height of the barrier limiting the structure with a horizontal design size of 45 nm - 2 nm
Closed chain structures stabilize through the edges of stairs
On its slope, individual nanostructures with a lateral size of up to 500 nm can be observed (Figure 4 c)
These structures are the first stage of growth of six-pointed nanoparticles
In addition to individual nanoparticles (Figure 4c), cone-shaped structures located in chaos are observed on the slope
Controlled patterns of this arrangement are associated with nano-objects of group a CdS1-xSex symmetrical FE crystals
Nano-objects of arbitrary shape (group b)
There is no correct shape on the slope of the crystal
and nano-objects located in unresolved form
It should be borne in mind that the stairs are covered with nanoscale (Figure 1as) or free-form holes (Figure 1b), which are located in accordance with the features of potential crossability formed by the steps
Nano-object density is maximum near staircase walls
Lateral size of nanorails and slots reaches from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers
From 1200 to 3100 nanometers (figure 2b) are one more reason of an inclination of modulation with the period CdS1-xSex KE
In this case, crystals CdS1-xSex consist of blocks with a hexogonal structure
Modulation with a smooth analogue in operation is provided for vitsinal breggt mirrors GaAs/AlGaAS
In these heterostructures, processes are carried out that inhibit the formation of auxiliary species, along with steps characteristic of vicinal slopes, have parallel bands of periods of 1-4 nm
When examining the CD (Zn) Se lamps of laser structures, we came to the conclusion that the stages are in the voltage location zone
A periodically modified surface has also been observed in quantum systems InGaAsP/InGap
Some authors attribute this type of slope to alternating stress in the volume of the heterostructure both positive and negative
In our case, the bands are arranged parallel to crystallographic growth, that is, cubic layers (ABC) and hexagonal (ABAB) alternate in the crystal CdS1-xSex-1
However, according to X-ray structural studies CdS1-xSex the internal units of CE do not have voltage, so the stress location area should be the boundary of the units
The appearance of nanobjects on earlier slopes was observed with the content of A2B6 samples on the slope of epitaxial layers under atmospheric conditions
Nanoarals have low mechanical resistance and are located along the slope of chaos
The formation of such nanoparticles is associated with a corrosion process affecting 2-3 atomic layers on the surface
Similar processes include the formation of nanoassembles and holes (Figure 1 a-c)
The formation of nanobjects of the controlled group a located on the slope and having hexogonal symmetry is not necessarily associated with the corrosion processes of crystals contained in atmospheric conditions
Most of these nanobjects are located on the slopes A2B6 and A3B5 with quantum dots grown on vicinal crystalline slopes
This paper considers quantum dots with a self-regulating ensemble grown on vicinal crystalline slopes and oriented according to various versions
Self-organization of quantum dots was carried out through coalescence of material
The size distribution and location of quantum dots depends on the direction of the surface relative to crystallographic currents
The location of nanobjects is associated with the features of the potential relief of the slope CdS1-xSex crystal
Nanorals (Figure 1 a-c) and six-pointed closed structures (Figure 4 a) are located along the extreme sides of the ladder, and spherical nanoparticles are located inside the terraces (Figures 1d and 3c)
The distribution in size in the ekimode structure is explained by the features of coalescence of the material common on the modulated slope under the influence of mechanical stresses
Thus CdS1-xSex the study of the specifics of crossing natural faces of CE crystals contains important information about the structure and state of the slope

According to the results of the AKM study, it was established that the surface relief has three main features: modulation of slopes; nanocrystals formed in the last crystal growth step; nanoparticles and holes formed by the corrosion process

Introduction
The concept of "mathematical modeling" has become widespread in the scientific literature, especially in natural and technical scientific literature
Currently, it is impossible not to meet design or design institutions that do not use mathematical modeling in their work
The application of mathematical modeling is widespread in scientific research and its effectiveness is observed in it.
Mathematics modeling is used intensively in economics in history and many other fields of education
Many of the well-known dissertation works in the specialties of natural knowledge and engineering and technical direction are associated with the creation and use of appropriate mathematical modeling
Mathematical modeling over the past year turns into a separate area of ​ ​ knowledge with methods for studying its own objects
Therefore, the study of mathematical modeling will become one of the current problems of its application to the study of physical and mechanical processes and schoolchildren
The purpose of this article is to create a technology for building a mathematical model that studies the quantum system of wick motion
Modeling refers to the process of conducting a model study in order to obtain the necessary information about the object with the replacement of the investigated object with its model
A physical or abstract image of a simulated object that fully reflects the physical properties and characteristics of the object model of interest to the researcher and is convenient for conducting research
The ease of conducting the study is determined by various factors: the ease and accessibility of obtaining information reduces the length of the study and reduces material costs
Modeling is divided into real and abstract
Builds a model that reflects the basic physical properties and characteristics of the simulated object in real modeling
In this case, the physical nature of the model may differ from the object (for example, an electronic model of a mechanical or hydraulic system)

A mathematical model is a collection of mathematical objects that fully reflect the physical properties of physical objects, and the relations between them

The process of constructing mathematical models and their application for analysis and synthesis is called mathematical modeling
Content statement of the report
In quantum physics, electrons in the Coulomb field of the atomic nucleus are considered as moving systems
Electrons will move in the limited region of the nucleus, and protons and neutrons will move in the nuclear field, that is, their movement will be finite
Some properties of electrons and protons and neutrons can be explained by modeling their movements in the potential hole
Therefore, in order to preserve the basic properties of proton and neutron electrons, a report will be made on the receipt of a potential field model and the study of their movement in this field
Conceptual statement of the report
Let's make the following definitions:
Consider an infinitely high potential pit without a single wall
The potential energy of the particles in the univariate potential well shall be produced as follows:
At x  0, the potential energy of the particle will be infinite and its  (x)
wave function is zero
Therefore, we focus on the study of particle motion
x  0 in the area
We denote the I numeral area 0  x  a, and the II numeral x  a region

in the case of
we consider
The state of a particle with E  U0 is called the associated state
The classical fraction with full energy, taking such a value, moves only inside the hole, since the outer zone of the hole for them is legless
Now

we get a system of equations:
Dividing the first equation into the second, we get the following relation
Defines the energy spectrum of particles in this pit
(13) due to the transsendent of the equation, the energy of the particle E cannot be openly obtained
Indicate that the energy spectrum of the particle (13) defined by the equation is discrete, that is, the energy of the particle in the hole is quantized using the graphical method

Thus (13) corresponds to the equation

Qualitative analysis of the report
This graph shows that the energy spectrum of the particle is discrete
With depth of potential pit k0 and a (14) positive equation
on the side of the straight line has a low inclination and a higher point of intersection of the straight line with the sinus-shaped
Thus, more energy levels will be placed in the potential pit
We will find a condition under which at least one energy level will be located in the hole
In this case (14), the coefficient determining the inclination of the straight line on the right of the equation must satisfy the following inequality
From here we get the following
Let's analyze in this regard
Only if this condition is met, the Schrödinger equation for the fraction inside the pit has at least one energy level inside the pit
In this case, the fraction in the pit is in the bound state
(15) potential pit parameters to the left of inequality -
its width and depth U0
turns on and returns stability to the right of inequality
So that the potential pit is not deep or not large in width, inequality is not fulfilled (15)
In this case, the Schrödinger equation for a fraction in a hole has no solution, that is, no energy level is located in the hole
It is well known that in physics there is no related state
For example, between two neutrons or between two protons there is a force of nuclear gravity, but the related state of two neutrons or two protons is absent in nature
Potential forces corresponding to the mutual impact of these particles are quite developed and shallow
The force of mutual action between the proton and the neutron may be greater than the force of interaction between the two protons, but this difference itself is sufficient for the connection between the proton and the neutron
The bound state of the neutron and proton is called Deutron
In the potential pit characterizing the interaction of a proton and a neutron, there is only one energy pit
This indicates that the deuteron is always in the basic state, and it has no excitation
Analysis of report solution for wave function
Analyze the wave function of a given report at x  0
In the I region, that is, in the potential pit, the wave function has the form
this shows that the Schrödinger equation has an oscillatory solution
Of particular interest is the wave function of the II region

and in ascending x decreases exponentially according to the law, and this is in a related state
indicates that the probability of particles outside the potential pit is different from zero

Non-thermal diffusion processes are provided under conditions of different heating rates of ball-shaped models with different diameters

Nodal words: verb sphere diffusion process monothermite kinetics non-thermal
Briefly discuss the mechanism of diffusion processes associated with the decay of crystalline water when heating ceramic materials from natural mud raw materials, for example
According to the current theory of cattiphase processes (reactions) [1] they are regional
(zone) by mechanism
Diffusion processes occurring in connection with the decay of crystalline water are carried out by penetration of thin reaction layers inside at a certain rate, starting first on the outer surface of the samples in connection with the formation of certain necessary conditions (for example, the temperature of the average gas pressure)
And gas substances formed as a result of phase (chemical) transformations (water vapors of carbon dioxide t

Then equation (1) can be written with the following criterion:

The peculiarity of the non-thermal situation is that under the conditions of these processes the effective diffusion coefficient varies depending on the temperature
The dependence of this coefficient on temperature can be characterized by the following definite expression:
where
D0 is a constant value for a given process; E-activation energy; Wg-gas
In practice, the following values for the study type of monothermite dirt

Taking this expression (1) into account, the following kinetic equation can be represented from the equation, which allows to systematically describe the kinetics of non-thermal diffusion processes:

Taking into account these words (5), the equation can be written as follows:
Thus, the kinetics of diffusion mass shooting processes, which takes place when firing spherical samples from monothermite natural mud raw materials using a computer using the above equation (6), has been comprehensively studied by conducting computational practices with the creation of programs in the origin language
Computer computational experiments were conducted under the following conditions:

The value of the relative weight of the contact substance on the surface of the template remains constant U = 0
The kinetics of diffusion processes in monothermite spherical samples was investigated by conducting computational experiments under non-thermal conditions under heating from a temperature of 800 K
As an example of computational practice, the main results are given in Figures 1-5.

Introduction
The movement of planets in the field of attraction of the Sun or the movement of natural and artificial satellites of planets around this planet are independent conditions for the movement of the body in the field of centric symmetric gravitation
Bodies belonging to the solar system (planets natural satellites Artificial Earth satellites comet and t
) refers to a report on a body whose motion as a whole is in mutual gravitational influence
However, a body report can be cited in a two-body report
For example, theoretically, its natural satellite moving around the Earth affects the Moon Sun and other planets
But given that these effects are thousands of times less than the gravitational influence of the Earth, we consider only the gravitational effect of the Earth and the Moon between each other
When solving differential equations that characterize the motion of celestial bodies that form the solar system, digital methods based on electronic computers are used
Before applying the numerical method, there is a need for the dimension of the quantities characterizing the physical phenomenon
Differential equations passed by impairment can be solved compactly using any programming language
Equations of motion of planets
Consider the motion of two material points interacting with each other
For such a system, the Lagrange function is written as [1]:
where ⃗𝑟⃗1 𝑟⃗2 are the radius vectors of the first and second bodies, and U (|𝑟⃗1 − 𝑟⃗2|) -
potential energy of mutual influences of bodies  - gravitational constant
The magnitude of the vector directed from the first body to the second is:
By obtaining the coordinates of the center of mass of the system, we can write the following equation:
(2) and (3) from the equation:
If you put equations (4) and (5) in equation (1), the following equation is obtained:
The following values are entered in this equation:
(7) the value of the equation is the given mass
(6) the equation formally coincides with the Lagrange function for the material point with the moving mass m in the potential field
In this case, the solution of the report on the movement of two material points of mutual attraction is equal to the solution of the report on the moving material point in a potential field created by a fixed point with a mass of 𝑚1 + 𝑚2
If the mass of one of the two bodies in these mutual attractions is many times less than the mass of the other, then the body of large mass lives calmly, we get that the second body moves in its field of attraction
And dependence on 𝑟⃗ (t) characterizes the trajectory of a light body
Otherwise, we find the 𝑟⃗ (t) constraint for the path of the material point moving in the potential field, and, based on equations (4) and (5), we find the 𝑟⃗1 (𝑡) and 𝑟⃗2 (t) constraints for each body
We use the Lagrange equation:
where generalized coordinates - coordinates of 𝑟⃗ radius vector generalized velocities - coordinates of 𝑟⃗̇ vector
For a Cartesian coordinate system, the body motion equation is:
In the case of m2 m1 (Newton's law of world attraction):
𝐿⃗⃗ = [⃗𝑟⃗⃗ × 𝑝⃗]	where 𝑝⃗ = 𝑚𝑟⃗̇	(11)
We know that the vector is perpendicular to the law of maintaining the impulse moment 𝐿⃗⃗ the plane of the trajectory of the moving body in the center force field
Also, the movement of the body limits the conditions for observing mechanical energy:
or
To solve the equations of motion, we obtain a rectangular coordinate system at the beginning of which the center of mass is located (Figure 1)
PHYSICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
Figure 1
Rectangular coordinate system with the center of mass at the origin of the coordinate
(9) the equations of motion are in the selected coordinate system as follows:
With the introduction of the definition 𝑀 = 𝑚1 + 𝑚2 and the reduction of the same terms (13) and (14), we bring the equations to the type of differential equations of the second order:
(15) and (16) solve equations by quantitative method
To do this, first create a decontamination method [23]
If you take the radius of the planet's orbit and the rotation period of its Sun as the unit of measurement of distance and time, then for a body moving in a circle we can enter the following dimensionless variables: X = x/R; Y = y/R; =t/T
For the equations (15) and (16) we write the xX yY t  variables:
When the body moves in a circle, the acceleration value of the centering to the center |𝑅⃗⃗| the radius of the orbit and the velocity |⃗⃗| of the body is connected as follows:
From this we will find the following:
(21) using the expression, you can find the dependence of the period of a body moving in a circular orbit on the radius of the orbit
Movement period
(21) add the expression (22):
Putting the expression (17) and (18), we get a system of equations that is not completely measured:
and (25) from the equations, one can see their versatility, regardless of the periods of motion of the surrounding center of the equations and the radius of the orbit
Therefore, the T2/R3 value in equations (17) and (18) will be common to all bodies moving along a closed trajectory in the gravitational field
This wording once again confirms the implementation of Kepler's third law
When solving differential equations, the radius vector of the body at the initial moment of time at a point with 𝑟⃗ = (𝑅 0), and the velocity of the body is higher than the vertical
directional ⃗⃗ = (0 ) (Figure 2)
Figure 2
(24) and (25) due to the fact that the equations are dimensionless, the first conditions should also be differentiated
𝑟⃗ = 𝜌⃗  𝑅 t =  T, we bring primary conditions into the following look:
where T (23) is defined by
We remind you that to check Kepler's legislation, you do not need to know the quantitative values ​ ​ of the R T M values ​ ​
Because the first dimensionless conditions will be universal
(21) and (23) (27), find non-dimensional velocity:
Therefore, to obtain a non-circular orbit, it is enough to give a velocity other than 2

Floating (ship repair and
examines the state of waterfowl (diving) bodies in the "theory of stability" (theory of resistance)
Based on the concepts of this theory, consider the stability conditions of bodies floating on the surface of water (for example, a ship)
When the vessel deviates from the vertical position, the displacement shape changes, therefore, the state of the descent point of the Archimedes force changes (Figure 1a)
For example, when the vessel rolls to the right, most of the displacement is to the right of the vessel's midline
So the center of pressure (the color point of the Archimedes force) is shifted to the right
The photo shows that after the roll of the vessel, its stability depends on the mutual location of the center of mass and the center of pressure of the vessel
If the point of vertical intersection between the centre of pressure and the middle line of the vessel is above the centre of mass M (metacenter), gravity and the double force of the pushing force return the vessel to vertical recovery (Figure 1 (b))
Therefore, in this case the vessel is in stable equilibrium
Figure 1 - Stable equilibrium of the vessel
- centre of mass of the vessel
- the center of pressure of M - the metacenter
If the metacenter lies below the centre of gravity (Figure 1 (c)), the vessel is in an unstable state and reverses
The stability of the vessel determines the location of the metacenter
If the center of mass is above the center of pressure below the center of gravity of the metacenter, the vessel will turn over
The distance between the center of mass and the metacenter is called the metacentric height
The greater the metacentric height, the more stable the vessel
In order to ensure the stability of sailing vessels, that is, to increase its metacentric height, the lower part of the vessel is aggravated using ballast
Then the center of gravity of the sailing ship will decrease, and the metacenter will increase
And in order to increase the stability of empty cargo ships, their lower holds are filled with ballast [1-3]
Here the question arises how to realize the stability of the vessel
To solve this problem, we will consider a simple model that can describe some of the basic parameters of a particular ship.
Physical simulation under laboratory conditions using a reduced or enlarged copy of a particular object on the basis of many repeated process experiments are compiled and their results are used in drawing up a specific object
In our case, a simple ship model will be considered, reduced by several hundred times
As a model, we obtain a long ruler with a vertical square of a cross section (profile) (Figure 2)
Consider this ruler as the hull of a ship
When examining this body, it is necessary to find a solution to the following question: Under what conditions does the ruler float in the water, as in Figure 2
The transverse dimensions of the ruler are indicated by the letters l and a, and the sunken part is indicated by h
Denote the center of mass of the ruler with points C and the center of mass of its sunken part O
Gravity at point C and Archimedes force from water to point O
PHYSICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
Figure 2 - Floating of the ruler in water
Ruler - from the parity of the water system we write the following equation
Where b and 0 is the density of the ruler and water
Of course, the density of the ruler is less than the density of water, since h  a (body inflection condition)
To determine stability of the considered equilibrium, turn the ruler from the vertical position to the  angle
The water section of the ruler will now be NKLM by trapezoid
with = = we express to KK the size LL or shift of "waterline" by means of a corner of  and corners of KPK:
Thus, when the ruler deviates from equilibrium, the point of incidence of the Archimedes force to the right moves to a new O point, that is, to the center of the mass of the trapezoid
Let's calculate this offset
Draw the XOY coordinates so that the main point coincides with the O point (Figure 3)
Figure 3 - Moment of deviation of the ruler from equilibrium
Trapezoid is considered as a collection of three simple figures
In particular, rectangular PLL and PKK triangles RLMN
In the selected coordinate system, the centers of mass of these shapes (00) (l/3 h/2 + s/3) (-l/3 h/2)
- c/3) defined by points
Considering that the mass of figures is directly proportional to its areas (lh ls/4 and ls/4), we calculate the coordinate of the O point (xu):
With this shift, a double action affects dancing: the point C below is influenced by the gravity of mg, and the point O is affected by the Archimedes force FApx directed up
double force creates counterclockwise torque because the point is to the right of the vertical passing through point C
Graph of the line passing through the specified vertical in the selected coordinate system, since SO = (a - h )/2
Therefore, in order for a O point to be to the right of this line, its coordinates must satisfy the following conditions:
In this equation, we write the coordinates of the point O and the stability condition s = as follows:
tg expression l
Given that the angle of displacement of the Waterline is  very small
things happen
Therefore, the value of c2 in inequality can be excluded
write the last inequality as follows:
considering that
Where  = 0 is the relative density
The equilibrium of the ruler of this inequality
is a condition of stability in the conditions we are looking for
Inequality 
introduces restrictions on l/a parameters
First, consider some independent conditions of the process of swimming in a liquid with a  density of the ruler
If l/a is known, the expression to the right of the inequality is a square with respect to 
will be three members
the three-term discriminant is negative and
inequality is performed for all possible values 
Therefore, if the ratio between l and a is the same as in the lower reaches, then the ruler is always with a flat side and a horizontal side parallel to the surface of the liquid.
Dancing in this situation will be stably equilibrium
In the case of a 0 l/a inequality constraint, 2  0 
Its decision will be 0   1
But these decisions contradict the accounting agreement ( (0; 1)
Therefore, the vertical will not be a stable equilibrium
PHYSICS TRAINING METHODOLOGY
Determination of conditions ensuring stability of waterfowl
To solve the problems in general conditions, we create a mathematical model of the phenomenon and study it using the graphical method
(1) write three terms of inequality as a function and insert its graph into the plane consisting of niches l/a and 
2 -  +		 0	from the equation	= 
find an expression

graphs using (Figure 4)
Figure 4 - Graph characterizing stability of the ruler
This graph is an ellipse and its equation is as follows:
Half of this ellipse, respectively (1/2	)things happen
Values in area outside elliptical line correspond to parameters characterizing stable equilibrium
Ruler of the region (l  a), bounded by the ABEHD contour from below
Responsible for the floating state of the "plane" (cloak)
The area between the sections AB and HD and the ellipse is responsible for the position at which the ruler can sail on both sides
Area related to the inside of the ellipse bounded by the RBHQ loop
corresponds to instabilities when swimming "vertically"
Triangle with curved walls corresponds to instability when sailing from "plane" of VEN ruler
However, the graph in Figure 4 cannot describe in detail the equilibrium state of the ruler in question.
Since the ruler is characterized by two different geometric quantities: l/a - "main" and its inverse value - a/l
They have two points in the graph
(3) the equation has the inverse value of the a/l function due to the l/a function
This inverse function must be entered into the coordinate plane in Figure 4
This function is called an "inversion" function (Figure 5)
Denote the inversion function graph in SBGHP (Figure 5)
These two graphs divide the coordinate plane into three regions
Graphs can clearly determine the parameters of various types of equilibrium of the three zones
In the  of the first zone and in  two regions (yellow zone), the ruler can be in two stable conditions: "flat" and "vertical"
With inversion, points do not exceed the boundaries of this zone
The second zone also consists of two parts:  - the region belongs to the stable part inside the ellipse, and  - to the unstable part (blue zone)
First, we show that "vertical" swimming in  area will be unstable
As we see now, there is an alternative to this instability
Because  each point in the region corresponds to an "inversion" point describing the floating state of the ruler with a "plane" in the  region
Therefore, if the parameters of the ruler lie in two parts of this zone, the ruler stably floats from the "plane"
The third zone ( green zone), bounded by BEHG contours, is located in the zone inside the ellipse, where the ruler is in an unstable equilibrium state
Inversion does not expose points outside this loop
So, the ruler
If inserted from "flat" or "vertical," it is in unstable equilibrium
Figure 5 - Division of planes by graphs characterizing the stability of the ruler into different areas: a and σ - float on two sides;
and - float smoothly; - inclined surge
Conclusion
We studied swimming in the ruler's fluid with a vertical cross section
The results of the study were as follows:
Determined the conditions that ensure the stability of the waterfowl by inversion;
The physical models necessary for the study of the stability of aquatic floating solid bodies have been created;
Due to the fact that the main floating equipment currently has a complex design of ships, they are widely provided in the literature on navigation of technical science [45]

But when moving from a smooth forced motion to a smooth descending motion, the acceleration direction gradually changes and, accordingly, the inertia force (soft impact) changes, which leads to dynamic oscillations and an increase in dynamic load

- monitoring
To improve the quality of education, the theories and taxonomy of knowledge of famous scientists are provided
Certain types of educational activities of teachers used in improving the quality of education of students are given
Provides common task types that can be used at action levels
Diagnostic activities in determining the level of educational achievement of students include the creation of taxonomies based on educational activities
He spoke about the reasons for learning difficulties and the possibility of identifying students' educational achievements for designing appropriate corrective measures
Taxonomy of knowledge of educational activity levels
According to world experience, the socio-economic development of any state depends on the education system and the level of education of citizens of this country.
In this regard, education is a key tool for including Kazakhstan among the most competitive countries in the world
To do this, it is necessary to bring the domestic education system to the level of quality of education, ensuring the competitiveness of the labor market and in the international educational space.
The concept of quality of education is multifaceted, since the choice of quality indicators reflecting the requirements of the standard has become a complex scientific problem
One of the most important indicators from a modern active point of view is the type of activity that they have mastered as a result of training, as well as the level of their mastery.
Thus, this indicator can be considered as an indicator of the quality of education in this field of education
Due to the fact that the main goal of education is to form a person capable of independently learning and developing, the path of transferring theoretical materials in the textbook must be adapted to the self-instruction of students in order to satisfy these goals
The choice of educational activities is based on traditional pedagogical and psychological ideas, distinguishing educational activities as reproductive and creative.
It begins with Vygotsky's research
Development of this idea (V
Shishov et al.
) led researchers to conclude that learning activities need to be divided into three types: reproductive reconstructive and variable
Guzeeva explained that these types of actions correspond to the use of logical operations of independent thinking and modernization of a certain mode of activity to remind facts
The last level allows an individual to successfully work with any information regardless of its main content [1]
The main mechanisms for managing the quality of education in the educational process are the monitoring analysis of the assessment and the comparison of dynamic trends in results
is
The only source of system quality assessment of training in this process is monitoring
Monitoring the quality of students' knowledge is essential if there is no mechanism for simple and clear supervision of the effectiveness of educational activities, then no professional, especially pedagogical activity in modern society is considered so necessary
We are in the same place or learning that there is no progress allows us to competently work on adjusting the educational process
The system of processing and collection of information on the process of learning of educational materials allows students to predict the achieved level of assimilation of each student at any time and predict ways of its further development
It provides the necessary information basis for a decision aimed at achieving certain goals of the system, reflecting the dynamics of the development process [2]
Monitoring is a system for processing and disseminating data on the education system or its individual elements allows you to analyze the state of an object at any time and predict its further development
Knowledge Monitoring - Multilevel
Level 1 - it is individually and independently carried out by the teacher (certain determination of the dynamics of class students in a certain direction)
Level 2 - in-school
Educational development of students is carried out by the administration of the institution (monitoring the dynamics of class development)
Monitoring of criteria defined during the ninety-first half-year
Level 3 - Monitoring the development of educational institutions [3]
One important work in the field of education is proper control over the level of knowledge received by students in subjects
The ability of a student to use theoretical knowledge in the future, which he could responsibly relate to his training, largely depends on the correctness of this stage
To ensure meaningful monitoring, the presentation of the intended end goals of learning through the expected actions of students is insufficient
Also, for goals reflecting the dynamics of the development process, it is necessary to choose a specific taxonomy so that the student learns more complex systems of action
On the need to apply pedagogical monitoring in the formation and development of educational activities
Repkina noted
It requires information about the current training results, the management of the process of creating the educational activity of which in general is the basis for deciding on the design of the educational activity of both the class and the individual student
In order to manage the development of the most productive educational activities of students, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the results when creating a system for monitoring the educational achievements of students in the internal "teacher-student" system [3]
Analyzing the studied taxonomies, it was revealed the need to use taxonomy for educational purposes based on the definition of reproductive reconstructive variable forms of educational activity
With it, it is possible to develop objective diagnostic tools for determining the level of educational achievements
Therefore, data on the results of the performance of schoolchildren's control tasks allow monitoring the knowledge and qualifications of students, as well as predicting possible directions for managing their future educational activities with the timely identification of gaps in the education of students in the educational process
A theory that is another psychological basis of this situation, L

theory of the transition from the region to the zone of "near development"
This transition is carried out by productive actions from the first level, designed only for re-execution of tasks
These four actions raise students to different levels of educational material with the first performance of level tasks
Russian scientist V.
Bespalco called these levels:
first level - "mandatory training" second level - algorithm
third level - heuristic
the fourth level is called reception at creative levels
The following requirements are imposed on the level tasks for a special subject:
Must be set up for training
In the previous lesson, it is necessary to give the opportunity to re-study the newly mastered education without changing it
Tasks must even be life-related for a new theme
In general technical disciplines, such requirements are fulfilled by constructing tasks similar to reports issued at the end of the new topic, and they are intended to approve legislation on the definition of rules issued by students themselves
Special attention is paid to their cognition and interest in compiling such tasks
should be translated
Second level tasks include:
Tasks for adjustment and systematization of materials passed
Tasks when they are changed are similar to previous tasks, but you need to use the first learned knowledge with transformation to complete them.
Tasks leading to such activities: verification tasks that function as feedback of feedback reports with the text t
Tasks to improve students' thinking
They should have cognitive and cognitive significance, taking into account our national characteristics
These are logical reports, rebus and dictionaries
Third level tasks include:
Types of third heuristic level tasks:
study of primary elementary knowledge (directories, directories, definitions on legality), mastered by students on new topics when performing tasks of cognitive search (heuristic) type
) along with improvement and deepening, he must re-learn new knowledge and discover new ones
Eureka! Such work - analysis, synthesis and comparison - requires generalization.
In solving such problems, students face new reports and problematic situations arise
To solve it, the student needs to look for new methods
tasks for the production of visual aids for measuring work in local conditions on the basis of information obtained from life, compilation and independent publication of reports solved by various methods
Tasks that form skills for thinking
Tasks of the fourth creative level:
As a result of the fantasy and active thinking of the life experience gained by schoolchildren and the concepts formed, their personal flexibility is to a certain extent manifested.
substantiation of the theorem (generalization of laws without the help of a teacher without reliance on a textbook) [4]
So, for the first level of stage 3 - tasks for studying the formulas of rules and definitions for the refinement and duplication of theoretical material mastered in 12 stages, and they are evaluated by testing
For high levels - tasks for self-synthesis and systematization of the acquired knowledge for their in-depth development and practical application
Diagnostic measures in determining the level of educational achievements of students in the study of subjects of natural sciences and mathematics can be created through taxonomies based on reproductive reconstructive variable types of educational activities, which identify the causes of learning difficulties and educational achievements of students that affect the design of appropriate corrective measures.
The system of diagnostic approaches should consist of a profitable current flow diagnostics of the development of training data
Diagnostic methods must meet the following requirements: adequacy of execution during objectivity
The diagnostic method is selected on the basis of a three-dimensional matrix of conformity, consisting of a diagnostic tool and diagnostic goals at the stages of classes [5]
Income monitoring will modernize and update learners' knowledge and skills to adjust their level if necessary to absorb new information
Acceptable, applied by dictation or test, before initiating the mastering of a new topic as a means of diagnosing the process of learning in monitoring and adjusting the generalization of the past to solving problems in the lesson to prepare students for mastering new material for input monitoring
Dictation will allow the teacher to receive systematic information about the degree of preparation of the student for the development of new educational material
Upon receipt of the relevant information, the teacher can immediately intervene in the educational process and solve the emerging difficulties in teaching students in order to avoid further gaps
The types of dictation tasks depend on the goals of training when mastering a new material
Ongoing monitoring involves diagnosing the results of the knowledge and ability formation process to determine the causes of student deviations and difficulties from the planned results, which are used after learning new information [6]
To diagnose students' understanding of new information, the following monitoring methods have been established: the task "Put the missing word"
To diagnose the knowledge of students of the algorithms of reproductive variable levels, tasks are used to organize the action of the algorithm
The output monitoring of students' knowledge and skills in determining the level of educational material mastery after mastering the thematic section of the course and its compliance with the planned results is
The conclusion can be drawn from the following series, which includes many tasks for the diagnostic task
They determine the ability of test tasks to solve not only quantitative, but also qualitative exercises, experimental and practical exercises drawings and graphs, the students of which are recommended to work with reference literature

The University has been established and is functioning successfully
Currently, Kazakhstan is tasked with training specialists who can think creatively in the framework of the reform of the higher education system
The State Education Development Programme 2011-2020 will focus on the development of human capital by achieving quality education to ensure sustainable economic development in order to increase the competitiveness of education
In higher education: "
the need for an individual to achieve a high level of quality education in accordance with world educational practices that meet the needs of the labor market for the industrial and innovative development of the country "[1]
The higher school of any state assumes the main responsibility in the formation of the intellectual human resources of the country, necessary for the implementation of the strategy of innovative development as a social institution, since the education of society is a condition for the development of the entire part of the economy
Doctor of Philosophy Professor Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences B.
Yudin noted that "by providing people with the opportunity to obtain high-quality higher education, society also improves the quality of their education and its intellectual potential" [2]
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
During the comprehensive analysis of Nazarbayev's Address to the people of Kazakhstan, Academician G.
Name: "Innovative thinking is a new thinking - a concept that determines the direction of movement," emphasizing that it has three criteria: "new thought (idea) is a new character and a new result" [3]
The issue of training decent specialists for life in the information society, which will allow it to be effectively implemented in a new targeted way and achieve new results, will be transferred to the system of higher professional education
Of these, the burden on pedagogical universities for the training of teachers of secondary schools, which form the fundamental basis of education, prevails
Innovative thinking depends primarily on the level of development of the intellectual potential of the person
The modern world, including Kazakhstan, needs a person who can independently creatively and intellectually develop
The continuity and depth of innovative processes in universities raises the question of the personal and creative development of the future specialist
Provides for the formation of the student's intellectual potential and the search for his new approaches
This action:
create conditions for the development of a person with creative independent social responsibility with high professional competence;
integration of educational and cultural components capable of combining learning with research;
accompany high academic standards and traditions with values ​ ​ as the main values ​ ​ of university culture;
supporting an independent form of preparation for the creation of a creative environment to independently attach importance to education and education;
Involvement in educational and educational practices of knowledge in the field of pedagogical psychology and sociology;
involving the student in the world educational and scientific space to expand and improve the educational programs of the university by familiarizing information technologies with scientific directions and current problems of today;
should be aimed at creating an environment that ensures the formation of an active life approach of the student to the implementation of personal intellectual and creative potential
From these questions there is a need to create an innovative environment that ensures the formation of the intellectual potential of the person
First, we analyze the concept of the intellectual potential of a person
Analysis of the concept of "intellectual potential" requires consideration of the category "intelligence"
Intelligence means the integrity and harmony of visual actions in the brain of the entire set of human mental abilities [4]
It includes a wide range of human culture, and the reflection of the surrounding real world is carried out at various intellectual levels: the correct action (experience) mind (scientific knowledge - written decree) mind (high mental ability shown in integration with the creation of a new type of human activity)
It is characteristic of him to clearly understand the goal and predict the future
Intelligence is the substantive basis of intellectual potential, an "internal" mechanism that predetermines features in the intellectual activity and behavior of an individual, and it provides the possibility of realizing its potential
Therefore, the structure and composition of independent mental experience predefine the nature of the derivation of objective reality in human consciousness, as well as the specifics of intellectual activity [5]
But intelligence allows you to engage only if there is an appropriate education in a person engaged in certain actions, being a function of the brain
A person's intelligence alone cannot guarantee his professional success effective management of social progress, but it serves as a basis for creating a certain base
The formation of a person, the formation of his intellectual potential occurs in the process of interaction between social groups of people and communities
At the same time, the social phenomenon acquires an individual dimension through the realization of social spiritual qualities through intellectual actions
In general, the intellectual potential of a person can be defined as a complex of cognitive capabilities, the realization of which is a condition for the development of the essential forces of the individual and society
The intellectual potential of a person has at least three properties: firstly, he is able to be active; secondly, the consolidation of many people into whole actions as a condition of continuity in any society, namely, a new generation inherits the knowledge and values ​ ​ accumulated as a result of the actions of the previous generation; thirdly, combines all types of actions
Because scientific education in the industrial sphere as a spiritual education
are included in the areas of activity as a mechanism for its direct management
The diversity of the intellectual activity of the individual is observed in the intellectual potential of society, which consists not only of a simple set of personal intelligence, but also includes certain levels of accumulated intelligence that can create a system of social connections and relationships that stimulates the process of realizing the intellectual potential of social groups and communities of the individual.
Thus, the state of public intelligence is directly related to the capabilities of society at work
And this process includes management methods and methods in a certain historical period.

depending on the formation of an innovative culture
What is an innovative culture? It is still difficult to call the stable attitude of researchers to the concept of innovative culture
If we consider human culture as dynamically developing, then it is inherently innovative
Therefore, academician F.
Mikhailovsky Innovation Culture -
"fat-fat" - since by definition of culture, nature indicates nature that produces naturance
In most cases, the term innovative culture has been used in the scientific literature due to insufficient mention of knowledge about business skills necessary for innovation, but the question of how new knowledge interacts with this knowledge affects the structure and inner world of the individual [6]
Consider innovation culture in a broad sense (L
Elisarova) readiness and ability of society as a social phenomenon to innovate in all spheres: management of education and lawfulness of production [7]
The directory "Cultural Studies" on innovative culture gives the following definition: innovative culture is a system of stable norms and approaches characteristic of the socio-cultural community, ensuring the implementation of innovation in various areas of society; is an algorithm and structural model of innovative actions historically adapted to a particular society
The definition of Poskryakov popularizes heuristic value
Innovative culture is considered as knowledge and experience necessary for preparation in order to comprehensively introduce and comprehensively master novelty in all spheres of human life, while preserving the dynamic unity of antiquity and soul in the innovative system
Thus, the component characteristic of an innovative culture is the innovative type of thinking and creativity
Researchers of innovative thinking see emerging contradictions in social relations as a process and creative solution to the latent aspects of social phenomena in order to penetrate the essence of reality surrounding human vision, see their rotating sides and various aspects (C)
Kravchenko)
The ability to manifest socially significant creative activity, defined as the creative capabilities of a creative person, is any particular property of a person; considered as the ability for creative action leading to a new vision of the scientific question (V)
Thus, innovation culture intensifies creative activity, in which a new educational idea is to create innovation
In turn, the creation of innovations that ensure the formation of a cognitive-creative component of intellectual potential is a widespread activity
The development of the intellectual potential of a person depends on his value principles
Innovative culture leads to an active approach to the life of the individual, and also ensures the birth of new images and thoughts in life in the creative processes of their personal achievements
Alekseeva believes that innovative culture is a set of goals and values ​ ​ aimed at changing the life of society and the individual, and a person should allow the group to numerically and qualitatively expand the satisfaction of the needs of society
According to the author, to ensure the material spiritual sufficiency of a person
striving for innovative approaches to work and learning
Lesina considers innovative culture as a prerequisite for qualitative changes in the life activities of people and considers the methodological basis of progress and harmony in all spheres of social activity
In the explanatory dictionary, innovation culture is characterized by the emergence of activities related to innovation and creativity, the desire for rational changes with the value of creative work and invention
Kholodkova considers the innovative culture of man as a sphere of his spiritual life, reflecting the value orientation assigned to the person's abilities in his abilities to norms and patterns of order, ensuring the perception of new ideas, as well as the readiness and ability to accompany novelty in all spheres of life
The results of the analysis of the formation of innovative culture showed that the main values ​ ​ and principles of a person are creative activity focused on the development of innovation, self-realization, aimed at the development of cognitive-creative components of intellectual potential
Thus, the significance of innovative culture in modern sociocultural reality is explained by the fact that it affects the development of personality talent for the formation of intellectual potential
Management, appearing as an objective need to organize the interaction of people in society and having the ability to radically change socialism to influence social processes, developing in the process of cultural evolution, turns into its own superficial intellectual education
Thus, the intellectual potential of a person is the ability of an individual to use qualified methods of assessing quality and have special competencies, as well as creative thinking and the potential of hidden opportunities of experience, accumulated knowledge of intellectual skills and skills
In his management is the influence of giftedness in the formation of the intellectual potential of the individual
It must take place in a specific management environment
In particular, the development of the intellectual potential of the person will be carried out in certain environments
Such an environment in a modern information society is an information educational environment
The information educational environment refers to a system of tools and resources that ensures the implementation of educational activities based on information and communication technologies [8]
The ability to plan their actions of future specialists in the process of training pedagogical specialists, to be able to evaluate their achievements in training and professional development, to develop skills and skills for its analysis is one of the urgent problems facing the today's education system
In implementing this task, it is important to teach the future specialist to create and maintain an electronic portfolio
The electronic portfolio of the future specialist is characterized, firstly, as a collection of personal educational materials accumulated by the student in the process of teaching and the result of his achievements and acquired knowledge, and secondly, as an indicator of the formation of the ability to analyze results that can plan their actions.

Facilitation of portfolio collection showed that the course on selection "Electronic portfolio of the future specialist" can be implemented as part of training
The purpose of the course is to develop practical skills and skills in the field of creation of electronic educational resources of ICT competencies to familiarize themselves with the activities of the educational portfolio and methods of its management based on information and communication technologies
As a result of the course, the student should create his electronic portfolio in one of the network systems and master the methodology of its use and further development
Thus, the information and education environment ensures learning through information and communication technologies
In turn, we believe that this will be the basis for the formation and development of an innovative culture of the intellectual potential of the future specialist based on rationally organized technologies.
The electronic portfolio of the future specialist is one of the indicators of the formation of his intellectual potential

The article will consider the issues of the vocational and pedagogical direction of studying undergraduates at a pedagogical university
The composition of the methodological competencies of future teachers is determined depending on the peculiarities of the teaching methodology in higher educational institutions
The types of methodological activities allowing to form methodological competencies of undergraduates are given
Descriptive indicators of methodological activity for evaluation of formation of each component of methodological competence are indicated
Methodical training of methodical activity of vocational and pedagogical activity
The country's desire to enter the world educational space requires a change in the educational paradigm and the formation of a new national model, improving the quality of training of pedagogical personnel who educate and educate a new generation with a developed culture of worldview and consciousness.
Topical issues of education - improving the quality of professional training, radically updating the scientific and methodological system for providing knowledge, changing the forms and methods of education, eliminating the best educational experience in it and the divergence of needs of modern society, increasing its role in ensuring continuity in the process of improving innovative knowledge and the ability to use modern technology and technologies at a high level
Therefore, one of the important issues of higher education is the creation of a new system of professional orientation for the development of professional qualifications, optimization of the student for the future profession, training of a business and competent specialist
To train such a specialist, it is necessary to intensify the educational process, improve new forms and methods of training
Revitalization of the educational process - consideration of ways of lasting education, creation of opportunities for searching for students with creative thinking, organization of the educational process on a scientific basis and their involvement in the future profession
Currently, one of the current tasks in the Kazakh education system is to improve the methodological training of master's students for future vocational and pedagogical activities
Kazakh National Pedagogical University named after Abay

INFORMATIZATION OF EDUCATION
a new three-level system of pedagogical education is being formed at the university
This process is being introduced into the structure of the university with significant innovations in research work, as well as in the educational process
At the same time, special importance is attached to the approach to the competence of the training organization to provide educational and methodological and information support for modular assembly of educational and methodological complexes
In determining the content of methodological training and its contribution to the formation of professional competence, it is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of the modern stages of the development of school education in the field of informatics, the individualization and differentiation of the main ideas and methods of building school courses at the highest stage of schooling
Future	computer science	teachers	methodical	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	composition is determined by peculiarities of computer science training methodology
The trajectory of methodological training of undergraduates for professional development and obtaining high-quality education in the magistracy	how to build is important to us
one of the tasks
The master's degree includes disciplines that determine the methodological training of students in accordance with the curriculum of the specialty "Methodological aspects of the independent educational and cognitive activity of undergraduates" "Organization of educational and research work on the methodology for teaching informatics" "Methodological foundations for the application of innovative means in teaching informatics" "Modern methods for monitoring and evaluating knowledge from informatics" "Content and technology for creating educational portals"
In addition to these disciplines, programs of pedagogical and research practices are being developed "Methodology for training in informatics at the university" Questions of informatization and training "
All disciplines should be allocated for two years of training and correspond to the methodological activities of the future teacher of informatics at the school, which should be created in accordance with the professional growth of the future teacher in content
The quality of methodological training in the works of many scientific teachers is determined systemically as one of the professional competencies of the teacher
"methodological competence" [1]
In the literature in the field of pedagogy you can find various approaches to methodological activities
Some of them are authors (Yu.
Methodological activity includes methodological work related to improving knowledge in the subject area, work with didactic means with the self-education of a teacher
And methodological activities in the literature in the field of pedagogy are carried out by other authors (B
Usova et al.
) in methodological activities related to teaching a specific subject
In this case, the authors do not consider the features of the methodical and educational activities of the teacher, but
"methodological activity"
The terms "training activity" are used as synonyms [2]
Third look in literature in pedagogy	research scientists (N
Tatur) methodical activity	specifics in the structure of vocational and pedagogical
cites as set [3]
We proceed from the fact that in the future the methodological system of training of informatics teachers will be based on the requirements of the future teacher for the formation of the professional value of personality quality
In order to expand the methodological competence, it is necessary to strengthen the professional skills of master's students to familiarize themselves with various methods and forms of training, as well as to develop skills for translating subject activities into pedagogical activities [4]
It is not allowed to directly monitor the methodological activities of master's students, who during two years of study at the master's school are reflected through the results of methodological design and design
As part of the results of the methodological activities of master's students, for example, methodically prepared educational materials on informatics and programming in various forms of information transmission, working notebooks of methodological recommendations, study guides in which computer educational programs are held, etc.
methodological portfolio
At the same time, the portfolio can be in paper form and in the form of digital information resources
Also, the methodical activity of magistrates can be understood as an independent type of professional activity in the design and assembly of educational manuals that carry out educational activities in individual sections of informatics and its applications
We refer to the methodological activities of magistrates: analysis of educational and program documentation; methodological analysis of educational materials at the basic and professional levels of informatics; planning of the vocational school system; modelling and presentation of training materials in different types of classes; development of training methodology; preparation of types and forms of control; Guidance and evaluation of learners' activities in the classroom; Carrying out the thinking of their activities in preparation for classes and analysis of its results
The prescribed types of methodological activities do not cover many types of methodological training
The development of methodological activities is carried out through the development of methodological competence, which can be formed at certain levels.
In our case, methodological competence is a system of formation of theoretical knowledge in the field of computer science training methodology and a complex of methodological authorities implementing the main pedagogical functions of a computer science teacher [4]
To design a methodology for mastering methodological competencies by means of vocational disciplines of the Department of Mathematical Physics and Informatics of KazUPU named after Abay, we provided for the formation by a group of requirements for future computer science teachers
In general, the level of formation of each component of methodological competence is diagnosed by various procedures and methods of data processing
Now let's focus on the levels of ownership of methodological competencies
The first level of mastery of methodological competence is awareness of the purpose of implementing methodological approaches, understanding its operational composition and implementation according to the presented instructions
Methodological qualifications are formed at this level when teaching disciplines of the vocational training cycle
At the second level, the application of individual methodological approaches to magistrates and complexes in the conditions of their training is demonstrated
Methodological qualifications of this level are studied during pedagogical and research practice
At the third level, the formation of methodological competence is characterized by a change in individual methodological approaches and types of methodological activities in the new subject area
Such translations are carried out on the basis of knowledge of goals and the application of established skills of methodological activity and methodological creativity
The third level is the methodological competence of a teacher-practitioner
This level has not been achieved by all undergraduates, only if someone actively carries out his pedagogical and research activities on the basis of a gymnasium and college
Undergraduates studying in each master's degree that we observed during the experiment

INFORMATIZATION OF EDUCATION
cannot immediately engage in methodological work
The search for rational methodological approaches to the process of training of the first undergraduates provides software for classes with information tools to support the selection of training materials for the creation of teaching aids
Our experience shows that understanding the essence of methodical activity of the training results is a long process, and this is not enough a year
Peculiarities of methodical activity in this interval - a dark description of methodical components in the general structure of vocational and pedagogical activity [5]
The participation of professors, including practitioners, in open classes, the study of the experience of advanced teachers and the understanding of the significance of the influence of methodological developments on the educational achievements of various professional competitions will help to feel the specifics of methodological activities in relation to training activities
The next process will be closely related to the practical work of the undergraduate in the collection of experience in the methodological work of educational organizations
Training will therefore be conducted in close collaboration with the practice base
Undergraduates studying in the master's degree do not all understand the goal of teaching informatics in various professional schools, which cannot independently set the tasks of generalizing and transferring methodological experience during training, do not know the application of differential approaches to learning.
But it is possible to compare the teaching methodology in basic and professional schools only with pedagogical practice
Therefore, the translation of methodological activities from theoretical to practical will be possible only in pedagogical practice, the need to turn the future teacher into an independent type of professional activity is warned
Teaching practice in the magistracy consists of three modules:
teaching and methodological work of undergraduates;
extracurricular work of undergraduates in the discipline;
educational work of undergraduates with students
It is assumed that the teaching and methodological work of undergraduates during practice will have vocational and pedagogical skills (the conduct of planning assembly training services will have a reflection among trainees in the inspection of training kits)
The Master defends his methodological structure with justification of the strategy of his activity and during the analysis of classes in its implementation or with the head of practice from the department, as well as at seminars of the department and at meetings of the methodological association of teachers in the school
The textbooks of the undergraduate on the content and technology of conducting training sessions reflect a certain level of independent search and creative activity
The effectiveness of the technology developed by the master is proved by analyzing the achievements and knowledge of students using various means of diagnosing the quality of education
The results of the undergraduate training work are presented in the form of a report and an analysis of practice
The methodological training of undergraduates turns into professional methodological activity with training in the methods of teaching the methods of the textbook for various areas, etc.

One of the leading places in the mathematical training of future teachers is to determine their relationship with mathematical practice
This is based on a dialectical way to recognize the objective reality of students
Abstraction, which is taught, seems to be an artificial accident, damages its conscious assimilation, if the student does not see the real essence of mathematical concepts in life
The reason for this is now
solving models of practical reports of concern to scientists will require the creation of mathematical theory for the introduction of mathematical concepts in the production of mathematical reports, in most cases without the attention of teachers and students
Therefore, it is advisable to consider questions about what mathematical and methodological knowledge needs to be mastered by students studying at a pedagogical university in order to know the applied directions of the disciplines being read and in what ways a university teacher can carry out vocational and pedagogical training.
At the same time, it is necessary to analyze the methodological conditions arising from the principles of vocational training from the point of view of the applied directions of the course
An important role is played by the motivational (motivational) provision of the work of the educational process and each topic of the course under consideration and forms a stable motivation used in the activities of the future teacher of mathematics, contributing to the optimization of the educational process in the pedagogical educational institution
Motivation is needed not only to teach mathematics courses to students of higher pedagogical school, but also to form the right methodological approach to them
Because during professional activity, the teacher must not only properly transfer knowledge, but also manage the educational process
To do this, it is necessary to form motivation for schoolchildren
Therefore, to introduce a new concept in a pedagogical university, it is necessary to use more and more examples that motivate its natural occurrence from the source
In teaching the course "Questions of separation of differential operators," it is advisable to cite as motivation that differential equations are a model image of certain physical phenomena, that calculations exhibited in functional spaces characterize certain phenomena
At the same time, it is necessary to motivate the formulation of the theorem not only to understand the essence of the theorem, but also to influence the interest of students in mathematics
Because the introduction of a theorem with motivation develops its ability to prove to a student that mathematics is not a set of random conclusions and to think about the theorem
A psychological fact in which the connection of motivation and interest is clarified, "interest easily arises by changing motivation in independent conditions through changing the structure of the action" [1]
A prerequisite for the effectiveness of mathematics teaching at any level is a comprehensive presentation of its content with different views on the same issue.
The structure of the presentation of materials proved in the training of future mathematics teachers should not be two-stage (summary of evidence).
With the introduction of functional spaces into such a structure
Banach used the course of integral and differential calculations [2]
Its propedeutic direction has a certain significance when teaching the course
Propedeutics in pedagogical universities is carried out in two directions: before studying the first definite section, he is presented with a lecture on the main concepts with visual brevity; uses the second mathematical concept at the level of real kinship before presenting it with an exact definition
The first direction sets the goal of the course for the future teacher, summarizes the issues that are solved in this course
The second direction is the formation of a mathematical culture and a dialectical worldview of the future teacher
In the study of mathematics, it is important to choose the level of accuracy from a scientific and methodological point of view.
Future teacher
understand that logical analyses are a sign that individualizes mathematics, have mathematical features of mathematical thinking
Accurate analysis, developed in mathematics, is a mathematical culture
Excessive neglect of mathematics in many cases prevents the development of perception and complete mastery of the material
Inference with naked logical accuracy does not match its internal sequence
This idea is of great importance for the creation of mathematical courses for future teachers
It cannot be assumed that the deductive method of teaching mathematical courses in universities should be leading, this is the only special type of education
Due to the distance of mathematics from the pedagogical justification, it causes it to deviate from the real approach to the subject.
"If mathematics training determines how mathematics arose at a certain level, then there should be room for generalizing plausible thought" [3]
This is especially important for pedagogical universities, because excessive nudity causes double harm to students: firstly, when studying this mathematical course, the idea may form that teaching mathematics for a future teacher in a primary or forced form consists only of "given" - "must be proved"
Education, relying solely on dollars, not relying on feelings (intuition), causes hunger, prompting the student not to believe in his strength
It is the main source of conscious mathematical reality and an important driving impulse of mathematical creativity
Instinct sensation - cannot replace accurate translation, but the latter has readiness and motivation
Therefore, the sensation method is very important as an introduction to new material at any level of education
Only in this case, the future teacher in his personal experience will be able to convey to the consciousness of schoolchildren the dialectical path of knowledge
A graduate of a pedagogical university must make sure that on the example of the personality about which Hadamard spoke, "The goal of mathematical accuracy is to coordinate and legalize the achievements of awareness" [4]
Coordination of the level of accuracy takes on a psychological connotation, different from the methodological and didactic situation of science
This suggests that it is important for a future teacher to know his subject psychologically
Psychological knowledge of discipline in an independent environment consists of a goal set at the audience level; from the fact that the narrative using integrity is conducted at various popular levels while maintaining minimality
In the vocational and pedagogical orientation of the course "Issues of separation of differential operators," its applied directions must comply with all the principles of this course
Mathematical models describing the physical processes of surrounding phenomena solved by the method of differential operators
Their training is important in the professional work of future teachers, that is, in training in modeling work with schoolchildren
Importance of scientific and methodological conditions for the implementation of all principles of vocational and pedagogical education in mathematical courses in pedagogical universities, training of future teachers in mathematical modeling
It is of great importance for the formation of the dialectical materialistic approach of students to worldview
The transition from meaningful and qualitative analyses of an object to slanderous and quantitative analyses is called mathematical modeling of specific processes
Mathematical modeling is the basis of the mathematics of any science and is the basis of the cognitive process, that is, of a scientific nature about the environment.
data acquisition method
Therefore, one of the main problems of school mathematical education is the specific phenomenon or explanation to students of the relationship between the displayed world and its mathematical model.
This allows you to create simple models of life situations in school and understand that abstract mathematical models in which minor and minor details are excluded lead to a complete understanding of the internal meaning of the issues considered
Currently, mathematical modeling is considered as a necessary and important structure of mathematical education
It is taught as a subject in pedagogical universities
Its linkage with information technology and electronic computing techniques will allow future mathematics teachers to further develop knowledge and qualifications in the field of mathematical modeling, using various modern fields of mathematics
The course training methodology equips the future teacher with the methods of teaching and learning to model school students
A math teacher will get a solution to these problems thanks to the processes of building and studying models in order to collect new knowledge of its significance based on a combination of modeling principles in mathematical courses
For this, the teacher of any course of mathematics, using mathematical modeling in solving various problems, must distinguish the following three links of work: hiring (formalization), that is, explaining the results on which a calculation was made within the framework of the theory within which the transition from the specific phenomenon to pairs of models was created, that is, interpreting the solution in the term of the initial specific phenomenon
Here I am
"Training in methods should not be distracted from the citations obtained with it, but the teacher should clearly know where in each case the main direction of efforts" [5]
Here is an example of this course "Differential Operator Separation Issues"
Consider the mathematical model of processes occurring in quantum mechanics, that is, the solution of the Dirac equation in Hilbert space by the method of operators
Then we will show what the solutions for a particular phenomenon will matter
Quantum mechanics is used to study microscopic objects, such as an atomic molecule, as well as processes comparable to the Planck resistance of physical characteristics, with the study of the moment of momentum in autonomous conditions
For macroscopic objects, that is, for the normal scale of objects characterizing classical mechanics, Planck stability will be unlikely
The results of measuring any physical quantity in microobjects have random quantities depending on various factors, and in quantum mechanics the laws of distribution of these quantities are studied
Physical quantities that can be determined in practice are called values to be monitored
It is impossible to determine without a mathematical model some properties of the quantum system, such as the discreteness of the average value of the controlled quantity, the probability characteristic of simultaneous pulse determination and coordinates due to the absence of a certain trajectory of physical particles

The solution of the delivered report can be considered as a wave function in the system of quantum mechanics
He contributes to the description of the system of quantum mechanics and calls the square of its module the amplitude of probability
From the theory of quantum mechanics, it is known that the probability density of finding a partial space at a coordinate point at a certain time point is equal to the square of the absolute value of the wave function of the same state
The wave function found as a solution to the equation is considered as an element of Hilbert space
Thus, experiments conducted in the process of quantum mechanics are consistent with mathematical theory by creating models

There is no doubt that this example will also help in the study of school physics
Teacher of pedagogical university will train future teachers
Therefore, a study of the full nature of modelling with specific physical phenomena is important in future specialization activities.
That is, you cannot think only about education without taking care of activities that cover knowledge
That is, when studying a certain course or subject, one should think about the formation of a general type of cognitive activity based on the values ​ ​ that lie in the totality of independent phenomena about the data studied or the number of skills trained
Therefore, the main direction of the power of a teacher of a pedagogical university is the mathematics of a future teacher of mathematics of a specific mathematical model
specific contribution to understanding pedagogical modeling issues
To its category can be added the improvement of applied directions of the course and interdisciplinary relations, the improvement of polytechnic directions of education
Students should understand that ideas and methods in a specific form contain education, and the activities of students are sufficiently aimed at mastering these ideas and methods.
This will allow at a professional level to form the desire of students to organize the educational process of schoolchildren
Within the framework of this, one cannot fail to mention the cognitive and worldview meaning of the methodological aspects of teaching students mathematical modeling and its solution
What is student mathematics to determine the right direction on methodological issues of mathematical modeling? How does it work and how will it function? Allows you to correctly understand to questions what is the mathematics of knowledge and what is the reason for its achievement on a modern scale
Questions about what mathematics is and what it does in pedagogical universities, when it is important in any universities, have double significance in the theoretical - not only philosophical, but also practical sense
Therefore, mathematics should be carried out in fact, and not only in the fact that it is engaged in mathematical modeling and solving specific processes.
Future mathematics should be aimed at educating teachers in the methods of mathematics and at a high level of thinking, looking through the eyes of a researcher at their educational and professional activities
The only way to solve this problem is the applied training of students of a pedagogical university as an effective method of recognizing objective reality

Calculations for concentration and percentage composition are rich in very interesting qualities and features that enrich students' knowledge of the connection of mathematics with life
However, many issues of how such reports are produced have not yet been given due attention
Therefore, the article classifies reports for concentration and percentage composition
Also, one type of such calculations related to the production of a new mixture with mixing of two mixtures is considered and the method of their release is given, which is not provided for in school textbooks on mathematics
Calculation of estimated concentration and percentage Pearson Envelope
One of the tasks that is most difficult for students when passing an UNT is the calculations related to the production of a new alloy or a new solution with the mixing of any alloys or solutions
Since the curriculum of school mathematics does not pay sufficient attention to the consideration of these types of reports, students understand them as different reports and believe that the ways in which they are issued are different
In fact, their content and corresponding release paths are the same
Therefore, in one word they can be called calculations for concentration and percentage composition
In general, calculations for concentration and percentage composition can be divided into 4 types:
Calculations related to the preparation of a new mixture with the mixing of two mixtures;
Calculations in the mixture of which one of its components is included;
Calculations by which one of its components is separated from the mixture;
Calculation of ratio of components of mixtures [1]
In this article, we look at how to release primary reports
Because additional tutorials containing UNT preparation issues offer the most difficult way for students to understand how to compile these reports
In our opinion, this method has the following drawbacks
Firstly, he takes off the student and takes away a lot of time from him;
Secondly, it requires a student of significant chemical knowledge related to the detection of a mass concentration of a substance;
Thirdly, by this method it is necessary to fill in a more complex table to construct the equation according to the calculation;
Since the equation created in the fourth is related to the calculation of decimal parts, it takes some time to solve it [2]
We believe that this type of report can be quickly derived by the Pearson method
This method was proposed by the outstanding English mathematician Carl Pearson (1857-1936).
Therefore, sometimes it is called the Pearson Envelope or the Cross Rule
Thus, mixture I and mixture II are mixed and a new mixture is obtained.
This can be described schematically (Figure 1):
I	II	New mix
Figure 1
Report model associated with obtaining a new mixture with mixing of two mixtures
Where P1% P2% and Pg% are respectively the weight fraction of a substance in each mixture, and 𝑚1 𝑚2 and 𝑚zh are respectively the weight of each mixture
The total mass of the substance in the new mixture is equal to the sum of the mass of the substance in each mixture:
And since the mass of the new mixture obtained by mixing the two impurities is equal to the sum of their masses, that is, 𝑚1 + 𝑚2 = 𝑚zh
From the last equality
The Pirson method is based on deleting this message
To quickly retrieve this relationship when you create a report, you must proceed as follows:
In line 1, leaving P1-di some place, 𝑚1 is written:
Leaving one path below, the corresponding 𝑃2 and 𝑚2 are written to line 3:
In line 2 𝑃1 to the left and writes 𝑃2-nің the middle 𝑃zh:
Quantity will be between and < >
In it, between and - the difference, and in the middle and - the difference:
- and - align the particles between the difference and (Figure 2):

Now let's try to use this rule for reporting

Based on the properties of the proportions: 5 (x -752) = 9 (920s)

Answer: C)
Copper and moose have two alloys
72% of one copper alloy and 80% of the second copper alloy
How much do you need to take from each alloy to make an alloy weighing 800 g and 75% copper?
Solution:	The mass of the new alloy is 800 g, if we take the mass of alloy I in x g
since alloy II has a mass (800-x) g
That is, 72%	5	x
4000 - 5x = 3x; The 8th = 4000; x = 500
Answer: A)
Weight of the second of two alloys containing copper, more than 3 kg of the first
The percentage of copper in the first alloy is 10%, and in the second 40%
During their melting, a new alloy with a percentage of copper of 30% was obtained
Determination of weight of obtained alloy
Deciphering: mass of alloy I in x kg, where mass of alloy II (x + 3) kg, and mass of obtained alloy (2x + 3) kg
Now create Pearson's envelope:
Therefore, 10 (x + 3) = 20x; 10x = 30;	x = 3
Now you can find the mass of the obtained alloy: 2x + 3 = 2· 3 + 3 = 9
Answer B)
In order to verify the effectiveness of the Pearson method, we offer several reports for release using this method independently
Mixed 400 g of 55% salt solution into 500 g of 10% salt solution
Determination of salt concentration in the mixture
For 4 liters of solution in water 15% of any substance mixed 6 liters of solution in vertical water 25% of this substance
How much percent is the concentration of the resulting solution?
In 15 liters of 10% saline solution, 5% salt solution is mixed and 8% solution is obtained.
How many liters of 5% solution is added?
There are two alloys of copper and tin
The first alloy contains 40% copper in the second 32%
What is the weight of the fused pieces to produce 8 kg of alloy containing 35% copper?
To obtain 95% sulfuric acid, it is necessary to add 100% sulfuric acid per 50 g of 80% sulfuric acid

How much does the mass of the second alloy exceed the mass of the first?
Copper and moose have two alloys
72% of one copper alloy and 80% of the second copper alloy
How much do you need to take from each alloy to make an alloy weighing 800 g and 75% copper?

Consider the following  2 cases:

𝐵 angle is more than angle 𝐶
∠𝐵𝐴𝐴1 = 𝛽 ∠𝐴𝐵𝐴1 = 𝜑 means ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 = 𝛽
Then
prove equality [1]
Angles (that is,) and rest on the chord
In this case, these angles are equal: ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 = ∠𝐴𝐾𝐶 = 𝛽
𝐶𝐴𝐾 in triangle ∠𝐾𝐴𝐶 = 90 ° − 𝛽 = 𝜑
So ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 = ∠𝐴𝐾𝐶zhәne ∠𝐵𝐴𝐴1 =
From the equality of these angles, the similarity of the triangles 𝐴1𝐴𝐵 and 𝐶𝐴𝐾 is obtained.
Now
Take the first two of these relationships:
angles are equal to:
If accept >, then =
So:
Denote the height of the triangle of the points of intersection to the intersection with a pointed circle to it (Figure 5)

Because both of these angles complement the angle of 𝐵 to 90 ° −
Also
both of these angles are equal to half the arc 𝐵𝐴2
If we consider triangle 𝐻𝐴2𝐶 𝐶𝐴1 and height and bisector
In this view
since the points on the triangles and the diameter of the reserved circle lie along the same circle
For 𝐴𝐴1 and 𝐵𝐵1 chords according to the previous proven property, the following equation [2] is fulfilled:

Traditional training methods are used in the training of conceptual geometry machines
Students do not have the opportunity to visually see the material passed only abstractly
Therefore, in the era of the development of modern new information technologies, there is a contradiction between the need to increase the level of knowledge through the training of the conceptual apparatus of geometry to the capabilities of computer technologies and the lack of methods for its application
The revealed contradiction determines the relevance of this article
As a result of the study, it is assumed that in the process of forming educational and cognitive activities of students activating the learning process, which increases interest in knowledge in the formation of conceptual devices of geometry, the identified didactic possibilities of using the capabilities of computer graphics will be clarified.
Axonometric design - 3D objects with a conceptual hardware space of 3ds max
The importance of new technology - in its diversity and nature of coverage of the entire industry
The "information revolution" is based on the rapid growth of microprocessor technology and its technologies at the modern stage, which we have experienced
The information industry, which produces various technologies, from copying machines to telecom, from electronic computers to contact satellites, and modern transformations in society, new strategic guidelines for the development of the economy, the openness of society, its operational awareness and dynamic development radically changed the requirements for education
Intensification of the production process as a result of automation of accelerating the flow of life - knowledge accumulation is three times more - all this A
According to Toffler, this will increase the economic significance of the sent time
From this point of view, educating young people who cannot stand the forces of civilization, worthy of the development of science and technology, and providing them with high-quality education at a high level is the main task facing teachers who study
In today's world with advanced technology and automated information, geometry increases its value
Whatever you do in society, the more things that require mastering this discipline
Therefore, the development of the subject of geometry transmitted at school courses with a new approach to it requires the most modern society to look for ways closer to the consciousness of modern schoolchildren
The specificity of geometry is observed not only among mathematical parts, but also among other sciences
It can link the toughest logic to visualization
Significant changes in the social and social life of recent years put many demands on educational institutions
One of these requirements is the formation of the conceptual apparatus of students
School practice shows that the formation of a conceptual apparatus of geometry is a technique that requires constant addition
As you know, students and students in many cases find it difficult to study the subject of geometry among educational disciplines
Because traditional methods of learning are used in the training of conceptual geometry apparatuses
Students do not have the opportunity to visually see the material passed only abstractly
Therefore, in the era of the development of modern new information technologies, there is a contradiction between the need to increase the level of knowledge through the training of the conceptual apparatus of geometry to the capabilities of computer technologies and the lack of methods for its application
The revealed contradiction determines the relevance of the study article
Unfortunately, there are often contradictions towards the concept
School practice shows that the formation of mathematical concepts is a technique that requires constant addition
Nevertheless, we avoid that this issue is not resolved at all
Because many forms of dissertation work are around this topic
The concept is a very complex logical and epistemological category
Firstly, it is the fruit of upper matter; secondly, it reflects the world of reality; thirdly, a generalizing instrument; fourthly, the formation of the concept is closely related to words and symbols
Thus, the highest form of thinking is the "weapon" describing the world of reality
Any concept, including mathematical, arises through the abstraction of essential signs of things that exist in nature
But mathematical concepts, ignoring the exact content of things and phenomena, reflect only general quantitative relations and formal relations to all
Nysanbaev's word
"mathematics studies the features and abstract structure and functions that are the image of subjects, not the subjects themselves"
Complex psychological process of concept formation
The formation of concepts takes place according to the following scheme: feeling (perception) perception understanding (vision) concept
The initial stage of cognition - perception and understanding is called sensual recognition
The perception of things and phenomena in the brain as a whole, when - sensations are reflected in the brain of certain signs of things and phenomena of the outside world
Concept - the upper stage of the emergence of the concept in the mind
Repeating a previously received image of an object directly related to memorizing the concept
Traces previously preserved as a result of outbreaks in the cerebral cortex are the physiological basis - understanding
The formation of the concept is based on the concept [1]
The absence of a common large visual experience can impede the understanding and formation of many geometric concepts
One such concept is space
Currently, in geometry lessons, we limit ourselves to describing space to any examples and reflecting on the board along the coordinate axis
And this makes it unlikely, because the meaning of interpreting space, which is one of the main geometric concepts, requires high requirements
The term "space" is used in science in two different meanings regarding real space and the abstract mathematical space in which we live
In modern mathematics, the space is topologically projective metric Lobachevsky space and t
is divided into different spaces
The formation of spatial concepts of students is always one of the main tasks of teaching school geometry
This is not only its own internal task in mastering the geometry course, but also the training of students
is one of the applied goals needed to prepare socially useful work for future life
Chetverukhin "good spatial vision" to the designer-manufacturer of new machines, a subsoil user researcher designing buildings in modern cities, an architect skillfully operating a surgeon between complex nodes of vessels and nerve fibers, as well as a sculptor to the artist, etc.
"[2]
It is impossible to correctly perceive the three-dimensional world surrounding us without a spatial understanding supported by geometric thinking, and the objects in it and their mutual arrangement
Therefore, the issue of the formation and development of spatial concepts of students before schools is relevant in the time of the developed globalization of modern science and technology, tomorrow's future sovereign country - education that educates today's youth
Issues of formation and development of student concepts do not go without the attention of psychologists and methodologists
The problem of the formation of the concept is the main subject of many dissertation works
However, one problem is the use of computer graphics in space as a tool to form the conceptual apparatus of school geometry
In Mashbits's work "Psychological and Pedagogical Issues of Computerization of Learning": the idea of ​ ​ using a computer in the teaching process arose within the framework of the concept of program training, which is first considered as a technical means of forming a teaching machine service.
Its advantage was seen as an extension of learning individualization opportunities
Mashbits in his aforementioned work: "
It is not only they that require a revision of the pedagogical and psychological rules of the theory of learning.
These theories are related to the fact that a teacher cannot be limited only to explanatory activities, being a methodological tool for designing programs
And the preliminary record concerns the main aspects of the interaction between the teacher and the student and should allow to technologize "[3]
Despite the fact that the issue of the formation and development of spatial understanding of students is in the center of attention of teachers and methodologists, there has not been significant experience in creating and improving the methodology for the formation and development of spatial concepts of students in school
As one of the steps to solve this problem, I propose to use the capabilities of spatial computer graphics, including 3ds max
The development of traditional visualization does not meet modern requirements, so it is necessary to apply new approaches
As a new method, you can obtain the geometry object with computer graphics, including using 3d max
Let's try to give an effective answer to the course of geometry using this program:
3d max displays three-dimensional space according to the entire world coordinate system, since the program is part of the group of three-dimensional computer graphics
That is, we see how the figure is located in the world coordinate system
In the main window, we perform certain actions by placing shapes (perspective window - work zone), and the remaining three windows are called design windows
In Design Windows
we see the design of certain geometric figures on the top right and on the left
At the same time, another convenience of this program is the arrangement of finished geometric simplicity (figures)
Standard simplicity includes the following 10 different objects: Vox (Paralleliped); Cone (Cone); Sphere; GeoSphere (Geosphere); Sulindeg (Cylinder); Tube (Pipeline); Torus (Thor); Pyramid (Pyramid); Teapot (Kettle); Plane
Since the capabilities of the program are very large, we can in any case change the properties of geometric shapes and bring them to the desired state
Once again, all this is done in front of the student, that is, a vision of the figure itself from three-dimensional space, which is emphasized on the board, contributes to the student's rapid perception of the material
The task of each teacher is to make the lesson attractive and interested
The 3ds max program displays three-dimensional space, respectively, students form and develop ideas about it every lesson, since they work with this space directly when working on the program
Let's talk about the possibility of displaying the 3D space of the program without dwelling on its description, since 3ds max is currently one of the most reusable application programs.
3D objects cannot be converted to secondary space
For efficient use of design windows, first of all, it is necessary to imagine before your eyes the difference between the types of design used in the Max environment and their features
The Max center uses two types of design: parallel (axonometric) and centric (perspective)
When creating an axonometric design of 3D objects, its individual points fall into the design plane through parallel rays, and when creating a centric design, the rays come from the corresponding centric point
The axonometric design plane is perpendicular to all design beams, and the centric design plane is perpendicular to only one centric beam
In axonometric design, there is no compression of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the project, and in centric design, all object parameters are compressed
Promising environmental design seems familiar and natural to us, since we see in life all things promising
With this design, the farther from the source, the smaller the size
In parallel design, the object size image is independent of how far away it is from the source
This is convenient, although not always: depending on the exact identification of the size of objects, regardless of the distance they are at
All max objects, as shown in Figures 12, are located in the global [world] (World) coordinate system
Conventionally, in this system, the Z axis is the vertically upward X axis to the right, and the U axis is directed towards the observing person
The windows of the orthographic project Mach - Thor (Top view) Front (Vision than before) Left (Vision left) and so on - the same name depends on the global coordinate system
View the front of the U axis and the direction of the U axis
means
According to this, the axis of consideration of project X in the global coordinate system is three planes passing through the axis of global coordinates by tacit agreement with the planes on which the viewing description projects are located, if the Z axis is directed to the screen perpendicular to the U axis
For Front View and Back View projects, the Top View and Bottom View project will have the XY plane, and the Left and Right Pine View project will have the storage plane [4]

The cells corresponding to the planes in this global coordinate system displayed in the design windows, including Mach
Coordinate planes in a global coordinate system are called Home grids
You can create Girl objects that can be located at any angle of the plane in the Mach global coordinate system
This allows you to create reflection objects in orthographic design in object grids on the plane of parallel coordinates [5]
Teaching many topics of the geometry course with this program is very effective
Take the theme of the parallelepiped, for example
In the traditional educational process, the parallelepiped - "vertical prism with a parallelogram" - is emphasized on the board with comments
There are many problems
Firstly, the geometric figures strikethrough on the board, students cannot accurately imagine
Achieving a visualization level is known to be one of the basic conditions for understanding the course of geometry.
Secondly, teachers emphasize the invisible sides of the body, and not all students can adopt this method
Because, as many teachers and psychologists say, schoolchildren of school age only observe that a certain thing is a subject.
3D max software provides this opportunity
In the course of the above-mentioned traditional training, the teacher emphasizes the invisible sides of some geometric figures, for example, a parallelepiped, through intermittent lines
All body lines are listed in this program (Figure 3)
Display parallelepiped creators
Therefore, we consider effective training of all topics of stereometry department with the help of this program
Given that stereometry itself is a section of geometry that teaches the properties of spatial figures, 3d max would be a visual tool that can hit an exact target
An explanation of the conceptual apparatus of geometry using such methods-approaches would be very effective, since the consciousness of modern schoolchildren has developed in accordance with modern requirements
That is, they are very close to electronic technologies, especially computers
As a result of the formation of the spatial concept of the course of geometry using computer graphics, including 3D graphics, it would be possible to develop the interest of students in the subject and improve the quality of the knowledge they have gained in the subject.
And if in the process of learning geometry, the process of forming and developing geometric concepts is carried out sequentially, then the process of learning geometry can take place efficiently

The issue of displacement of crust - oil in homogeneous layers with active impurities is considered using quantitative methods
Asphalt resin containing mainly viscosity components
provides for production of petroleum products with hard-to-recover water with additives
Therefore, calculations on decomposition of components that prevent oil injection will be considered
To calculate, use the numerical method of the current confirmation
Production of displacement and production wells is controlled; the ratio of oil produced with average irrigation to all reserves is checked; the products produced by the polymer in the mixture and the residual layer
Method is suitable for consideration of calculations on oil displacement with water-soluble polymer, as well as dilution for any period of formation development
Key words: Current confirmation of the current method of oil displacement with active impurities
Let us consider the movement of wells in horizontal-non-uniform layers consisting of formations of different power with different conductivity at linear arrangement
The latter is the decomposition method used, but the calculation is solved by physical variables [12] i.e.
Where:
- Jacobian conversion t - time - pressure
(gravity deviation is not taken into account) c - layer saturation with water - value of mixture in water and oil (i = 1 - indices relative to water i = 2 - relative to oil)
a - amount of impregnated mixture of layer r - amount of impurity per one measuring volume T - temperature m - heated layer K - layer absorption H - layer thickness e - amount of absorbed heat of layer q - value of heat capacity calculated for one layer measurement size
Large	dimension	stages	provided for;	capillarity	pressure	deviation does not take into account tolerance of diffusion mixture and heat capacity [34]
Consideration of both factors (water and mixture) of any period of oil production increase (1) is characterized by the system
But for the sake of clarity, it is envisaged to displace the polymer mixture and do not consider the influence of temperature

Currently, it is not enough to apply only traditional teaching methods
Therefore, it is more profitable to use video to activate the process or provide additional information
Communicates with learners and provides a good understanding of the subject, as the video consists of a set of moving images and sound
The article will discuss the types of videos and programs for recording and suggest algorithms that will help in the creation of the video

Introduction
Today, physics is considered the most common systematically developing natural science
Physics translated from ancient Greek
means "nature"
According to the general meaning, physics studies the laws of the basic (fundamental) relations of nature
Natural science, which determines the change in the state and structure of the world of the subject, in which physical science is the most common and basic [1]
Physics is a theoretical science that reveals the primary laws of nature
Physical theories and methods of physical research in other natural sciences (chemical astronomy biology and t)
b) gives very important results
Physics is considered the theoretical basis of modern technology, in which many industries are formed on the basis of physical discoveries: electrical engineering and radio engineering, nuclear energy and t.
Physics studies the primary structures of matter and its simplest forms of motion
Thus, he will create a natural science fund for a modern worldview
The significance of a discipline depends on its characteristics and characteristics
Nature science forms the basis of physics in students as a subject of the curriculum of physical education institutions
The system of content and methodology of physics opens up great opportunities for improving practical skills and skills in shaping the scientific worldview of students
When performing tasks, the mental ability of students to work independently develops
Physics plays a big role in training future specialists [2]
The main task of educational institutions is to form a scientific worldview with familiarization of students with the basics of science, improving and comprehensively educating the creative abilities of students
In accordance with modern requirements
training of civilized competitive comprehensively educated specialists with international education
Increasing the competitiveness of learners
The implementation of these tasks is closely linked to the teaching methods and training tools used in the course
The development of society is characterized by rapid development of scientific and technological progress
Improving the quality of education through the effective use of information and communication technologies in a modern sovereign country is the main goal of today
And the main goal of the knowledge informatization system is the formation of an information culture of future professionals who improve the quality of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan using modern achievements of information and communication technologies
The rapid development of scientific and technological progress, together with the development of society, requires the search for new ways and forms of education in the educational system due to certain circumstances encountered in everyday life
Video lecture types
Due to the fact that the 21st century is a time for the development of technology and computer, many information technologies are used in the education system
Including it is important to use videos in educational institutions
Video releases were in the last century during the Soviet era
Video for various fields of science was interesting as cognitive and microfilm
Only at the same time in the process of training due to a shortage of computers
Videos on individual topics were cognitive, but did not have systematics according to the curriculum in educational institutions
Connects with learners and provides a good understanding of the subject, as video consists of a set of moving images and sound [3]
With the help of videos, you can clearly show the material being studied
Its main advantage in accessibility, that is, at any time, allows you to master the topic of interest
There are the following types of video highlights:
Video recording of the doctor
This is a video form with minimal performance and didactically inefficient
Only one person sitting and giving some lectures confuses not only students, but also adults
For example, Alexander Kondakov's lecture on the Federal State Educational Standard [4]
Genuine Record
Uploading lectures given in these institutions of higher education in the reading room
Despite the high quality of such lectures, the student gives the impression that he is in a lesson
Lectures by Massachusetts University of Technology are an example of such videos [5]
Studio Video Releases
Such images will be pre-recorded and well processed
When writing studio videos, many drawings are similar to documentaries using video clips
Interactive Video
Along with the teacher's monologue, tasks are placed on slides of video fragments
The principle of multiple screens is used
The video of the instructor and auxiliary visual material are simultaneously displayed on the monitor
Slide Movies
The video is based on the presentation and is supplemented by personnel comments from the teacher
Video images are used more often than schemas [6]
Tablet Training
A feature of tablet training is the establishment of feedback with the student
A teacher can give a task to a student by conducting a video between themselves
Touch tablet or tablet for this implementation
working with an interactive board
Tablet training is an unusual type of education, if the necessary funds are available
To record 1 2 types of the above video, it is enough to have one camera
This can be done in the most limited period of technology
Preparation is required for processing of 3-5 types of video
You must prepare video segments for preview presentations of image animations
Also, video recording requires a high-quality webcam connected to your computer
Your computer must have dynamic headphones or a microphone to record your voice
Pop filter is recommended with microphone
Pop filter saves extra noise and lecture from recording the student's breath
To record video in the form of tablet training, the above tools are also required
Additional video streaming requires an interactive board or touch computer or laptop
There are a large number of programs used to record video in various directions

Article provides for application of information technologies in electrical engineering lessons
It is indicated that they contribute to the harmonization of the educational process with theory and practice
It was established that information technologies implement issues of professional orientation of future specialists
Methods of application of information technologies for analysis and assembly of electrical installations are provided
It is shown that students and students form skills of self-knowledge and application of acquired knowledge
The ability to apply information technologies in the practice of electrotechnological analysis
The main goal of teaching electrical engineering in special educational institutions is to create skills for analyzing electrical circuits of college students and their formation of skills for assembling electrical installations of a certain purpose
The process of addressing these issues can be greatly simplified with the use of information technologies [1]
Computer designer of electrical circuits - "CROCCLIP3
Let's take a look at how EXE is applied. "
With the help of this program, almost all electrical installations used in everyday life and production can be registered on the site.
The Program working window is given in Figure 1
The main elements that form the electrical circuit and electrical installations on the window instrument panel are: AC DC and pulse current sources; fuse; keys; active and reactive obstacles; transformers; electric motors; lamps; semiconductor means; logical elements; photocells; generators and t
located
We can change their parameters at will
By approaching the reference to any point in the circuit, it is possible to obtain the basic electrical parameters characterizing this means.
Using an electrical probe (transmitter), you can obtain an "oscillogram" of the dependence of voltage (power speed on coordinates) or time at any point in the circuit
Program in English and electrical equipment symbols comply with international requirements
Therefore, anyone with initial knowledge in the field of electro- and magnetism of physics and computer science will easily cope with it.
EXE "will allow you to organize the educational process with a combination of theoretical knowledge and practical flexibility
That is, the issue of career guidance of students will be resolved
The program makes them future professionals, which encourages mentors to learn and increases the effectiveness of the educational process
The program can model real professional activities
One of the problems faced by specialists in the electrical industry is the creation of a plant that converts alternating current to direct current, or the improvement of the existing plant
Such installations are used in welding devices as a current source that feeds semiconductor devices and LEDs and DC motors in battery power supplies, etc.
it is applied
Figure 1
Working window exe
In order to create or improve the above installation, the mentor must know well how each element in the simple electric rectifier functions and how it affects currents [2]
This issue is addressed in two different ways:
Determination of the influence of each next element on currents with gradual compilation of the diagram set by the teacher
Determination of the influence of elements in the finished circuit on the current with gradual removal
If the installation is real, this work will take a very long time
Installation on the computer ("CROCLIP3
EXE ") reduces sketch time by tens of times
Add that a computer sketch can widely change the parameters of electrical components
For example, the transformation coefficient of the transformer in the sketch is easily changed (if the mouse ear has several shertzek), and imagine how much labor and labor it takes a particular transformer to change the transformation coefficient (number of packages)
As an example, consider the analysis of the transformer current correction plant (Figure 2)
Amplitude value of voltage of sketched alternator of domestic current source with voltage of 220 V [2]:
drawing
Installation diagram for transformer electric current correction
Transformer reduces AC voltage by 20 times, sinusoid with voltage amplitude about 8 V at transformer output (Figure 3)
drawing
Dependence on transformer flow time and corrected current
This sinusoidal current-diode bridge resistance is 1 kOhm resistance and is connected to a correction system with a capacity of 10 μF capacitors
Corrected current voltage around 73 V
The dependence of AC current and corrected current voltages on time is transmitted to the oscillograph through probe 1 and probe 2 (Figure 3)
Using the program, you can see the point voltage values ​ ​ of 4 points of any electrical circuit on the oscillograph screen
When analyzing the AC correction unit, the student or student must answer the following questions:
Amplitude value of voltage in the first package of transformer 310 V transformation coefficient k = 20 therefore voltage in the second package
amplitude value 155 V
What is the reason that the amplitude value of the voltage in the second package is only 8 V?
What happens if you remove the diode from the diode bridge or short circuit?
Capacitor capacity increase	to underestimate	or how will its cancellation affect the corrected current?
How does the reduction or closure of the resistance affect the operation of the corrector?
How does the capacitor work and the obstacle in the circuit?
What changes need to be made to the circuit to increase rectifier power?
For what purposes can such correctors be used?
What is the maximum rectifier power (maximum current withstand diode 1
With the help of the program, you can easily find answers to these questions
In Figure 4
graphs of current (top) and current at transformer output (sinusoid with upper spin change) at removal of one of diodes are given
drawing
Vertical voltage values in case of single diode failure
In this case, only one point of the diode bridge works normally, but the amplitude values ​ ​ of the current and corrected current voltages at the output of the transformer increase
The smaller the capacitance of the capacitor, the higher the corrected current voltage
An increase in voltage can disable the capacitor
Approximately direct part of rectified current corresponds to capacitor charging process
In the next six months, the diode bridge will not work
In this case, the value of the current voltage corrected by the capacitor discharge decreases
Our scheme works as a scheme of single diode correction of semi-finished products [3]
Output during analysis of rectifier circuit: to prevent current hopping, capacitor capacity must be at least several hundred μF and withstand voltage several times more than operating voltage
Short circuit of one of the diodes caused it to fail with short circuit and transformer winding
Therefore, a limiting barrier must be connected to the second transformer package.
The diagram of corrected current at the moment of capacitor removal from the circuit in Figure 2 is given in Figure 5
This is a magnifying current in one direction
That is, the capacitor converts the magnifying glass current into a direct current
Figure 5
Corrected current graph in the absence of capacitor
Diodes fail if resistance in correction circuit is reduced
That is, it serves as a limitation of the current passing through the diode
Due to the fact that the obstacle in the correction we are considering is quite large, the output power will be less
Capacitor and obstacle in correcting circuit serve as filter, which together separates direct current from operating lopil current [3]
The question of knowledge and explanation of the activities of each element in the chain encourages learners to systematize knowledge to supplement their theoretical knowledge
A student who answers the above questions in the correct sense can improve it in the future, and some have the ability to make a completely different device.
You can give them the following instructions:
Enter the proofreader in Figure 2 to monitor its performance and parameters
Make a correction scheme without a transformer charging mobile phone batteries
Create a rectifier with enough power to charge car batteries
Application of information technologies for analysis and assembly of electrical installations will help to solve the following pressing issues
These are students and students:
the inability to convert information into knowledge;
unintentional search for information;
lack of systematic knowledge;
low interest in the subject and interest in education
Application of information technology:
Carries out the issue of the professional orientation of future specialists with coordination of the educational process with theory and practice;
future	professional	business	action	truth	sketch	to sit	knowledge	stimulates and increases the efficiency and intensity of the educational process;
allows you to solve issues of the personal direction of the educational process and problematic training

In this work, the cinematic equation bounded by paraboloids was investigated on a surface with a nonholonomic one-way connection of the spatial motion of a solid mounted on a support
At the same time, new restrictions are introduced in the form of kinematic connection, which exclude rotation of the support above the contact point and carried out through a dry force in the contact point of a uniform support and a body protected from vibration
The equation of motion of the body, set on a uniform support, bounded by paraboloids, is obtained in the form of Ferrers, while not taking into account the rotating motion of the body
The resulting system of differential equations is transformed into one differential equation with a complex record

The article provides for the formation of the concept of comparability in the school course of physics
Specified methods for executing motion comparability jobs
Features of relative and absolute values and concepts are defined
The correct description of the interaction of bodies shows the importance of correctly choosing a computer system
Issues of systematization and deepening of knowledge on the comparability of traffic are envisaged
Tasks of computational system systematization on issues of comparability
One of the hard-to-reach concepts in physics is comparability
A comparative result is the results that depend on the control conditions
The results obtained by the controller are valid if he correctly performs his observations and computational actions
But the observer's data on the same phenomenon in another computing system (IC) will also be true, but its data will differ from previous observational data
In this case, we say a comparison of the results and values that will be true in a certain census system
Their description must begin with the definition of IE
Main characteristics and features of mechanical motion - its comparability
For example: "The box on the desk of the cabin does not move
Wording "depends on IE selection
The SD associated with the vessel is in silence, but in the CO motion associated with the Earth
So:
Mechanical movement can only be controlled compared to other bodies
Values characterizing the movement of one body	(speed movement
) may differ in different census systems
Motion and trajectory can also vary across computing systems
Starting from the 7th grade of school physics, the calculation introduces the coordinate system on which the body depends and the clock reference system (time measurement tools)
Pupils of the 9th grade know that one cannot distinguish between calm and normal rectilinear movement
This suggests the principle of relativity Galileo
It follows from the principle of relativity of Galileo that some values ​ ​ (intermediate time intervals), along with the relative relativity of some values ​ ​ (change in speed), are absolute
And if the computing systems are inertial, then the shutdown will be absolute
The principle of comparability is that any inertial IEs of all mechanical phenomena pass by the same law
But the same phenomenon happens in different ways
For example, a body freely thrown inside one normally moving car moves along a parabola relative to the vertical touching the car
Although the laws of movement are the same, the original conditions of movement are different [1]
Kinematics	studied	pupils	mechanical	knowledge about the comparability of motion should be formed correctly
Relativity of mechanical motion and calm;
Trajectory relativity;
The concept of a computational system (a coordinate system and a time measuring tool with which the computational body is associated);
Comparability of coordinates and speed of movement; rules for inclusion of speeds and movements;
Absolute acceleration of inertial IE;
Absolute time interval and distance
The main theoretical materials on mechanical motion are given in the 7th and 9th grades of the school physics course
To improve the accuracy of knowledge about the comparability of mechanical motion, demonstration experiments (comparability of the speed of the path of movement and calm) of electronic textbooks on educational sites on the Internet should be widely used (for example: http ://)
More needs to be done, such as systematizing and deepening knowledge about the comparability of movements and determining physical coordinates and basic kinematic characteristics in different computing systems to build learners' skills to apply their knowledge
These challenges need to be analysed as deeply as possible
Consider one example of how to perform mechanical motion comparability tasks
Fisherman removed a trap from a boat heading against the flow of the river
After 1 minutes, he noticed the loss of a trap and immediately turned the boat
How long will he catch up with the buttock from the moment of loss? If the river has a speed of 2 m/s, then at what distance does the fisherman catch up with the trap from the place of loss? (Boat speed is stable compared to water) [2]
Solution:
approach
Output IEs related to the design location (connected to the controller located on shore at point O)
When launching, the stud must be along a straight line, the projection of which is the point O (the beginning of the coordinate) of the coastal boat and the handle X (Figure 1)
t1 = 1 min boat projection is along straight line with point B and handle projection is along straight line with point C
The fisherman immediately turns the boat back and catches up with the trap after time t2 against the background of a straight line with a projection of point D
For movements of a fisherman and a trap in a census system associated with an observer on shore at point O:
equality will be fulfilled
Here SCS - t1 = movement of fisherman within 1 minutes; SOC - t1 = flow of the sleeve for 1 minutes; SBD - the movement of the fisherman before the turn and expulsion of the trap (this takes time); SCD - trap movement after fisherman turn (at that time time t2 is taken)
(1) linking modules of motion projections taking into account the markup of growth projections X tuned in the direction downstream of the motion vectors in the equation
we get the expression
Figure 1
Movement of IEs connected to the ground of boats and sleeves
Watercourse speed under the contract of account - υ N and the speed of the boat in comparison with water - υ to constant
SR connected with the earth moves with a speed to - υ υ against a waterway as in unit of time the boat moves in relation to water to the distance equal υ C. during whom this unit forces out it in the opposite direction with size equal υ N
For this reason SR speed connected with the earth of the boat moving on a current, υ to + υ therefore (2) of the equation
Follows from this expression that υ k t2 = υ k t1 that is t2 = t1
In other words, the fisherman has the same time to remove from the trap and approach back to the trap
Answer questions raised in the accounting agreement using the information received
easily
Calculated from the date of loss
catches up with time
At the speed of the river brother 2 m/s from the place of loss of the fisherman's trap SOD = SOUND+ SCD = οn t = 2 m/s· 120 s = 240 m
catches up at a distance
approach
Output calculation of IE related to water (related to trap) (Figure 2)
The fisherman is along a straight line, the projection of which is the point O (origin of the coordinate) on X at the initial moment of time
t1 = boat projection when passing 1 minutes is along a straight line having point B
The fisherman immediately turns the boat back and after a while finds a trap in the former place
SCS = T2 = t1 due to the fact that the boat has the same distance from the trap and approaching it and a constant speed of the boat compared to water
SCB = υ to t1 and SPO = υ to t2 therefore t2 = t1 is valid
Figure 2
CP motion associated with boat trap
The time to remove the fisherman from the trap and approach the trap with a turn is the same
Easily answer the questions raised in the accounting agreement using the information received
Calculated from the date of loss
catches up with time
Due to the speed of the uncle of the river 2 m/s, in comparison with the ground, the speed of the trap with the design body is also 2 m/s
Therefore, it refers to the ground behind t = t1 + t2
C = = 2 m/s· 120 s = 240 m moves a distance
When issuing and analyzing such reports, students are convinced that the speed and relative values ​ ​ depending on the IC of the movement, and the time is absolute
The wind perpendicular to the wall presses 200 Pa on it
Air density 129 kg/m3
Find wind speed [3]
This report is intended to apply the Bernoulli Act
In most methodological manuals, wind is considered as the movement of air molecules moving at the same speed in one direction and outputs this report in a generalized way of the basic equation of molecular kinetic theory
The report is presented on the movement of liquids and gases, so air should be considered as an ideal liquid with low density
Under the influence of the wind, the ideal liquid (air) moves towards the wall as a whole and presses on it
The speed of air at a known pressure is not difficult to find using Bernoulli's law
Solution:
We will select IE, since the report provides for movement
Most students choose land-related IP
Let's try to report on this system
Wind gusts in the stenagorizontal direction
hydrostatic pressure in the Bernoulli equation

Therefore (4) the equation is convenient to output a given report
can be written as

whatever happens
Depending on the ideal of air
modulus of wind speed after collision - 2 does not change, i.e.
Pressure on the equation of the obtained velocity values ​ ​ (6)
we determine whether
That is, according to our calculations, the wind does not press on the wall
This is contrary to daily practice
Where's the mistake? The mistake is that we did not take into account the change in speed direction when calculating the pressure on the wall
As a result of the interaction of the wall and wind with a certain force, the wind direction changes to the opposite
Second error by students: some students have additional pressure (4)
hydrostatic pressure in the equation
excluding
determines the speed
Misunderstanding of this physical phenomenon
Select wind-related IE to display the report with correct explanation of wind action on the wall (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Interaction of walls and IE winds associated with wind
Let the wind go to the wall in the same direction to the right X
The MP associated with the wind has a wind speed before colliding with the wall of 1 x = 0, and the projection of the wind speed (air flow) returned outside the wall complies with the rules for switching on the speeds of the previous calculation of 2 x = 2 °
IS chosen by us beats silent air without wind with a speed υ kh = υ
Pressure-inducing impact
Wall pressure drops in X nsi direction
Find it using equation (6)
That is, the pressure lowered on the IE wall associated with the wind
defined by the expression
Absolute value in any inertial computing systems according to the principle of Galileo relativity
Newton's second law with acceleration: the force associated with the equation G = ma is also absolute
And since the pressure is equal to one force and the area is absolute, the pressure will be absolute in all inertial computing systems
That is, the IE pressure associated with the ground is equal to the pressure on the CP associated with the wind
Using the obtained data, it is easy to find the wind speed:
When issuing this report, students are convinced that the inertial IE of the absolute bolt will also be absolute force and pressure
Knowledge of comparability in mechanics students can systematize and summarize by filling in Table 1
Relative and absolute concepts and values of inertial IE
In general, a school in a physics course	To address the correct formation of the concept of comparability, including demonstration experience:
relativity of mechanical motion and calm	in the preparation of kinematics reports and comprehensive analysis;
relative	and the characteristics of absolute values and concepts should be reflected by deriving mechanics calculations in various computing systems;
It should be indicated that when displaying dynamics calculations, it is important to select the IE correctly when correctly describing the interaction of bodies

Microsoft Office Web Apps, based on Microsoft cloud computing, and its features are formulated
Microsoft OneDrive Description
Also online are the characteristics of a number of sites for creating digital education funds
Keywords: educational information society - future teacher Cloud computing Google Docs Microsoft Office Web Apps
The development of information and telecommunications technologies and software for education is accelerating
This, in turn, will have a wide impact on the quick decision of future teachers to form educational funds
However, the preparation of educational funds using programming languages ​ ​ requires complex processes and long financial costs for specialists who have not received special education in this field
At the same time, the information society has achieved a high level of development of information technologies and has influence on almost all parts of society and education
Currently, the number of persons who do not use the services of Internet technologies that do not rely on its activities is at least
The development of the Internet has led to an increase in the volume of electronic information, but cheap average per capita available personal computers cannot meet the requirements of users in the processing and storage of information
The problem here is not only the operational development of information technologies, but also the cost of a system of powerful computers [1]
The solution to this issue is solved by the fact that at present there is a large amount of application software that can be effectively used with the formation of a level of computer literacy, and a number of them are free or free.
Most of the electronic teaching documents developed for educational purposes
developed and presented in tht formats
However, in turn, this is not enough to be of increased interest to students
This is due to the fact that today a large number of higher multimedia digital educational funds are being created instead of text electronic products, which can combine elements of audio-visual animation
At the same time, the optimal software application packages and the expansion of the capabilities of participants in the educational process to create network utilities, easily used by software suppliers, are improved online.

The definition of Cloud computing combines the concepts of information storage and processing, offering us a new concept of Internet funds
Until recently, the Internet was used as a means of creating information and communication (exchange of information)
As a result of the introduction of the Cloud computing concept, the user was able to process and store the document on the Internet itself
In turn, this made it possible to simplify access to a personal computer using free information processing software of various types, preserving a large amount of information in the cloud
Educational funds formed using Cloud computing technology can be effectively used based on activities for optimal organization of the training process
Examples include electronic diaries, electronic journals, personal classrooms of students and teachers, etc.

Also, Cloud computing technology allows you to organize the use of many types of social software and implement mobile training for use in the educational process
Using Cloud computing technology will reduce the cost of training, improve the quality of training by urgently changing curricula and use them together with the formation of educational materials [2 3]
Using Cloud computing in education has the following advantages:
Copy (if your computer fails, your data is stored in the cloud);
Storage (all types of information can be stored in the cloud);
Availability (even for mobile devices with available cloud data);
Collaborative activities (the cloud allows multiple users to work at the same time, with this feature you can optimize the plan of joint actions of students and teachers in classes to create group projects);
Conscious attitude to reserves and time (teachers do not require time and material costs to increase educational materials, and students have access to educational material);
Tasks (students can store their tasks and reports on their performance in the cloud, and it is available to the teacher at any time)
Cloud computing is implemented on the following models:
Storage as a Service (SaaS) - On-Demand Disk Space Service
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - availability of software configured and managed by the provider's employees on remote servers
Platform as a Service (PaaS) - a set of services implemented at the user level in the form of software access for various purposes
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - a set of physical information processing devices (hard disk servers, etc.

The main goal of training modern professionals is to analyze and predict the results of decisions made through scientifically based conclusions through the field of education, form professional qualifications of specialists, create a strategy for solving educational and practical problems, develop their individual and alternative mental abilities, develop in-depth ways of applying professional knowledge
The growth of requirements for the quality of university graduates is the basis of scientific and technical development, leading to changes in the educational process
At present, the achievement of high quality in activities cannot be achieved without making informed and effective decisions and mastering modern knowledge and skills and actions.
Global education reforms aim to improve its development
Development of Kazakhstan's education system will be based on improvement of structure and content of its methodology
Education goes from "life education" to "education for all for life"
This is a natural phenomenon, because education exceeds the boundaries at the state level, research in the field of general specialty and education
Modeling of professional training of future specialists attracted the attention of scientists in the 70s of the last century
The quality of professional training in Talyzin's research is determined depending on the degree of substantiation of three following conditions: the purpose of teaching (for which we teach) the content of training (than we teach) and the principles of organizing the learning process (as we teach); training goal or educational goal - this model [1]
The creation of a specialist model today is an urgent issue, since at present in state professional educational standards it is transferred to the competence of the university to resolve issues related to the content of a large amount of education with a decrease in the number of mandatory components
This is determined for the following reasons:
Standards are drawn up in a specific socio-cultural setting, and their qualifications depend on the time when the standard is drawn up;
the modern world is changing rapidly, so the need to constantly improve and update the content of education in the future to create specific requirements of society and a specialist model is increasing every day [2]
The specialist model is created on the basis of a thorough systematic study of the content and nature of the professional activities of the future specialist and its possible evolution
Communicative potential - the ability to communicate qualities and skills to understand communication [3]
In connection with the questions of research, we must ensure the formation of the communicative potential of the future teacher in the following ways - systemic-effective competence, potentially cultural
The political situation of the state in the field of education should be based on a systematic and effective approach to the creation of a specialist model based on the modern philosophy of vocational education, as well as an analysis of world trends that determine its development
A systematic and efficient approach ensures that the future teacher is trained in a multi-stakeholder, professional-oriented teaching process

The system-effective approach associated with our study is important in that it has the following important features: the presence of a structure - component elements
Educational programs, Educational programs, state educational standards, etc.
; unity - the system is expressed in unity with properties defined in various phenomena regarding the regional education system, and
; interdependence of system components - interaction exchange and
The system-effective approach is based on ensuring that the educational activities of students correspond to the individual characteristics of their age, focusing on their own interests
In this regard, it should be possible to make the necessary adjustments in accordance with the requirements of a flexible society, along with meeting modern requirements aimed at implementing the formation of the communication potential of a future teacher in learning English
Today, the approach to competence extends widely to the training of future specialists
According to Khutorsky, a competent approach is a synthesis of interrelated qualities of a specialist related to a certain range of phenomena and processes for qualitative actions [4]
Analysis of the literature on the use of a competent approach regardless of the similarity of the competent approach in the wording of the different authors "competence"
In addition to the "competence" categories, competence points to the lack and complexity of consistency in defining the approach
Currently, in research works and scientific publications, competence (competence) is used among equal concepts interchangeable with the concepts of competence (competence)
Government Decision No. 1080 of 23 August 2012 on the approval of State mandatory standards for education at the appropriate levels of education presents the following definitions of competence:
competence - the type of educational result of the personal qualities of a child of preschool age, in which the level of educational literacy has developed;
main competencies - a set of abilities for knowledge of skills that allow solving various life problems used in everyday professional or social life situations;
And in the content of the National Framework of Qualifications, approved by Order of the Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated September 28, 2013 No. 444
"competence - the ability to use knowledge and skills in the professional activity of an employee"
The main results of modern education should be determined by a set of highly qualified key competencies in the moral, cultural and legal spheres of intellectual information value of future teachers
A competent approach implies a gradual orientation of knowledge towards a priority educational paradigm in the context of the formation of skills to conclude an agreement on the assimilation of a complex of competencies and sustainable life activities in a modern full-fledged communication and information-economic socio-political multifactorial space [5]
Competent approach defines competencies in UNESCO documents
"the necessary result of education."
The main difference of "competence" from knowledge + abilities + skills (BBD) indicates the interconnected quality of the competent person (BBD + various ways of action) and also that the competence motivated on itself value orientation of the personality, etc.
unites
The category "competence" is considered as a more detailed category than "competence," reflecting the degree of development and development by a person of the relevant competencies
Therefore, "competence"
The meaning of competency categories is deeper than knowledge skills categories [6]
Intercultural communication in a socio-cultural approach gives priority to intercultural dialogue
This approach is considered as the orientation of a foreign language towards the development of communicative integrative abilities for the development of polymodal communication power
Also, the formation of the communicative potential of the future teacher in the study of English and the peculiarities of languages ​ ​ ensure the study of the socio-cultural behavior of a language community
The presence of subjects in the identified sociocultural group in the process of language communication determines, first of all, the choice of thematic language capabilities of verbal or non-verbal interaction
Socio-cultural approach, including in style (business art and household education, technical scientific and economic and
) express emotional connections between speakers and
performs a determination
The discourse also takes into account the attention to language norms in the original and translations arising in relations with socio-cultural agreements, certain features of the organized time and system.
The theoretical studies developed showed the need to determine the communicative potential of a future teacher through a practical study organized on the basis of pedagogical conditions for the formation of English proficiency
The structural model of forming the communicative potential of the future teacher in mastering the English language consists of an interconnected scheme of several components
The goal is one of the most important pedagogical categories
It is positioned as an integrator in a system that defines various elements as a system-forming factor, determining the ways and nature of human actions
The content of the goal is largely determined under the condition of the environment of its implementation
The goal of developing the communication potential of the future teacher in the development of the English language determines the requirements of society for the professional training of the future specialist and the need to manage the implementation of the social order
The full content of the training of a future teacher with higher education is determined by the specific socio-historical conditions of his life.
In shaping the training of future teachers, preference should be given to the following didactic positions: the scientific nature of education includes the correspondence of the development of modern science and technology to the content of education; the humanist position is that human values dominate all others in the humanistic humanism of the professional relations of future teachers; the principle of cooperation - a position that contributes to the achievement of success in the course of active interaction with each other in achieving personal and common goals in joint activities is considered as a type of interaction and joint actions; the democratic position is to determine the goal-interests of self-regulation for the participants in the pedagogical process and find their place
transmissions; The principle of the connection of learning with life and practice contributes to the development of skills to ensure that students can use learned theoretical knowledge in practice and in the field of professional activity; The principle of systematics - the transformation of the structuring of educational material into a single educational process of gradual mastering of individual training conditions by legal information links and processes includes the preparation of a modular experimental educational program, the content of modules and the presence of sequence; continuity and applied direction of learning - includes the relationship of life and theory with practice
Based on these positions, the formation of the communication potential of future teachers will give positive results
The communicative potential of a person according to our wording is the joint activity and integration of a person in relations, characterizing his capabilities in the process of realizing a person in communicative activity; a dynamic system formed under the condition that a person has certain communicative qualities
Based on the above theoretical analyses, it was established that the communicative potential of a person is characterized by its need in relations with communicative activity
Therefore, it can be concluded that the communicative potential of a person is formed in a contract of joint actions with other persons along with the presence of a set of its properties and abilities
Also defined are requirements for socio-ethical competencies for general education, economic and organizational and managerial competencies
And special competencies are determined taking into account the requirements of employers and the social needs of society on the basis of professional standards for each specialty of higher education
That is, the goal of forming the communicative potential of a future teacher is the formation of his communicative potential: understanding knowledge about the meaning and content of the communicative potential; student's desire to form his communicative potential
Along with the conscious recognition of the specificity of their goals in mastering the profession of the future, the connoisseur must be persevere in achieving the chosen goal, realizing how much the set goals correspond to the capabilities and abilities of the individual
Formation of the communication potential of the future teacher is not only an opportunity to predict and develop future professional actions of future teachers, but also the main element of effective planning of professional training of specialists in the context of the introduction of new innovative technologies on the new conditions of reforming the Kazakh education system in the conditions of a higher educational institution
By formulating the above thoughts, it is possible to divide the structure and content of the formation of the communicative potential of the future teacher in mastering the English language into three parts: the main aspects of the socio-professional background of the actions of future teachers are the psychological and pedagogical characteristics of their actions.
The creation of a model for forming the communication potential of a future teacher in learning English should implement the following issues:
analysis of the nature of skills and personal qualities of knowledge in the content and execution of communication actions of the future teacher;
Sound guidelines and criteria for designing the content of communication potential-oriented education should be identified
implementation of communicative knowledge in the organization of the teaching and educational process providing formation of skills and development of communicative qualities of future teacher;
ensuring that the levels of development of the communication potential of the future teacher and his professional potential meet the requirements of the maximum created model;
ensuring the competitiveness of the future teacher in the labor market as a result of the formation of his communication potential in learning English

The article is intended to consider the relationship between uncertainty and risk based on the concept of game theory
A deterministic situation without risk is extremely rare in the economic environment
Unpredictability leads mainly to threats
The article provides an example of making an effective economic decision based on decision-making in a risk environment based on the concept of game theory
When solving the delivered report, a mathematical apparatus is used, on the basis of which calculations are made according to the performance indicator, a G estimation function is created, and a mathematical apparatus is used to find effective strategies according to the selected efficiency criterion.
Based on the concept of game theory, it is concluded that effective decisions can be made in conditions of uncertainty and risk
He indicates that he directly or indirectly takes into account the interest of game participants in the decision-making process
Game Theory - Risk Win Function
In the absence of risk, deterministic cases are extremely rare in the economic environment
Many events cannot be fully predicted, and they themselves pose a threat
In economics and business, in some cases, it is necessary to make decisions based on the construction of a hypothesis system taking into account the chosen goal
This is legal due to the lack of sufficient complete information in personal conditions to overcome uncertainty
And this translates from uncertainty to a risk-risk situation, which in an independent situation can be deviated from the goal, which can be caused by an unreasonable hypothesis, to the risk of incomplete obtaining the expected result.
providing alternative options to test the validity of the hypothesis to calculate the degree of risk and if this is of course possible to circumvent at least some of the possible damage;
it is necessary
Game theory avoids negative consequences from risk
Decision-making in the event of a threat and uncertainty of an economic threat, as well as the relationship between decision-making and risk-based game theory related to the application of game theory in risk management
and t
published several scientific papers
Threats arising from and on the basis of uncertain conflict are based on different concepts
Among them is a fairly studied concept of game theory and statistical solution, widely used in theory and practice
Game theory is uncertainty in a conflict situation when the interest of interested parties (players) or the opposite of opposite parties (in an antagonistic game).
in a game situation with opaque sides) one section of modern mathematics, which reads the mathematical model of decision making in an uneven position
The founders of game theory are American scientists John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern
With the help of mathematics, they described the competitive phenomenon in relation to the market economy as a game
The game is a formal description in a conflict situation with rules that accurately determine the actions of participants seeking to achieve a certain victory on the go by choosing a specific strategy (model)
The decision subject is called the player, and the goal function is called the winning function
Several players can participate in the game and some of them can participate in regular or temporary coalitions among themselves
A game in an organized coalition is called a coalition game
A two-player game is called a double game
Each player makes a decision so that he purposefully or flawlessly loses, that is, chooses a running strategy
Here, the player does not know what strategies another player adheres to
Thus, each player makes their own decision in case of uncertainty, and their chosen strategy depends on the course of all players in the game
The game scheme is used in an economic environment in an uncertain conflict and threats arising from them
This scheme consists of the following components:
the first player is a control subject who selects a strategy on the go, justified in a set of 𝑆 decisions (pure strategies) = (𝑠1 𝑠2... 𝑠𝑚), one of which must be taken;
the second player - he can be in one of the double-costed incompatible conditions that make up the aggregate of the economic environment = (...), and one of them is necessarily fulfilled;
economic environment (which decision the second player makes)
lack of a priori information of the decision-maker that he is in a state;
𝐹 decision subject = (𝑓𝑘𝑗 𝑘 = 1... 𝑚; 𝑗 = 1...) exact value (matrix) of estimated functionality
the element is a quantitative assessment of the effective decision of the activity of the management subject in the case of their choice of strategy = (= 1...; = 1...
The proposed scheme of the simulation process of rational decision making may contain the following interpretation: the second player of the pair can be replaced by a random choice or an economical decision environment, and the decision conditions are characterized by a 𝐹 estimation function called a game matrix (statistical) or a win matrix.
The formal condition of decision-making is characterized threefold (𝑆 Θ 𝐹) by set according to the game-theoretic concept
From a practical point of view, the mixed game model becomes interesting
In the mixed game model, the set of strategies of the subject 𝑆 control is discrete and can take a rational number of options, and the set of conditions [theta] of the economic environment is continuous
Conditions of decision in this case
characterized by a collection of functions
Creative and formal attitude to the creation of a theoretical game model
give a characteristic to the compilers
The main stages of creative components:
forming a set of decisions of the first and second players, that is, a list of pure strategies of the decision subject and the state of the economic environment (nature);
Identification and formation of key performance and utility indicators in the development of a winning matrix;
determination of the existing information situation characterizing the course of the economic environment (identification);
selecting a decision criterion from a set of criteria specific to the identified information situation;
Decision on the combination of clean and mixed strategies according to the selected criterion if it is not possible to use clean and mixed strategies
Uncertainty requires the full development of the formal component, together with the creative component in the decision-making process in the event of conflict and the resulting threat
the use of a mathematical apparatus created on the basis of evaluation functionality and performance calculations, as well as the calculation of a set of effective (rational) strategies or effective (rational) strategies according to the chosen effective criterion are the value of the formal component
The first two stages of the creative component of the decision-making process form the basis of the game model
In the field of production, numerous examples of successful use of game models at the macroeconomic level are known
One of these examples allows you to choose the volume necessary for the sale of products, the so-called "new" and "old" goods
For example, computer brands, such as "new" and "old" goods, during the years of publication of textbooks in libraries of educational institutions in accordance with the fashion for clothes
can be considered
Therefore, we are generally "new" and
"old" items
So that we are aware of the requests for 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 three "old" goods
After a certain time, the retail network will receive three "new" goods 𝑗1 𝑗2 𝑗3, which will be able to exchange the "old" goods
That is, "new" goods will reduce the demand for "old" goods
According to previous demand studies, the probability of selling "old" goods when "new" goods enter the trading network is known
The winning matrix for "new" and "old" items is shown in the following table (Table 1)
Game "new" and "old" items
Consider the conflict situation from the point of view of the first player (participant in the "old" goods)
We define this player as a 𝐴 player for the convenience of ourselves
the player chooses his best strategy, that is, the player (participant in the "new" goods), which from the strategies () of any strategy (= 1 2 3) will be the player's minimum win
(𝑗 = 1 2 3) meets the strategy
To find this strategy 𝐵𝑗, you must find the smallest of the number 𝐴𝑖 in the row according to the strategy 𝑎𝑖𝑗 in the winning matrix
Denote through 𝛼𝑖
Then
- Effective strategy indicator
Thus 𝐴 the analysis for the player can be carried out for the 𝐵 player
We get 𝐵𝑗 ineffective strategy indicator 𝛽𝑗
Values with corresponding performance indicators are given in Table 2:
Game performance indicators "new" and "old" products
Low Game Cost or Maximum Win (Assignment Principle)
high cost or minimum win (minimax principle)
Here
since high cost and low cost of the game are mutually exclusive and maximum strategies, as well as effective strategies of players.
It will be created with 𝑒2 and 𝑗2 minimal strategies
Game Solution 𝑣 = 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 07
Such a strategy is sustainable so that abandoning these strategies is not effective for both players
Thus, the example considered, which allows you to choose the volume necessary for the sale of "new" goods, such as the volume necessary for the sale of "old" goods, will give the maximum economic effect
Conclusion
Based on the concept of game theory, it will be possible to make effective decisions in conditions of uncertainty
It takes into account the interest of various stakeholders
Take into account the interest of all decision-makers who consider any economic situation as a game
The above example of an economic game

This article provides the structure of information systems for the stability of electric power systems
System and functional content of the information system is described
Models of electric power systems are also presented
Currently, the main sectors of the data transmission system application include the relay protection system and automation of dispenser and automatic technological control of electric power facilities, as well as automatic energy accounting systems
Automatic excitation control (ACS) is one of the only effective ways to regulate and maintain stability in the electrical system of the synchronous machine
At the same time, many favorable parameters and stable operating conditions can prevent the creation of stability, being subjected to many obstacles to the power system
In this case, the use of the ATS system will not be sufficient to ensure stability
Therefore, it is necessary to create an information system
Algorithms for calculation of model of information system of stability of electric power systems
Introduction
The electricity system (EEC) plays a very important role in the domestic life of the country, including in industrial transport relations.
The basis for the development of the electric system is included in the FEZ of countless generators, occupying many large lands and entire settlements
This is due to the stability of parallel generators directly included in the power plant to the correct functioning of this system
For example, the United States (ENRON) and Canada operate parallel generators a thousand kilometers away from each other
A similar situation was that the centers of Almatyenergo and Novosibirsk were previously combined through the Ekibastuz energy complex (Ekibastuz GRES 1 and 2)
Modern conditions of mathematical support of automation system control based on UES functional control will grow
Automatic excitation control (ACS) is one of the only effective ways to regulate and maintain stability in the electrical system of the synchronous machine
At the same time, many favorable parameters and stable operating conditions can prevent the creation of stability, being subjected to many obstacles to the power system
In this case, the use of the ATS system will not be sufficient to ensure stability
Therefore, it is necessary to create an information system
Information system of our development in informational form determines indicators of electric power system content in stable state and development of electric power system
Software and technical tool of the information system - automated configuration of the electric power system of the information system of software and hardware, information technological set, which determines the publication and circulation of information processing access to it
Currently optimal for providing data in the area of the main existing system
with the help of dispatching and automatic relay protection and automation (RPA) control technologies, the electric power lens can also be attributed to the automatic energy resource accounting system
Mathematical models of electric power system creation are provided in article [1]
Functional execution of the electric power stability system in the information system is provided in Article [2]
Modular structure of information system activities
Not only in changing or changing modules in the structure of the information system, but also in the development of various models of the EEC and effective approaches to the formation of a new modular system during the expansion development we observe during the development of the information system
The software is carried out mainly by means of a lens of mathematical objectification algorithms and a model algorithm of the transition process
A mathematical object is created on the basis of some mathematical categories and computational lenses with a characteristic value
Based on the object, we often attribute the element of the energy system to vectors and matrices [34]
Each mathematical object shows its own mathematical totality, so they cannot independently perform computational questions only as a decisive means
When implementing classes, methods depend on each data structure, and their virtual use is transferred to the abstract level
In this case, complex organized computing processes using virtual methods are implemented in hierarchies of the highest class by key figures for objects of the base class, class methods are called for objects that are actually reflected by the base class
As computational algorithms of objects, methods of computational mathematics and additional information determining their algorithmic use are understood
Each algorithm is designed to solve one problem, but can be used as a mini-report to solve other reports
The algorithm for modeling a transient process in simple conditions is a sequential scenario for calling computational algorithms and consists of calling algorithms for solving algebraic and differential systems, and also tracks the correctness and efficiency of computational algorithms used in the current calculation situation
In this subject situation, the class system is created on the principle of hierarchical division
Encapsulation properties of object-oriented programming are reflected by elements of the power system and their relationships
Data objects correspond to the concept of subject area and are hierarchically regulated in accordance with the level of allocated abstraction when decomposing the territory
Object operations are stored in an operation container that is a multidisciplinary graph
Contacts in this column display user relations
Fact objects occur as a result of operations to create a specific object and can only be used through the corresponding occurrence options
Classes that work with dynamic structural data, as well as with single and secondary data arrays, are formed in the form of corresponding generalized classes, which allows them to be used in subject modules of the application program [5]
to store feature information
Interfaces of these classes are methods in the form of reboot operators
The dynamic array class stores the value of elements of any size and implements methods to change the sort and ownership of the fill dimension
The vector class takes all properties of dynamic arrays and defines linear algebra operations
The class of secondary matrices additionally implements the calculation of the determinant and obtaining the inverse matrix
Algorithm classes are designed to check the correctness of objects and establish the necessary connections between them, as well as to control the steps of solving the report and determine the sequence of operations [67]
Scripts implement transient calculation algorithms by sequentially calling the virtual methods of the corresponding classes
Diagram of structural-functional algorithm is shown in Figure 1

Standard values of parameters of electrical devices of calculation diagram, design conditions of messages and other data are set in the database
The data set and modes required for the calculation include, in particular, information about the script file, the name of which causes dissatisfaction with the generator and automation of emergency operations

The article presents models of word synthesis and word synthesis
Based on the synthesis of the Kazakh language, effective sides of intonation models are provided
Here is a separate analysis of Insint Fujisaki AM Tilt models for ways to create speech synthesis models
Among these models, the importance of the Fujisaki model for modeling the Kazakh language was noted
Application of new technologies in word synthesis system and preparation of systems for its implementation is very important
Because in this area, new solutions appear every day
The possibilities of successful modeling and creation of devices for word synthesis directly depend on the state of scientific and technical developments in this field
When reviewing modern articles, we will analyze which model is optimal in the process of synthesizing the Kazakh language, considering the effective sides of various models
This fact accelerates the development of word synthesis systems and its wide practical application with an expansion of the level of research in the field of word synthesis
Intsint	model	it is a lot of	language	transcriptions	of the Republic of Kazakhstan in order to ensure intonation
This model is similar to the "neutral theory"	to have	possibly	that is,		to speak		intonations	to create	data	provides raw data with small forms of intonation theory and formation of fund intonation
First, the Intsint model is supposed to be created, such as creating the equivalent of IPA intonation
The main goal of the Incint model allows you to gradually supplement the phonetic transcription of speech without the necessary solutions, that is, the theory or model of intonation is applied sequentially
Incint describes the terms of consecutive speech intonation signs, each of which indicates its own target point
These target points determine by reference a high change in the range of the speaker whose height (T) is average (M) or lower
(B) or reference to the previous target point, where they are noted above (H) Left (S) In the case of a low designation, a reference to the height range of the speaker (L) is determined
Describes the detailed Hirst system and specifies the path that can be used for all major languages
Some algorithms are also designed to automatically derive tags for synthesizing the F0 acoustic and patching circuitry
Veronique considers using this model for synthesis
Tilt and AM Model
The Tilt intonation model developed by Taylor was developed with the specific goal of creating models of practical engineering intonation
Excluded pure linguistics (as well as phonological rules of AM model) or biological reality as Fujisaki model
Tilt's model suggests that intonation as an instrument is not very plausible, but synthesis adheres to its parameters purely linguistically
The Tilt model characterizes indie as a sequence of events without data and to this end reaches the AM model
The main difference is the use of fixed climbing in the category of acceleration height and boundary intonation instead of continuous set parameters
Because Taylor obtained data for individual categories that found a weakness in the AM model [1]
The AM model works in parallel with the oral phonological model
There is phonetic adjacent articulation and acoustic in the oral language, but it is a discrete phonological unit, that is, many AM phoneme models are divided into the same sounds, but Taylor proved that there is no alternative to testing at least a part to determine the distribution path of the phonetic space
In fact, this is an objective test that proves that special languages ​ ​ can be developed in the category
Acceleration and boundary with two different events in the Tilt model (they are also effective as the slope limit and AM model boundaries)
In all accents and boundary forms, changes are regulated, firstly, with respect to the volume of the lift and drop components, and secondly, the event corresponds to verbal components (whether this is mostly high or has an early or late low range slope peak with respect to the impact link)
Then gives a conclusion on six parameters, defines 4 forms of events and describes 2 planes
This basic model (the so-called rise/fall/model link) accurately models the contour, but does not comment on the linguistic interpretation
The Tilt model itself converts the parameters of three Tilts by four parameters for each event (increase and duration of amplitude drop of rise and fall)
The amplitude and duration are as follows:
Duration  D  Drise
The Tilt parameter defines the length and plane, regardless of the amplitude of the overall event shape
To determine its value, we first consider the intermediate value of the Tilt amplitude to be the ratio of the amplitude of rise and fall and the sum of the amplitude of rise and fall:
Do it to continue:
These two values allow you to combine into one closely related parameter Tilt:
Fujisaki Model and Integrated Models
The Fujisaki intonation model gives different applications than the above models, since its purpose is fixed by a clear description of the contour F0, i.e. human
based on the speech mechanism
Fujisaki model developed with filter model proposed by Ohman
Intonation in this model consists of a two-type component phrase and accent
The input model is executed in the form of a pulse, that is, it creates a stress form used to build the phrase format and sequential function
This mechanism consists of two secondary FIR filters
One filter component is used for another accent component
where
Here
Fmin - asymptotic value of main frequency in the absence of command;
- number of voice command;
- number of shock commands;
Ap i is the size i of the sentence command;
the size of the shock command j;
T 0i - team performance time;
j-th start of shock team;
j-th end of the accent command;
- natural angular frequency of the proposal mechanism to the speech command;
j is the angular frequency of the accent command accent mechanism
- components of the maximum accent level of the definition parameter
Based on the Fujisaki model, you should map the F0 contour to its Praad before obtaining a graph using mathematical modeling
Because in the future we have to do comparative testing with the loop schedule F0
The Praad display is shown in Figure 1
Figure 1
In the Praad program, the display of the dubious intonation "Will it come today?"
Mathematicians believe that this is difficult, but the model is almost simple
Each phrase begins with a pulse and after passing the filter increases the loop F0 to the local maximum value and then gradually decreases
Successful phrases of the previous
joins the end
As the phrase temporary constant  has the maximum meaning and
then indicates a rapid decline
Accent starts with a sequential function
When the chain function filter passes, they answer
Unlike a temporary constant accent or where
larger, which responds to the filter in a timely manner
This reaches its maximum value created from accent components, and decreases much faster than the phrase component
The adjusted Fujisaki model is built on flexibility for language modeling, especially Japanese
For example, Van Sander and another presented model simulate the outline of the same phrase and the outline of sound in micro-prosodic smoothing efficiency
This model works with an intuitive or separate F0 loop to model different parts, and then connects them to the word for constructing the last loop, since the superposition principle is effective in itself [12]
Comparison
These intonation models under consideration have advantages and disadvantages
However, when synthesizing the Kazakh language, we can choose the Fujisaki model as the optimal effective model
Because the Fujisaki model is based on natural language synthesis
There are progressive and obvious influences in Kazakh
In Kazakh, words are often found that arise due to the fact that the same sound occurs when affecting another.
The synthesis of these words into the natural voice of a person is convenient, based on this model of Fujisaki
Because depending on the size of the initial elements of the synthesis, it is divided into the following types:
microsegmental (microwave);
allophonic;
diphonic;
fifty;
articular;
synthesis from free units
Usually, such elements are used as a hemisphere - a segment consisting of half consonants and partially adjacent vowels
In this case, the word can be synthesized according to a predetermined text, but it is difficult to control rhythmic characteristics
The quality of such synthesis does not correspond to the quality of the natural word
Because distortions often occur in integrated diphone boundaries
Compiling sound from pre-written speech forms also does not solve the problem of high-quality synthesis of free messages, since acoustic and prosodic (long and rhythmic) characteristics of words change depending on the type of sentence and the place of the sentence inside the sentence
This position does not change when using large memory sizes to preserve word shapes [3]
Despite the great progress of science in this industry, experts say that word synthesis technology is far from perfect and has great shortcomings
These are disadvantages:
literature;
lack of emotional stress;
stability of synthesized word to lower dam
The problem of word formation, despite the voice of the word synthesizer, which seems qualitative to us, is perceived by a person with difficulty
Based on word synthesis technology, a pre-written phonetic base is used, and words are created using a statistical calculation created on the principle of phonetic compatibility regarding maximum reality, and vacancies and shortfalls fill the human brain
That is, a fairly high-quality synthesizer with a well-chosen phonetic base is well perceived in hearing for 15-20 minutes, but after that many cease to perceive the meaning of the word
This is due to the fact that centers for additional processing of the brain are used to listen to the synthesized word and the brain simply gets tired
Thus, the brain does not perceive the synthesized word, which is processed immediately in the vocabulary center as natural
A similar effect was observed by many people when learning a foreign language
The next problem is the lack of emotional burden - the reader's personal perception of the spoken text
When reading a text, a person draws through himself the meaning of what is said and feels that he sounds in rhythms and accents
Modern programs cannot do this, but their predecessors are trying to simulate voice stress by modulating the length of the rhythmic phoneme and pause
But only because it is imitation, the brain gets tired of correcting sound errors, and the listener loses the neck of the message [4]
To solve this problem, methods from the field of artificial intelligence theory will be required to "distinguish meaning" from the voiced text
Therefore, such synthesizers should be created taking into account the results of intermediate order studies.
The third question is the stability of the synthesized word to low resistance
Experiments showed that the synthesizer is enough for the listener to stop taking the meaning of the sounding text
The explanation for this lies in the field of neurophysiology
Due to the fact that the brain of additional centers is used to process the synthesized word, extraneous sounds cannot simply absorb the brain when the listener needs to do a conversation and other work, and the person ceases to understand the meaning of what was said
The effect of obstacles limits the possibility of using synthesizers in specific conditions of man-made and natural balls
The only way to solve such situations is the intonation synthesis of the Kazakh language based on the Fujisaki model

Practice shows the need of society for people who, in the context of the dynamic growth of the socio-political and economic status of the Republic of Kazakhstan, can actively influence the increase in the competitiveness of the state, affecting developing ideas in accordance with real changes that can think of intellectually developed talent
Kazakh society's desire for global educational standards is explained by the strategic goal of reforming the education system, which ensures the creation of favorable conditions for the realization of their intellectual and creative potential for the development of children with established intellectual potential
In this regard, the Republic of Kazakhstan sets the task of training specialists who can think creatively in the framework of the reform of the higher education system
Improving the competitiveness of education for the adopted State Program for the Development of the Education System for 2011-2020 will be aimed at developing human capital by achieving quality knowledge to ensure sustainable economic development
In higher education: "
labour market needs of natural persons
the need to achieve a high level of quality education in accordance with the world practice in the field of education that meets the objectives of industrial and innovative development of the country "[1]
The higher school of any state assumes the main responsibility in the formation of the intellectual human resources of the country, necessary for the implementation of the strategy of innovative development as a social institution, since the education of society is a condition for the development of the entire part of the economy
This question indicates the need to improve the quality of training of specialists through the introduction of innovative technologies in the higher education system
It requires the organization of research activities of students in the educational process based on innovative learning technologies, primarily with a change in the content of teaching special disciplines and learning technologies of means that meet the requirements of today
We are guided primarily by the capabilities of information and communication technologies in introducing innovative technologies and even elements of innovative technologies into the learning process [2]
In this article, we talk about the organization of research activities of students in the process of training future informatics specialists
Research activities of students - elements in the field of a specific scientific discipline aimed at solving the current problem are a combination of relationships and relationships
The difference between academic research activities of students and research activities is characterized by the creation of special conditions for the study of the properties and phenomena of known environmental objects
Training of future specialists in pedagogical universities is not limited only to educational time in the schedule of classes
This question will allow students in the conditions of training with credit technologies to gain deep knowledge of specialties through their independent work
Because the research activities of students ensure their well-being, the formation of the ability to constantly work in various fields of activity
A creative teacher who has developed professional skills organizes the learning process, creating the conditions under which the student independently receives knowledge and skills
He must independently master new knowledge and skills based on previously obtained knowledge and skills, first arousing interest with the student, and then creating the conditions for his mobilization.
Next, you should be able to publicly protect the results and monitor the results of all research actions of the teacher according to the level of knowledge and skills obtained by the student
Currently, we can conditionally classify educational technologies used in the educational process into two groups: traditional and innovative
Traditional technologies accompany the classic learning model (explanatory, illustrative or reproductive)
And innovative technologies are modified technologies caused by traditional technologies taking into account today's educational goals and objectives
This was announced by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
During the comprehensive analysis of Nazarbayev's Address to the people of Kazakhstan, Academician G.
Name: "Innovative thinking is a new thinking - a concept that determines the direction of movement," emphasizing that it has three criteria: "new thought (idea) is a new character and a new result" [3]
Innovation means innovation
Key Innovation Indicator
Progressive initiatives in the development of a school or institution of higher education in comparison with practical and traditional practices
Therefore, innovations in the education system:
content and technology methods and management systems;
style of the organization of pedagogical activity and educational and informative process;
a system of monitoring and evaluation of educational levels; a funding system;
educational and methodological support;
the system of educational work;
curriculum and curricula;
due to changes in the actions of the student and teacher
One of the learning technologies in this direction is the technology of organizing the student's independent educational activities in the context of training by means of information and communication technologies [4]
The activities of the student, organized on the basis of information and communication technologies, are divided into three levels: the first level is the search and protection of information; the second level - conversion and use of analysis of the obtained information; third level - correction and assessment of knowledge developed on the basis of the second level
The result of the student's independent educational activity:
- Positive changes in the student's education, namely the deepening and development of the student's knowledge;
- competencies of students with positive changes in their skills;
- Information materials obtained through information and communication technologies are the electronic portfolio of the student [4]
Next Generation Educational Standards Focus on Interactive Learning Methods
A competent approach is considered as the basis for assessing the quality of education and is based on new generation state educational standards
Professional competence refers to the ability of a specialist to independently qualitatively solve these tasks that have arisen in life and are prepared for the timely solution of professional problems, to evaluate the results
The focus on competence in the new goal of education requires not only changing the content of the disciplines taught, but also changing the methods and types of organization of the educational process, intensifying the activities of students during classes, approaching the topics studied to real life and teaching the ability to find a solution to the issues that have arisen
The term "interactive" means English "interact" ("inter" - "between" and "act" -
"action")
The interactive method can be considered as a "method that allows students to interact"
Interactive learning is considered as a cognitive approach, implemented in the form of joint actions of students [12]
This reflects the essence of an interactive method that characterizes "learning that takes place as the interaction of all students and teachers"
The project method is a learning system that provides students with education and the formation of skills as a result of independent planning of gradually complicated practical tasks
The project is a graphical calculation of search studies performed by students themselves, etc.
set of tasks, including types of works
When working on a project, you can select several stages
The structure and stages of the project as a whole: problem - planning (design) - solution search - product - can be defined as a presentation
Extreme
You can include a portfolio as a section, all materials collected during work on the project are stored in the portfolio
Our research shows that the research activities of students are effectively carried out on the basis of the project method
Research activities of students are based on an individually oriented approach and are based on their active cognitive approach
Reception of information in research activities of students organized on the basis of the project method is carried out on the basis of active interaction on actually performed actions and tasks of project participants
About this C
Rubinstein notes that "learning is research work conducted jointly by a student and a student"
Research activities of students based on the project method can be divided into several stages:
The period of determining the topic of research (project topics) is that the real level of knowledge of students can be presented by the teacher or chosen by the student depending on his independent abilities and interests;
raising the question of research - students analyze the literature corresponding to the chosen topic, identify contradictions and methods of its implementation;
The formulation of the study forecast allows to predict the result of the research work that they will carry out in the future;
synthesis analysis and t
The collection of materials in accordance with the topic of the study is based on the selected topic of the study;
summarizing the processing of the results obtained (it may be a software product or methodological work) and protecting the reporting project in accordance with the results of the study
The structure of research activities of students includes the following sections:
search;
analysis;
assessments;
forecasting the direction of research development;
action
In the organization of research activities of students you can get several types of research
We offer projects for research in our practice
Because the training of future informatics teachers in the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in professional activities should be practically oriented, since the formation of their competencies in ICT is one of the main tasks.
Project topics with high feasibility of research results suitable for future professional activities are proposed as research work
Implementation of the project will be devoted to solving realistic practical problems
Research projects offered to students are the initiators of their research activities
Each student involved in the project can consider his research not only within the proposed subject, but also continue his further course and thesis research
Study of the determination of the level of study of the question of conducting an analysis of the educational and methodological literature related to the question of research and development of a research plan in connection with the question of research and understanding of the question raised by them during the research work
absorbs actions such as the ability to draw conclusions on a study in which the results of the study were summed up, according to which the desire for an appropriate result was made
Also, students engaged in research work and achieved rational results report on the results of the study at scientific conferences or publish in periodicals
Important in the rational organization of research activities of students is the formation of experience in organizing research activities of a teacher
The teacher, feeling like a researcher, should help students build a plan of research work with the accuracy of choosing the topic of research, as well as to focus on them in a timely manner
In organizing the research activities of students, the teacher must carry out the following main tasks:
first, identifying students' propensity for research and helping to choose the topic;
secondly, to arouse interest in the knowledge of the world in understanding the essence of processes and phenomena in real life;
thirdly, the development of the ability and ability to conduct research; fourth, the ability to mobilize students for creative activities; be able to work independently in pentathlon, think creatively
formation of skills;
Of the six, the development of students' abilities for cultural communication with each other when working on the project;
Ensuring that students have access to information that achieves research results in the seventh;
formation of thinking skills and abilities with the wording of the results of the eighth study
Of the listed tasks, the third and eighth tasks are the main
This is an important factor ensuring the success of the research work of the student
This is how the teacher will have the opportunity to conduct a study aimed at reflecting the effectiveness of research on the impact of innovative technologies on the education system to date
This will ensure the development of the intellectual and creative potential of not only the student, but also the teacher
This is the only way to involve students in creativity
Also, students must post the results of the study in an electronic portfolio of information about their research work
What is a portfolio?
Portfolio (portfolio means French "porter" - transportation in folio - "page size") - the technology of working with the student's educational results is used to evaluate the demonstration of the student's educational results
Also, the increase in the level of self-evaluation indicates an understanding of the results of educational activities of the development of reflection
An electronic portfolio is a collection of works over a certain period of time
It can be evaluated in terms of student development or according to curriculum
The use of the portfolio in the educational process ensures the development of the student's skills in working with various educational and professional information, the formation of professional reflections and professional and general cultural competencies
E-portfolio predicts prospects of professional development of self-study skills in organization of student's independent educational activity, determines dynamics of educational activity and studies educational material
provides for identification of difficulties, including mandatory section for research work
Of great importance is the formation of an electronic portfolio as a professional student
Therefore, pedagogical specialists should be included in the collection of a portfolio from the first year
The electronic portfolio accumulated by the student is one of the indicators of his intellectual potential and the formation of research activities

The article will consider the features of teaching object-oriented programming in the process of training future teachers of informatics
The relevance of selecting an object-oriented environment is justified
Adobe Flash is selected as the object-oriented environment
The basic concepts and terms of object-oriented programming are also provided
Basic principles of class and object organization are given
Object-oriented programming object class package attribute
Currently, the important directions and strategic objectives of the development of Kazakhstan's education are to improve the quality of education
Improving the quality of education depends on many factors
First, with the establishment of new education centres based on the full use of information and communication technologies to ensure higher education outcomes
It will ensure the effective organization of the educational process
Given the activities and research carried out in this area, it is difficult to say that the didactic capabilities of information and communication technologies are fully realized
This issue concerns the issues of professional training of specialists in the field of higher professional education in accordance with modern requirements
This was announced by Head of State N.
Nazarbayev's annual messages to the people of Kazakhstan pay special attention to the state-level normative documents adopted in the Republic of Kazakhstan and state programs related to the field of education
The Strategy "Kazakhstan 2050" in the tasks of higher professional education states: "Universities should not be limited only to educational services, they should develop applied and scientific research."
The document says about the need to develop an online education system through the creation of regional centers for improving training methods to improve vocational education
Head of State proposes to solve unresolved issues of domestic education system with introduction of innovative methods
This issue proposes to include the revision of the content of education and the curriculum in the system of higher vocational education in the curricula of disciplines providing it with practical skills and practical qualifications [1]
Professional training of future pedagogical specialists, including informatics specialists, is important in the implementation of this issue.
Therefore, the education of future generations with full knowledge of the facet and secret of information and communication technologies, capable of working with creativity with intellectual potential in accordance with the requirements of today, is entrusted to the teacher of informatics
Therefore, the new state policy in the field of education offers an effective solution to the issue of fundamental training of specialists in the field of informatics
This requires an improvement in the content of the training of informatics professionals
In this regard, in this article we study the specialties "Informatics - 5B011100"
subject "Object-oriented programming"
One of the main special disciplines for students in the specialty of informatics -
It is the subject of "Programming"
For this reason, the subject Olympiad of secondary school students takes place in this discipline, so knowledge of this discipline is of great importance for its better understanding.
On this subject, the task of developing the knowledge and skills of students and subject competencies is assigned to several special disciplines, the basics of programming begin with course 1 and continue until the defense of the diploma in 4 years (Object-oriented programming programming Programming Technology Programming Language Theory Programming and Broadcasting Methods Data Foundation and information systems Internet Programming System programming Logical programming
Currently, in the Republic of Kazakhstan, which trains future teachers of informatics, the subject of programming in accordance with the State Standard of Higher Professional Education is trained through the subjects of the component of choice in the department of training in special disciplines (12 credits)
This course covered the basics of programming, as well as the study of objectively oriented programming languages.
At the same time, programming training continued with the choice of "System Programming" and "Internet Programming Technology" to develop the skills and skills of future professionals.
Objective programming training was provided through the Object Pascal language in the Delphi Center or the C++ programming languages ​ ​ in the Builder environment
We offer to teach object-oriented programming based on the ActionScript 3 language in Adobe Flash
First we will stop at the place of general programming in the system of education and in the field of informatics
Programming is of particular importance in the training of future specialists as one of the main subject areas of informatics
The question of the fundamental training of future teachers from the field of programming is characterized by the integrity of the implementation of training, which includes, secondly, domestic political relations and interdisciplinary relations in the field of informatics, the disclosure of important foundations and connections of objects considered first
Programming training requires detailed and comprehensive study as a field of pedagogical specialty
The creation of a whole methodological system for teaching programming advocates the need to study all components of the methodological system
This issue provides for the creation of methods and types of teaching the goals and content of training, ensuring, in particular, the implementation of a person-oriented way of competence and differentiated education in terms of educational standards of the new generation
Since they are computer science students of professional interest in learning the programming language, it is important for them to understand the principle of building models that accurately reflect real processes and phenomena, and to turn a computer into a tool of real knowledge, providing the opportunity to obtain new knowledge about the investigated phenomena and processes
Nicklaus Wirth, who conducted in-depth programming research, noted the dynamic development of the programming field: "I achieved systematic training in his methodology, devoting an important part of my career to creating a program, and was amazed by his progressive development trends."
Provision of didactic capabilities of information and communication technologies in the process of training of informatics specialists in pedagogical universities
the most important is the choice of a programming system or environment that includes
As the results of research over several years and the experience of training in the subject of programming showed, future computer science teachers are offered the object-oriented programming language Action Script 3
Adobe Flash is the environment that connects graphics and programming, and the scripting language that works in this environment is the language of Action Script 3
Knowledge of Adobe Flash technology is essential for future computer scientists
Because at present, most of the electronic teaching aids used in the educational process are created in this environment
A specialist who is well versed in Adobe Flash technology will be able to use it effectively for his professional activities
Action Script 3 gives a familiar programmer a reliable programming model
Some basic functions of the Action Script 3 language are improved compared to its previous versions
Modern new compiler code provides more optimization than its previous version
The new advanced programming interface works with programs aimed at real objects, providing control of objects at a low level
Enhanced scripting capabilities in ActionScript 3 compared to previous versions
It is also much easier to create complex applications in ActionScript 3 language, containing extensive object-oriented information with several repetitive program codes
The program code in ActionScript 3 is ten times faster than previous versions
Object-oriented programming is a method of organizing code in the form of objects by grouping individual elements, including, in particular, information and functions
An object-oriented programming approach allows you to organize a program by grouping certain parts of information or frequently used functions and actions
These elements will be merged into a single element called an object
The main achievement of this programming method is the ability to associate these values ​ ​ and functions
Object-oriented programming can be conditionally divided into two
The first part contains strategies and approaches to creating a program (object-oriented design)
The second part of object-oriented programming is a program structure that allows programming in a given programming language using an object-oriented programming method
This can be mentioned in general operations of object-oriented programming:
Defining classes
creation of a method of access to set and geta methods;
Control class access to property methods
constructing static methods and properties;
Create enumerated structures
Use and define interfaces
Inheritance work that includes overriding class elements
Important is the provision of basic terms and key concepts considered in object-oriented programming training
These include instance type inheritance mechanisms that are considered an operator of the design data type point of the attribute class hierarchy.
An attribute is a property assigned to an element of another class of a particular class (for example, properties or methods)
used to determine whether a property or method can be used for code in another part of the program
For example, Private and Public
(open) - these attributes
A closed method can only be called in code within a class, and an open method is called by any code in the program
A class is a definition of the order in which lenses of a specific type execute (as a template or sample object for a given data type)
A class hierarchy is a related structure of many classes that determines which classes arise from functions of other classes
Constructor - A special method defined in this class is called when an instance of this class is created
Designers are typically used to define a value without warning or to perform other operations when you state an object
Data type is the type of storage of information about any variables
The term information type has the same meaning as a class
A dot operator is a dot character that displays derived elements of an object in ActionScript 3, such as other programming languages
For example, myObject
The point operator in the myProperty expression refers to the meaning of the term myProperty, which is an element of a named object myObject
Enumerated types are a collection of linked racks grouped for ease of use as properties of a single class
Heredity is one of the basic principles of object-oriented programming
A mechanism that shows that all functions of another class defined when defining one class are covered
An instance is a real object created in a program
A namespace is a user attribute that provides complete control over the ability to access another code.
Let's focus on the capabilities of the object-oriented programming language ActionScript 3
The main kernel of the language running in ActionScript 3 is ActionScript, and its application interface is Adobe Flash Player
The main ActionScript language is determined by the syntax of this language and the type of high-level information
The ActionScript 3 language is based on objects that are its main components
Each announced variable is the object of each constructed class of each prescribed function
A program written in the language ActionScript 3 can be considered as a group of objects interacting with each other, responsible for an event that performs certain actions
Programmers with programming directed at a Java or C++ object can perceive lenses as a module containing two types: data stored in corresponding variables or properties, as well as actions performed using methods
Objects in language ActionScript 3 are defined in the same way, but have minor features
Objects in language ActionScript 3 are also provided as a property set
These properties act as a container that stores not only data, but also functions or other objects
The method is called if the function is associated with objects in this way
The small difference between the classes Java or C ++ and classes in the ActionScript 3 language in the ActionScript 3 language is that classes are not just abstract values, and are a lens of classes for maintaining properties and methods of these classes.
Adding these instructions is a technique that enables high-level code of the executable program or package
Each class in language ActionScript 3 has a property called a prototype object
Compared to previous versions of the ActionScript language, the prototype plays a minor role in the hereditary system
The prototype lens enables you to share properties and instance values of all classes as static properties and methods
Objects and Classes
Each object in language ActionScript 3 is defined by a class
A class can be treated as a template or a project of an object type
A class definition can consist of variables and stabilizers that contain data values and methods that are a function, and a function consists of actions that cover a given class
Values stored in properties can be primitive values or values of other objects
Primitive values - these numbers are strings and Boolean values [3]
Language ActionScript 3 includes a number of established classes
It is the core of this language
Some of the installed classes describe the primitive values ​ ​ of the Namber String Boolean
And the array math and XML class defines sufficiently complex objects
All classes originate from the object class regardless of whether they are installed or defined by the user
The information object type is not a information type, even if all other classes are derived classes, without notification (notes)
You can define your own classes using an employee word called CLASS
The class property can be reported in three ways: constants are defined using the words of an employee with const variables, and the properties get and set are defined using the attributes get and set in the method message
Methods can be reported using the word punction
An instance of a class is created using a new statement, such as an instance of the Date class called myBirthday:
The concept of the ActionScript 3 language contains a term called a package
The package and namespace are interrelated formulations
Packages help reduce inconsistencies between names that simplify code sharing when defining classes
The namespace allows you to control the visibility of an identifier, for example, property names and methods allow you to use them in program code, regardless of whether it is inside or outside the package
Packages allow you to organize a class file, and the namespace controls the scope of personal properties and methods
Packages in language ActionScript 3 are made using a namespace, but these two concepts are not synonymous
When a package is reported, a special type is created that indicates the namespace, and it becomes known when compiled
The example below shows an example of creating a simple package from a single class and uses a directive called package
In this case, the class name is Samplecode
Because the class is inside the package, the compiler automatically determines the name of the class when compiling, creating the full name: samples
The compiler also defines any methods according to the names sampleGreeting and sampleFunction ():
changes
Another feature of the ActionScript 3 language in a high level package is accompanied not only by classes, but also by variable functions and instructions
One of the modern ways of using this feature is to define a namespace at a high level of the package, which is considered possible for all classes of this package
There are also two specifiers at the high level of the package: public and internal
You can import packages to create
These issues are the organization of facilities and classes in the language ActionScript 3

On educational and methodological support of special disciplines studied in the process of professional training of informatics teachers/Bulletin of KazUPU named after Abay

The article provides technologies and methods for creating an electronic tutorial
The need to create electronic tools, however, the importance of application in the training process is highlighted.
The composition of the creation of an electronic tool with a description of the features of the introduction and use of an electronic tutorial in higher education institutions has been determined
As a result, an electronic tool for teaching the subject "Programming Technology" was created.
This article describes how to use the e-tutorial in the learning process
Digital interactive multimedia educational resources multimedia training program e-textbook e-learning complex e-learning manual
Another main happiness of the modern stage of informatization of education is that the educational process includes single software and methodological complexes called electronic directories, encyclopedia training programs, electronic educational and methodological complexes of a new generation of various electronic manuals, such as computer textbooks and training manuals
The creation of computer educational and methodological complexes for secondary higher vocational and additional education systems is identified as one of the main areas of informatization of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan
The main issues of e-learning are the creation and effective use of the information educational environment based on information and communication technologies
The electronic textbook is effective in the following cases: it can provide feedback; saves time with repeated application of hypermatic explanations; Checks the knowledge of a specific part can specify and simulate with short text
The use of electronic textbooks in any field of education will allow students not only to increase cognitive activity, but also to work creatively to create a system of thinking
Rapid globalization intensifies global competition
The presidential program of informatization of education led to the creation of electronic textbooks
Today, 60% of the content of university education and 10% of vocational education are various digital interactive multimedia educational resources (SIMBR): electronic textbooks (EP); Multimedia Training Programme (SME); virtual travel (VS); electronic didactic tools (EDR) and
digitized by creating
An electronic textbook is a help not only for a student, but also for a teacher
This is a means of remote professional communication with authors of electronic textbooks
Because our electronic programs are often the notes of a finished lesson
Also, due to its comprehensiveness, they can become a methodological database [1]
An electronic textbook is needed for full-time work, especially in the remote educational part
Because he:
facilitates understanding of the material being studied through others;
preparation	per level	connected	student	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	guide adaptation with appropriate intellectual capabilities and ambitions;
output of reports and consideration of examples focused on the significance of the report, exempting from numerous transformations and calculations;
Creates extensive self-monitoring capabilities depending on all stages of work
An electronic textbook is necessary for obtaining a comprehensive education in the subject assigned to the student
Electronic textbook can be used in practical classes in special classrooms
Because he:
Frees up time from analyzing decisions obtained by computer output of many reports;
allows the teacher to conduct classes on a computer as an independent work;
Allows a teacher to communicate with a computer the level of complexity and content of the work of monitoring the level of knowledge of students [2]
The active use of information technologies in the education system, together with its function as a tool for solving specific pedagogical reports, leads to the creation of new forms of teaching and education methods that affect the development of didactics and methods
For example, the widespread use of Internet technologies contributes to the accelerated development of distance learning
The development of computer graphics and training systems of multimedia technologies prompted the creation of a training methodology by "penetrating" into a virtual situation reflecting activities in a professional environment
And the emergence of computer network training classes has become a big role in the form of business games and competitions
training contributed to the development of the technique [3]
Informatization of the education system requires the creation of new textbooks
These include Electronic Tutorials (EOC)
Often, an electronic textbook is a copy of a simple book equipped with a set of questions with answers
This view is not simple and does not cover the whole spectrum of the phenomenon under consideration.
This is due to the underestimation of the possibilities of computer tutorials on the potential impact on the cognitive sphere of students [4]
Another main happiness of the modern stage of informatization of education is that the educational process includes single software and methodological complexes called electronic directories, encyclopedia training programs, electronic educational and methodological complexes of a new generation of various electronic manuals, such as computer textbooks and training manuals
Currently, the computer educational and methodological complex is widely introduced into the Kazakh education system in the field of laboratory and practical classes at lecture classes [5]
Information technology is the quantitative accumulation of information using multimedia and telecommunication means to create qualitatively new products in such intellectual areas as information support and education, large-scale scientific technologies of search processing
New information technologies in the training process require computer-based training programmes and an information-sharing network
These components together form an information-equipped learning environment, which provides control over the student's independent work and his work with educational material
Different opinions on the application of information technologies are expressed during the training process
Someone does not recognize him, and someone else
These views are due to the limited subjective experience in this relatively new area
Objective assessment of the axial industry can be made only after qualification of a large amount of information on a given topic [3]
Multimedia training programs allow you to fully use all the capabilities of visual display of video text and sound
The visualization of educational material is especially important because the widespread use of the computer with the growing amount of information that modern students need to know helps to increase the efficiency of the educational process by visualizing it and diversity
Features of the introduction and application of EOC in educational institutions:
Improve the availability of educational facilities for students and teachers;
Improving the quality of education through the use of additional systems for the transmission and synthesis of information that qualitatively improve the educational process;
Improving the skills of teachers through the introduction of modern information technologies in the system of training and advanced training;
modelling of various processes and phenomena;
increase the competitiveness of the educational institution, competing with other educational organizations to improve the educational process;
Expansion of education activities using Internet-based distance learning;
Take an individual approach to each student (student);
Promptly monitor the pupil through qualification and feedback;
Ensure independent control of the student's educational and cognitive activities;
visual demonstration of educational information and
Allows [2]
The creation of a training system with the help of a tool program consists of 4 basics:
Edit Training Script
Here, the teacher-trainer must decide which part of the training course to include in the program
Generation of control fragments of drawing with text introduction of personal frames of new programs on computer
There should be small knowledge of the functions of a pedagogical computer, opportunities for implementation and editing
Establishing a link between the individual hellenes of the training program and the entire dialog system
Supervision of the program during operation, making repairs and additions to it
Creating a training program in the ways of the tool system will help overcome the main barriers
The first step towards the study of computer technologies is the consideration of monitoring programs [3]
Topical issues of educational policy - radical renewal of the scientific and methodological system of knowledge provision, improvement of the quality of professional training, change of forms and methods of education, elimination of advanced educational experience in it and divergence of needs of modern society, increase of its role in ensuring continuity in the process of improvement of innovative knowledge and ability to apply modern technology and technologies at a high level
Therefore, one of the important and complex issues of further training pedagogy is the creation of a new system of professional guidance for the development of professional qualifications in order to optimize the teacher of education for a future specialty.
To train such a specialist, it is necessary to intensify the educational process, improve new forms and methods of training
Activating the learning process -
organization and carrying out on a scientific basis of the educational process to attract them to the profession, the possibility of searching for creative thinking when considering ways of lasting education
In view of the above, an electrical training manual is created for students 5B011100-Informatics of specialties in the subject "Programming Technology"
The main sheet of the electronic tutorial consists of two buttons: content and authors
You can navigate to the following pages by clicking the appropriate buttons
Clicking the Contents button opens the tutorial sheet (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Content of the electronic tutorial
The electronic educational tool includes lectures on the following sections of the student's laboratory work, as well as a list of Glossary literature for controlling the student's knowledge
In accordance with each lecture, topics were discussed and described in detail
Laboratory work tasks are performed by pressing the corresponding button on the content page (Figure 2)
Figure 2
Independent work of the student
The student's independent work consists of 15 options
Each instruction gives multiple tasks
One student performs tasks in one version and transfers to the teacher
Tasks on the subject of programming technology are designed according to the principle
Therefore, students cope with the tasks with interest
Test tasks are shown in the following figure (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Test Query Sheet
Test sheet contains 20 closed questions with test jobs
Test jobs created for interim inspection
You can immediately find out how many points you scored after solving test tasks
The use of such electronic teaching aids in the field of education will allow students not only to increase cognitive activity, but also to work creatively to create a logical system of thinking
Recently, many scientific papers have been published in the scientific literature on the use and processing of electronic publications in the learning process
Also, many universities use them in the educational process and independently process their electronic publications for education
All this proves that the country has developed a theory and practice of applying and processing educational electronic publications in the educational process
In conclusion, modern electronic tutorials allow students to independently control their practical skills and skills by teaching experimental research with an individual pace of theory training in order to be convenient for themselves
Electronic tutorials can be used when organizing independent training when performing course and thesis work at laboratory-practical classes when reading lectures, as well as during current and final control

The main approach to the spread of harmful impurities in the atmosphere is provided
Identified the issues and objectives necessary for mathematical modeling of the process of transportation of pollutants of the boundary layer of the atmosphere
Important aspects of the calculation of the boundary layer of the atmosphere are reflected
Peculiarities of primary and limit conditions setting are defined
The models are aimed at solving various calculations arising in the assessment of the environmental load through the surface properties of the earth and pollution of the air basin
Mathematical model - pollutants of the boundary layer of the atmosphere
Atmospheric air plays a major role in anthropogenic effects on the environment and the human body
Determination of patterns of atmospheric impurities distribution and peculiarities of their spatiotemporal propagation is one of the most important objectives of the atmospheric air pollution process study
The study of this trend is important and poses some difficulties for the protection of the environment
Having determined the patterns and features of the spread of impurities in the atmosphere, we will determine the trend of pollution of the air basin, evaluate its objective state, and as the results of the study we receive practical preparation of possible actions to ensure air purity
One of the efficient and economical ways to study the spread of harmful impurities in the atmosphere is the use of the mathematical modeling method due to real production and semiconductor studies is expensive, and experiments are impossible
Unchanging and
you can achieve the desired result by correctly selecting digital algorithms and a mathematical model of a given process with the same properties
Selection of algorithms and programs of an effective model of harmful impurities distribution in the atmosphere
- A scientifically and practically interesting question
It will allow you to study the conditions for the formation of atmospheric rotation of local zones by changing the thermal and orographic characteristics of the Earth's surface
The mathematical models we have chosen are aimed at solving various calculations that arise when assessing the environmental load through the properties of the earth's surface and air basin pollution
Our digital algorithms meet all these requirements and have practically executable algorithms [1-2]
The spatial model of the local atmospheric process of transporting pollutants in the boundary layer of the atmosphere consists in the implementation of its following main blocks: non-stationary unstable three-dimensional hydrotermodynamics of the boundary layer of the atmosphere; wet exchange and heat exchange in soil; three-dimensional non-stationary model of mixture transportation and diffusion in boundary and ground atmosphere
One of the important aspects in solving the calculations of the boundary layer of the atmosphere is the establishment of initial and limit conditions for a system of hydrothermodynamics equations that are mathematically correct and do not physically contradict
The setting of primary and limit conditions largely depends on the specifics of each particular case
Therefore, let us consider some general observations on the results of measurements on models of the type provided at t = 0, and they relate to the input parameters
But in practice, it is difficult to obtain complete physical information about the initial mesoscale fields
Therefore, the initial field of deviations during quantitative calculations for this type of atmospheric circulation is considered zero
In this case, if the amount of time is small, the decision of the report characterizes the adaptation of meteorological fields to conditions, and turbulence is involved in this process.
It is necessary to carry out the process of restoring the value of weather elements in the corners of the system network, since information about the field of weather elements comes from the network of stations located outside the system area
To restore fields from the specified dimensions, Marchuk G
We use the algorithm described in works [3456]
As limit conditions, individual products equal to zero in coordinates are taken in accordance with deviations of relief values ​ ​ of weather elements at fixed points in horizontal direction
In order to ensure that these conditions do not conflict with the soil relief and temperature data, the soil relief and temperature functions must be such that in some sub-regions of the environmental boundary the unevenness of the relief and temperature of the gasket surface is eliminated.
Deviation of meteorological elements at high altitude allowed by the vertical coordinate of the limit conditions is switched off or limited by the lower inversion boundary, which means that the upper side of the movement is limited by a fixed plane
Sometimes, on some unconfirmed page, vertical velocity is a function of an unfixed border
The horizontal velocity components on the relief surface are zero, and the vertical components are equal to the full product of the relief function in time
Temperature and humidity are taken as a certain function
In this case, the function defining the upper boundary of the atmosphere is one of the primary characteristics
Therefore, when using such a model, it is necessary to transform the hydrothermodynamics equation system, which, when solving the report together with other weather elements, determines the upper boundary function and takes into account the relief structure of the gasket surface.
Currently, several methods are known for determining the height of the boundary layer of the atmosphere depending on the parameters of the relief value and ground turbulent characteristics, based on the Dirdorf formula, indicating the value and amount of movement of the surface heat flow
The basis of the physical characteristics of the surface layer of the atmosphere is the theory of similarity for the turbulent regime in the stratification medium, indicated in the work of Monin Obukhov [7]
According to this theory, for the surface layer of the atmosphere, all static characteristics normalized at the scale of long speed temperatures are a universal function of dimensionless height, which is taken as a parameter of hydrostatic stability
In this case, the vertical compilers of the mean fields of weather elements through some functions depend on the non-dimensional height argument
Knowing the specific type of these functions, turbulent flows of heat of moisture and motion can be determined
Having studied the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory [7] and Businger empirical functions, we create a system of surface layer equations, where the friction rate is a potential temperature and the scale of specific humidity, the height of the surface layer.
The formulas for the height of the aboveground layer are then used as limit conditions for calculating local atmospheric processes in the area above the surface layer, while performing coordinates and a function of time with determined surface temperature and humidity.
For predictive calculations, this condition does not meet, so for specific conditions, together with other weather elements, the temperature and humidity of the gasket surface is determined, as well as closing equations of temperature and humidity of the gasket surface are included in the system of equations
Consider general models that take into account the interaction of the dynamics of the boundary layer of the atmosphere with the surfaces of the thermal and orographic homogeneous gasket
For land, these are models of the temperature regime of the soil and wet exchange, taking into account the equation of thermal equilibrium at the border with the atmosphere
The distribution of temperature in the soil is characterized by a certain equation
As ground conditions, we obtain the heat equilibrium equation
As is known, the temperature of the surface air and the total evaporation of the humidified surface depend on the insolation of the surface action.
The variety of solar insulation of slopes associated with their exposure, in accordance with orographically uneven vertical conditions of the surface of the gasket, can lead to mesometeorological contradictions
Therefore, to calculate the flow of solar radiation on the slopes of the Earth M
We apply a non-dimensional formula in the work of Budyko [8]
To detect soil temperature, many models of atmospheric dynamics use the thermal equilibrium equation
The thermal physical characteristics of soils differ, as a result of which temperatures over different types of soils differ over small distances and affect the atmosphere in the lower layers
Thermal and wet modes in the soil-air system affect the development of the plant and, accordingly, the environment
Changing soil moisture also changes the equilibrium of radiation on the surface
As moisture increases, the albedo decreases
Solution of hydrodynamics equations system with constant coefficient of turbulent exchange and turbulent viscosity even of boundary layer thickness
indicates that it is consistent with some specific physical properties, although it has a specified external parameter
The disadvantage of the solution of the report is that the wind displacement is proportional to the displacement of the geometric wind, no matter how large the turbulent exchange coefficient
We use a method based on solving the equilibrium equation of turbulent energy to close the system of equations of the boundary layer of the atmosphere to vertical diffusion coefficients, the operators of horizontal turbulent exchange are calculated through a tensor of viscous voltages
Various methods are used to describe horizontal and vertical turbulent exchange, since the equilibrium equation of turbulent energy takes into account the temperature stratification of the atmosphere, which is very important for vertical exchange
In nature, high relative humidity forms a cloud, so in some individual areas located in the upper atmosphere, stratification of the atmosphere changes due to the occurrence of additional heat flow due to evaporation
It was found that they form clouds with horizontal dimensions of 5-10 km and vertical dimensions of about 15-25 km when observing mesourdists, whose horizontal dimensions reach several tens of kilometers
In this regard, phase shifts of moisture should be taken into account
In this case, the system of equations of the boundary layer of the atmosphere with initial and limit conditions is solved taking into account the term of formation of the liquid phase and is supplemented by the equations of transfer and diffusion for own irrigation
For quantitative modeling of hydrometeorological regime of production areas in primary transmissions in retinal nodes there should be a value of weather elements
Measurements are carried out at weather stations located unevenly in the area
Therefore, on the basis of network zones, the question arises of restoring the size of weather elements at the station
Restoration of field construction of hydrometeorological elements V
Performed in accordance with Penenko's work [69]
Thus, we identified the issues and objectives necessary for mathematical modeling of the process of transporting pollutants in the boundary layer of the atmosphere

The article defines classes of mathematical models, on which the model of transportation of harmful impurities of the surface layer of atmospheric air is based and stages of use are defined
The principle of the results of experimental studies with the analysis of numbers in which the main requirements for mathematical models are revealed is that mathematical models have a difference in environmental units and the consequences of the methods of describing them.
Mathematical model of harmful impurities for the spread of harmful impurities in the atmospheric layer
Scientific and practical interest in studying the patterns of air pollution of the surface layer of the atmosphere and the features of their spatial and temporal distribution is constantly increasing
They provide the basis for an objective assessment of the trend and state of air pollution, as well as for the planning of possible clean air actions.
In many production areas and cities, due to a sharp increase in the environmental situation, research is developing related to modelling the trend of air pollution in the surface atmosphere [1]
Environmental Impact of Natural and Man-Made Disasters
Thus, as a result of the work of industrial industries and motor vehicles, gaseous and liquefied products are produced into the environment, for example, carbon monoxide nitrogen and sulfuric aldehydes benzapyrene
zinc and t
In addition, the photochemical reaction on the surface layer will create ozone and other toxicants that are dangerous to human and plant and animal health.
A small amount of pollutants under certain meteorological conditions creates adverse environmental conditions in settlements
Natural and man-made disasters are even more dangerous, resulting in large-scale pollution
Due to the high cost of practical research of the above phenomena, sometimes even the inability to conduct complete physical modeling causes interest in the method of theoretical research - mathematical modeling
In this case, the object of the study is not the phenomenon itself, but its mathematical model, which according to the example can be obtained in the form of a system of differential equations in a separate product with initial and limit conditions [2]
Mathematical models are classified into two classes: deterministic and stochastic (probabilistic)
Only models of the first type are considered in this work.
Mathematical modeling using a deterministic approach consists of the following stages [1-3]:
Physical analysis of the investigated phenomenon and analysis of the physical model of the object

determination of structural parameters and output of system of basic equations with corresponding primary and limit conditions

Obtaining a quantitative solution of a system of differential equations
Comparison of obtained results with known practical data and their physical interpretation
Parametric study of the investigated object
The main requirement for the mathematical model is the correspondence of the obtained results of quantitative analysis with the data of experimental studies
In order to perform this contract, it is necessary to:
in the mathematical model, the laws of conservation of energy and mass momentum must be fulfilled;
mathematical model should correctly reflect the basis of the investigated phenomenon
No phenomenon can be fully described using a mathematical model, so you should specify the limits of the application of the model, that is, the assumptions used to obtain a system of basic equations on the corresponding initial and limit conditions
to define
The comprehensiveness of mathematical models is a consequence of the methods of reflecting and describing the unity of the environment
Therefore, the methods and results obtained and collected from mathematical modeling of a certain phenomenon can be replaced by a wider class of other trends [4 5]
For example, when considering differential equations characterizing heat exchange and hydrodynamics, dependent variables characterizing a given trend obey the general conservation law
If the constraint variable is denoted as F, then the generalized type of differential equation is as follows:
where G is the rotation coefficient (diffusion of thermal conductivity and t
- member of power supply
The specific type of values G and S depends on the nature of the variable F
The generalized differential equation includes four terms: a non-stationary convective diffusion and a power supply term
The dependent variable F is a different magnitude, for example, the kinetic turbelence energy constituting the mass concentration of the temperature components, and t
The rotation factor G and the power supply member have a value corresponding to C
Density p mass concentration can be associated with variables such as the pressure temperature equation
These variables and velocity components must satisfy the law of mass conservation or the continuity equation, the form of which is:
Equations (1) and (2) can be written tensor:
You can create a generalized digital method using a generalized equation and prepare a multi-purpose computing program
In general, it is necessary to solve non-stationary or spatial calculations, which require more force in the preparation of a computer program
Reporting uses reasonable assumptions that do not greatly affect the calculation result when solving tasks
Using a mathematical model created in this way (in an aqueous medium in the surface layer of the atmosphere, etc.
) under the influence of various external conditions (air temperature, wind speed, temperature stratification in the atmosphere and t
) you can investigate the dynamics of pollution spread and the parameters of the source of pollution
By analyzing the level of pollution by different components at different points of time, comparing the results with the established maximum possible concentrations, it is possible to propose ways to reduce the concentration of pollution of the air basin
A layer of atmospheric air above a surface with a thickness of 10 to 100 m is called a surface layer
In this layer maximum stability in height of gradients of all meteorological elements and turbulent flows
Although the processes on this floor are closely related to all marginal trends, when solving experimentally significant calculations, it is necessary to establish internal connections between meteorological elements and turbulent characteristics of one ground layer [5]
The rotation process is simulated taking into account the mixed limit of mathematical physics and consists of an equation of revolution that takes into account turbulent diffusion
Limit conditions at report setting provide for contact conditions within the boundaries of the distribution of layers specified by z = 0 on the minimum layer and z = h3 on the maximum layer
Prediction theory for turbulent mode in stratified medium is adopted for physical description of surface layer of atmosphere [6 7]
According to this theory

Direct gradients of average fields of meteorological elements depend on an argument without measurement of  some functions decide on the help of  s () of  q ()
Thus, the specific type of these functions allows the determination of turbulent flows of thermal moisture and motion
Let us write the Monin-Obukhov theory and the system of surface layer equations using Businger's empirical function:

this is not possible for calculations, therefore, to close the system of equations, it is necessary to create a model in which the temperature and humidity of the gasket surface are determined together with weather elements
The method currently used to solve this report is to construct a model of the dynamics of the boundary layer of the atmosphere during the interaction of the thermal and orographic non-uniform gasket surface
This model of soil temperature regime for a dry place is the equation of thermal balance at the border with the atmosphere and the model of wet exchange
We believe that for the surface of the water simplicity are given functions  0 q0:
 0  f 0 (t) 	q  0622  E0 ( 0 ) / p 	(10) where: elasticity of water vapor saturation at temperature E0 -  0; p - atmospheric pressure; f 0 (t) - water surface temperature

At a windless temperature fall of temperature between levels z = 0 and z  z can reach big sizes Therefore at the solution of the equation (12) the semi-empirical parametrical formula is applied to a viscous layer:
Equation (12) is the limit of the equation for z = 0 (11)
The condition of the second limit for (11) is given at the depth of the NP, where a daily fluctuation in the temperature in the soil is not allowed, i.e.:

The temperature of the surface layer of air and the total evaporation of the humidified surface depend on the insolation of the surface

The article will consider the course of mathematical analysis of future teachers of mathematics to increase the inability to vocational training
Main characteristics of vocational and pedagogical training of future teachers of mathematics are determined
The university will present the forms of career guidance organization of the course of mathematical analysis of future teachers of mathematics
For future teachers, the directions of choice disciplines will be given in the form of special courses or special seminars to improve the vocational and pedagogical orientation
Master Class of Vocational Orientation of Mathematical Analysis Course Lecture Practical Lesson Pedagogical Practice
Currently, it is important at the university to solve the problem of training future teachers with a new pedagogical orientation through special disciplines
Increasing the training of future mathematics teachers is especially relevant; the role of mathematical knowledge is currently growing
is one of the issues
Because the urgency of this problem is caused by the following circumstances: firstly, the leading place of mathematics in the fundamental and applied sciences; secondly, the peculiarity of mathematics as a discipline; thirdly, the place of mathematics as a subject of study among other subjects undergoing school; fourthly, there is a significant shortfall in the training of mathematics teachers
In this regard, future mathematicians should receive comprehensive and professional education within the walls of higher education
The training of future specialists as fully developed persons who have gained vocational education is carried out in various areas: the provision of scientific and methodological means for improving the content of the curricula, upgrading the qualifications of vocational-oriented teacher-teachers and others.
Upgrading the status of the teacher as a whole will allow introducing new innovations into the system of increasing their vocational and pedagogical orientation in accordance with modern requirements
Akhmet Baitursynov "School Teacher"
The school will be what the teacher will be
A teacher who knows how to teach the necessary knowledge and pedagogy at school "[1]
Mordkovich, based on the psychological and pedagogical concepts of pedagogical and educational activities of methodological education and the development of training on the dialectical integrity of theory and practice, created the concept of vocational and pedagogical training of future mathematics teachers
The concept of training in vocational and pedagogical orientation determines the need for students to form certain purposeful foundations of professional excellence, which can provide its scientific basis and teaching methods that require deep knowledge of school mathematics, which arises with an interest in mathematics as a subject of educational science [1]
Special attention should be paid to the works of doctors of methodological sciences who have made specific proposals and materials in the teaching of school mathematics to a future teacher who has made a significant contribution to the development of science and methods of teaching mathematics by writing scientific and methodological works in Kazakh

Issues related to the training of future teachers in vocational and pedagogical orientation were given special attention to the research of teachers and psychologists
Ability to organize psychological and pedagogical vigilance and observation, passion for pedagogical work, love and interest in students in vocational and pedagogical orientation
refers to pedagogical decency as multifaceted and perseverance as purposeful
Studying the psychological aspects of professional training problems, Kandybovich came to the conclusion: "The formation of professional orientation for students is that their interest in the professions of the future, the tendency and ability to raise their knowledge to a higher level even in the period after graduation, constantly engaged in professional works that have chosen to satisfy their basic material spiritual needs, develop status and faith in their profession from the point of view of the future specialist" [3]
Didactic specialists understand the use of the content of read disciplines as training for vocational and pedagogical orientation in order to naturally link teaching methods and organizational forms with professional materials most necessary for determining the quality of the personality of future teachers
One of the main conditions of higher pedagogical education is vocational and pedagogical training of special disciplines
The issue of raising special disciplines to the highest level of vocational and pedagogical training will ensure the professionalism of students
Equips students with modern scientific knowledge
Vocational and pedagogical orientation is aimed at training teacher-mentors, not just teachers
A very important role in improving the professional training of mathematics teachers is the identification of the relationships between school mathematical disciplines and mathematical courses studied at the university for the training of future teachers, and their implementation
Mathematical courses studied at the university for the training of future teachers develop mathematical thinking, determined at the level of professional competencies, and introduce the school to the methodology of teaching mathematics
One of the conditions necessary for the professional training of future teachers at the university is the continuous development of pedagogical actions in the process of teaching students
Topics providing mathematics courses at the university for the training of future teachers play an important role in the implementation of vocational and pedagogical orientation
One of the main characteristics reflecting the vocational training of future mathematics teachers is their very high knowledge of future educational disciplines
Also, one of the main conditions for training in vocational and pedagogical orientation is the definition of the concepts of school mathematics in mathematical courses of a higher educational institution for the training of future teachers
To educate a math teacher with a qualified specialist in his/her field at a university for the training of future teachers, it is necessary to fulfill the requirements for subordinating the entire process of teaching to the idea of ​ ​ vocational and pedagogical orientation
For this purpose, the materials to be read should be aimed at forming the main characteristics of the vocational and pedagogical training of the future teacher of mathematics from a mathematical or methodological point of view [2]
The concept of vocational and pedagogical training puts on the advanced ideas connecting specific mathematical courses and methodological disciplines in a higher pedagogical institution
The main characteristics of the vocational and pedagogical training of future mathematics teachers:
very high level of knowledge of materials;
comprehensive training and presentation of materials;
Understanding the substance of the materials to be read
the ability to motivate educational activities;
modeling in training;
ability to create and apply algorithms;
understanding the severity levels of logical considerations;
familiarization with school textbooks;
cognitive activity and creative thinking
Mathematical analysis course is one of the special disciplines that play a leading role in the higher educational institution for the training of future teachers [1]
In the training of future mathematicians at a higher pedagogical institution, the study of the subject of mathematical analysis takes a large place
The special role of ideas and concepts of mathematical analysis methods for the training of mathematics teachers
Because, firstly, mathematical analysis initiatives are studied at school; secondly, mathematical analysis is an extensive section of mathematical science, starting with deep antiquities
Knowledge of the basics of mathematical analysis of its theoretical and practical importance is necessary not only for future teachers, but also for a specialist with higher education
The content of courses on choosing a vocational and pedagogical orientation should be in the subject of mathematical analysis
The formation of mathematical concepts, which are general issues of teaching mathematics in these courses, includes methods of active learning and the structure of conducting lessons, teaching to prove theorems and issuing reports (Revival of the past required to master new educational material, selection of the most effective ways and methods of presenting new educational material, correct selection of a package of exercises and reports necessary for careful assimilation of newly passed material to teach students mathematically to speak correctly
) may be associated with mastering improvement pathways
Also, exact numbers must be studied by a deeper study of the main directions of the Fourier series of integral calculations of functions with many sequences.
Ability to form methodological approaches to students through a course of mathematical analysis of teachers at a university for the training of future teachers; teaching students the ability to make mathematical calculations; identification of the interest of students in mathematical analysis and as a science and educational discipline and questions of their motivation for the teacher's profession through the materials of this course; Identification of the skills and skills that students should possess in the mathematical analysis course in the mathematical and analytical initiatives discipline; improvement of professional and special knowledge of students through materials of mathematical analysis course; development of requirements defining issues of vocational-oriented training of the course of mathematical analysis; The basis for improving the vocational and pedagogical orientation is the formation of the foundations of professional excellence through the training of mathematical analysis courses for future teachers [1]
The issues of improving the school mathematical subject and the course of mathematical analysis at the university in accordance with the new requirements of its current somewhat ideological
systems and methods of their training.
The course of mathematical analysis should carry out interdisciplinary connections and internal connections between some topics and school mathematics
Therefore, the relevant issue is the implementation of the vocational and pedagogical orientation of training in the course of mathematical analysis at the university for the training of future teachers
Forms of professional orientation of the organization of the process of teaching a course of mathematical analysis of future mathematics teachers at a university: lectures, consultations, practical classes, independent work of specialists in control work, courses of pedagogical practices of course and graduate works, etc.
One form of training for future mathematics teachers
Lectures occupy a special place
During the lecture, students will hear new educational material
Very complex didactic phenomenon from a lecture-methodical point of view
The ideological orientation of the purpose of the lecture is that the knowledge in which its accuracy is given is understandable to students, requires great skill on the part of the teacher
The teacher in preparation for the lecture draws attention to the ways and structure of interpreting new concepts to its content
The content of the lecture is determined by the teacher depending on the curriculum and textbooks
The content of the lecture is a guarantee of increasing the efficiency of teaching and craftsmanship
Specific form-practical exercises that carry out the connection of theory and practice in professional orientation
Improves skills and knowledge using lessons learned from hands-on activities
When conducting practical classes, the teacher, guided by the program and curriculum of the subject, should provide the ability to conduct classes, successfully teach individual classes of students
The difference between practical classes and lectures is characterized by student activity and the achievement of pedagogical goals under the guidance of a teacher
Therefore, the active process of becoming a specialist arises when compiling a report in a practical lesson on the course of mathematical analysis
In the practical lesson of the course of mathematical analysis, examples and reports are considered that help to assimilate the theoretical materials presented at the lecture
Form-control work of vocational training of students
Several control work options are given
Control work involves the realization of many goals
Form of vocational training of students - independent work of students
The concept of independent work is understood as the independent performance by students of certain work without outside help
Independent work is characterized by the type of cognitive activity of students engaged in the audit class and outside it in a separate group [3]
Form of vocational training of students - special courses
We believe that the component of choice for future teachers should be presented as a special course or a special seminar after identifying certain abilities of students in 3-4 courses
The directions of the disciplines of choice in the form of special courses or special seminars to improve the vocational and pedagogical orientation for future teachers may be as follows [2]:
for students who have developed abilities for a certain field of theoretical mathematics (mathematical analysis of differential equations t
methodological direction - aimed at the in-depth development of independent or special questions of teaching a course of mathematical analysis;
pedagogic and psychological direction [2]
At the same time, one of the important methods of improving the learning process in the implementation of vocational training in mathematics is the implementation of interdisciplinary communication
Cases of problems in the training of mathematics teachers:
Place of math in other sciences
Place of obtaining mathematics in other educational disciplines at school
The ratio of mathematics in a university for the training of schools and future teachers
Form of vocational training of students - teaching practice
Pedagogical practice is carried out at pre-ordered and graduate courses
Pedagogical practice is the most important stage in the trajectory of professional formation of the future teacher
Forms of professional training of students - coursework and graduation
Thanks to the performance of course work, cognitive activity and demand of students develops, scientific skills begin to form
Coursework takes place in the training of future mathematics teachers
Graduate work is important in shaping future teachers
A special place is occupied by the mathematical training of students and their graduation work connecting the profession of the future teacher
Thus, we believe that the course of mathematical analysis at the university, which future teachers prepare, should be carried out in accordance with the concepts of vocational training

The article provides that in case of no risk, deterministic cases are extremely rare in the economic environment
Many events cannot be fully predicted, and this in itself poses a danger
In economics and business, in some cases, it is necessary to make decisions based on the construction of a hypothesis system taking into account the chosen goal
This is legal due to the lack of sufficient complete information in personal conditions to overcome uncertainty
And this translates from uncertainty to a risk-risk situation, which in an independent situation can be deviated from the goal, which can be caused by an unreasonable hypothesis, to the risk of incomplete obtaining the expected result.
providing alternative options to test the validity of the hypothesis to calculate the degree of risk and if this is of course possible to circumvent at least some of the possible damage;
it is necessary
Game theory avoids negative consequences from risk
Game Theory - Risk Win Function
Decision-making in the event of a threat and uncertainty of an economic threat, as well as the relationship between decision-making and risk-based game theory related to the application of game theory in risk management
and t
published several scientific papers
Threats arising from and on the basis of uncertain conflict are based on different concepts
The most notable of them is the well-studied concept of game theory and statistical solution, widely used in theory and practice [123]
Game theory is uncertainty in a conflict situation, that is, the interest of interested parties (players) or the opposite
one section of modern mathematics, which reads the mathematical model of decision-making in conditions where the parties (in an antagonistic game) or do not contradict (in the case of a game with opposite sides)
The founders of game theory are American scientists John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern
With the help of mathematics, they described the competitive phenomenon in relation to the market economy as a game [4]
The game is a formal description in a conflict situation with rules that accurately determine the actions of participants seeking to achieve a certain victory on the go by choosing a specific strategy (model)
The decision subject is called the player, and the goal function is called the winning function
Several players can participate in the game and some of them can participate in regular or temporary coalitions among themselves
A game in an organized coalition is called a coalition game
A two-player game is called a double game
Each player makes a decision so that he purposefully or flawlessly loses, that is, chooses a running strategy
Here, the player does not know what strategies another player adheres to
Thus, each player makes their own decision in case of uncertainty, and their chosen strategy depends on the course of all players in the game [5 6]
The game scheme is used in an economic environment in an uncertain conflict and threats arising from them
This scheme consists of the following components:
the first player is a control subject who selects a strategy on the go, justified in a set of 𝑆 decisions (pure strategies) = (𝑠1 𝑠2... 𝑠𝑚), one of which must be taken;
the second player - he can be in one of the double-costed incompatible conditions that make up the aggregate of the economic environment = (...), and one of them is necessarily fulfilled;
economic environment (which decision the second player makes)
lack of a priori information of the decision-maker that he is in a state;
𝐹 decision subject = (𝑓𝑘𝑗 𝑘 = 1... 𝑚; 𝑗 = 1...) exact value (matrix) of estimated functionality
the element is a quantitative assessment of the effective decision of the activity of the management subject in the case of their choice of strategy = (= 1...; = 1...
The proposed scheme of the simulation process of rational decision making may contain the following interpretation: the second player of the pair can be replaced by a random choice or an economical decision environment, and the decision conditions are characterized by a 𝐹 estimation function called a game matrix (statistical) or a win matrix.
The formal condition of decision-making is characterized threefold (𝑆 Θ 𝐹) by set according to the game-theoretic concept
From a practical point of view, the mixed game model becomes interesting
In the mixed game model, the set of strategies of the subject 𝑆 control is discrete and can take a rational number of options, and the set of conditions [theta] of the economic environment is continuous
Conditions of decision in this case
characterized by a set of functions [5-6]
Characterize creative and formal components related to the creation of a theoretical game model
The main stages of creative components:
forming a set of decisions of the first and second players, that is, a list of pure strategies of the decision subject and the state of the economic environment (nature);
Identification and formation of key performance and utility indicators in the development of a winning matrix;
determination of the existing information situation characterizing the course of the economic environment (identification);
selecting a decision criterion from a set of criteria specific to the identified information situation;
Decision on the combination of clean and mixed strategies according to the selected criterion if it is not possible to use clean and mixed strategies
Uncertainty requires the full development of the formal component, together with the creative component in the decision-making process in the event of conflict and the resulting threat
the use of a mathematical apparatus created on the basis of evaluation functionality and performance calculations, as well as the calculation of a set of effective (rational) strategies or effective (rational) strategies according to the chosen effective criterion are the value of the formal component
The first two stages of the creative component of the decision-making process form the basis of the game model
In the field of production, numerous examples of successful use of game models at the macroeconomic level are known
One of these examples allows you to choose the volume necessary for the sale of products, the so-called "new" and "old" goods [7]
For example, computer brands, such as "new" and "old" goods, during the years of publication of textbooks in libraries of educational institutions in accordance with the fashion for clothes
can be considered
Therefore, we are generally "new" and
"old" items
So that we are aware of the requests for 𝑒1 𝑒2 𝑒3 three "old" goods
After a certain time, the retail network will receive three "new" goods 𝑗1 𝑗2 𝑗3, which will be able to exchange the "old" goods
That is, "new" goods will reduce the demand for "old" goods
According to previous demand studies, the probability of selling "old" goods when "new" goods enter the trading network is known
The winning matrix for "new" and "old" items is shown in the following table (Table 1)
Game "new" and "old" items
Consider the conflict situation from the point of view of the first player (participant in the "old" goods)
We define this player as a 𝐴 player for the convenience of ourselves
player chooses his best strategy (), that is, the player (participant of "new" goods) meets the strategy (= 1 2 3) so that the player's strategy win is minimal
To find this strategy 𝐵𝑗, you must find the smallest of the number 𝐴𝑖 in the row according to the strategy 𝑎𝑖𝑗 in the winning matrix
Denote through 𝛼𝑖
Then
- Effective strategy indicator
Thus 𝐴 the analysis for the player can be carried out for the 𝐵 player
We get 𝐵𝑗 ineffective strategy indicator 𝛽𝑗
Fill in the corresponding performance indicators and values in Table 2:
Game performance indicators "new" and "old" products
Low Game Cost or Maximum Win (Assignment Principle)
high cost or minimum win (minimax principle)
Here
since high cost and low cost of the game are mutually exclusive and maximum strategies, as well as effective strategies of players.
It will be created with 𝑒2 and 𝑗2 minimal strategies
Game Solution 𝑣 = 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 07
Such a strategy is sustainable so that abandoning these strategies is not effective for both players
Thus, the example considered, which allows you to choose the volume necessary for the sale of "new" goods, such as the volume necessary for the sale of "old" goods, will give the maximum economic effect
Conclusion
Based on the concept of game theory, it will be possible to make effective decisions in conditions of uncertainty
It takes into account the interest of various stakeholders
All decision-makers considering any economic situation as a game
interest is taken into account
The above example of an economic game

Introduction
For each () point of the plane relative to the Cartesian coordinate system, the number of complexes = + is determined uniquely
If we consider the system of oblique angular coordinates in the plane (Figure 1), the question arises as to what complex number can be put on the point 𝑀 (𝑥 𝑦) relative to this system
In other words, if the coordinates of the point () in the Cartesian coordinate system are determined through the equations = cos = sin, then in the system of oblique angular coordinates, the question arises about how the coordinates of this point are determined
Coordinate conversion can be seen in this article when these and other questions move from one affine coordinate system to another
General complex plane of numbers
Provide affine coordinate system in plane 𝑅 (0 𝑒→1 𝑒→2)
Then each 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦 (𝑥 𝑦 - specific digits; 𝑝2 =
+) with coordinates (;) in the plane to the total number of complexes
you can uniquely fit a point (Figure 1)
That is, the same correspondence is established between the set of points of the affine plane and the general complex set of numbers
If 𝑦 = 0, the number 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑝 ∙ 0 is actually
Specific numbers are displayed through the points of the axis 𝑂𝑥, so they are called the real axis
Figure 1-
On the contrary, with 𝑥 = 0, the number 𝑧 = 0 + 𝑝𝑦 gives an assumed number relative to the parameter 𝑝
The estimated numbers are displayed through the axis points 𝑂𝑦
Assumed axis of parameter "𝑝"
Approve at point 𝑂 the initial points of the affine and Cartesian coordinate system for listening to the geometric interpretation of common complex numbers (Figure 2)
1 and through 𝑖 denote the basis vector of the Cartesian system, and through 𝑝 1 and √𝜃0 = 𝜃0 > 0 the basis vectors of the affine system [1]
Consider the transformation: = = + in Cartesian coordinate system
Then 𝑀 (𝑥 𝑦)
goes to point 𝑀 𝑥 (𝜃1 + 𝑦); √−𝐷𝑦}
But 𝑅 this point (𝑂 𝑒→ 𝑒→)
has coordinates (𝑥; 𝑦) in the affine coordinate system
Affine coordinate system
define by parameters
Then 𝐷 = 1 − 𝜃 = − 1 < 0 √−𝐷 = 1
But (2; 1) 𝑅 points (𝑂 𝑒→1 𝑒→2) in the affine coordinate system
has coordinates (1; 1) (Figure 2)
Figure 2
The estimated axis direction is determined by the vector direction 𝑒→2 and is actual
with positive axis direction 𝜑 = arc 2√−𝐷
𝜑, typical for example = 1 means angle 𝜑 = 𝜋
creates an angle
Considered
In an affine coordinate system through vector equality ⃗𝑂⃗⃗⃗𝑀⃗⃗→ = 𝑥𝑒→1 + 𝑦𝑒→2
Defines the radius vector of the current point ()
Then the distance from the pole to the current point () is called the module of the total complex number = + and is indicated by the symbol
Means
In the example provided above, |⃗𝑂⃗⃗⃗𝑀⃗⃗⃗⃗→′| = 5, as
and () = = 2
Now the algebraically given 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦 summary of the complex number 𝑧̅ =
Define equality + [1]
Then = = + +
In this case, the parameters are expressed through and basis vectors of the affine system () = () =
in affine coordinate system () = +
𝑧̅ = 𝑥 + 𝜃1𝑦 -Open the geometric value of the node 𝑝𝑦
To do this in the plane
Let's determine which point is placed in the plane to point () in accordance with the number of complexes = + in its summary
First, consider affine symmetry regarding which structure, and look for answers to questions about how to define its equation.
Wanted centric
symmetry formation 𝑥 specific axis = 𝑥0
+ 𝜃1 passes through point 𝑦 and its guide
vector 𝑒→ 2 = vector 𝑂⃗⃗⃗⃗𝑃⃗→
Therefore, the equation of the structure of centric symmetry 𝑦 =
) defined by equality
Considered	sitting	in the example	that is,	𝜃0 = 𝜃1 = 2;	√−𝐷 = 1;	tan 𝜑 = 1
at presence of 𝑀 (1; 1) coordinates of point 𝑀∗ node to point (3; − 1)
𝜃0 defining affine coordinate system = 5 and 𝜃1 = 4
set parameters
𝑀0 provided in this system (2; 1) node to point 𝑀∗
find the coordinates of the point
Outcome
First, according to the parameters 𝜃0 = 5 𝜃1 = 4 𝐷 = 1 − 𝜃0 = − 1
√−𝐷 = 1	𝑝 = 𝜃1  + 𝑖√−𝐷 = 2 + 𝑖	tan 𝜑 = 2√−𝐷  = 1	and	|𝑒→  | = |𝑝| = √𝜃   = 5
define parameters
In the next queue, we find a line equation that will be centrically symmetric with respect to the affine system of points and ():	𝑦 =
) 𝑦 = 1 (𝑥 − 4)
Therefore, the formation of symmetry 𝑥 the actual axis = 4
intersection at point
At the same time, the point 𝑀∗ (6; − 1) is 𝑀0 and centric points 𝑀∗
will be a symmetry point
You can check the result using the formula 𝑀∗ (𝑥 + 𝜃1𝑦; −𝑦) to find the coordinates of the endpoint
Note
When displaying a report, you most often have to switch from the affine system to the Cartesian coordinate system
Therefore, consider the formulas for moving from an affine system to a Cartesian one and vice versa.
by definition of affine transformation	= 𝑧	where 𝑧	= 𝑥′ +
That is, (;) Cartesian coordinates of the point in question, a (;) affine coordinates of the same point
Let's print the equation from above:
Then 𝑀0 (2; 1) has Cartesian coordinates of the point (4; 1)
A 𝑀∗ (6; 1) for
has Cartesian coordinates (4; -1)
Inverse conversion, that is, the transition from Cartesian to affine

Converting an Affine Coordinate System
To provide in the plane two 𝑅 (𝑂 𝑒→ 1) and 𝑒→ 2 (𝑅 𝑂 𝑒→ 1) affine coordinates 𝑒→ 2
System Transition) to System (Figure 3)
To do this, () classify base vectors and vectors
where () coordinates of the point in the system ()
Then
from the vector equation we obtain the following affine transformation formulas:
here |𝛼11	𝛼12| ≠ 0
So we are a point (;)

Geometric value of multiplication of complex numbers in affine system
Reciprocal summary = + and = + where = + =
Note
If 𝐷 < 0, then the total number of complexes 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦 is also called an elliptical number
Then for elliptic points in the affine plane, the Euler formula is written as follows [123]:
here	𝐼(𝜃  𝜃  𝜓) = cos √−𝐷𝜓 −   𝜃1     sin √−𝐷𝜓
angle between vector and real axis
In this case, you can write the pointer and trigonometrically elliptical number 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑝𝑦, given algebraically
where = + + +
Means
From the last equations for elliptic numbers, the basic trigonometric equilibrium is taken:
Rotate the affine plane
Formula = defines the rotation of the Euclidean plane at an angle in the Cartesian coordinate system
Here
That is, 𝑧 = 𝑒

Open this formula:
from here
Here
Then the transition from the affine system () to the affine system (), that is, we get formulas for expressing new coordinates through old coordinates:
𝜃0 = 5 𝜃1 = 4
Then the valid affine plane parameter determined according to these values ​ ​ will be 𝑝 = 2 + 𝑖, where 𝑖2 = − 1

This article reflects the course of interpretation of some topics of the course of probability theory using the Matlab software package
Particular attention is paid to the functions of concern and this is the scope of application
Basic properties of generating function are given
The probability was found that the number of boys in subsequent generations using properties is equal to a certain number
Examples of software package calculations are given
Insidious correlation function with correlation coefficient
Usually, when teaching basic courses, we limit ourselves to providing theoretical material for the program
But we think that this material can be interested using software packages, or it will be clear and interesting to the student, indicating where it will be used
However, in pure mathematics there are few that can be transmitted differently
This is due to the fact that if you take a course of mathematical analysis, then mainly those topics that are asked there greatly contribute to understanding the topic of other theoretical courses.
However, if you talk about these small topics, as soon as we can
Consider the concept of a random variable with a wide scope of application transmitted on the course of probability theory
Explanation of covariance, which can be considered as the magnitude of the relationship between two random quantities at one expense
Help:
where the expression 𝑋 − 𝐸𝑋 denotes the deviation of a random variable 𝑋 from its average value
In other words 𝑋 if the value of a random variable increases and the value of a random variable 𝑌 on average, then the value of the covariance between them is positive
Example 𝑋 random quantity - rainfall 𝑌 random quantity - crop quantity
Considering that the more precipitation, the greater the average yield, the more positive the covariance between random values ​ ​ in the example
If the value of the random variable 𝑋 also decreases on average as the value of the random variable 𝑌 increases, then the value of the covariance between them is negative
For example, consider the following random variables: 𝑋 random variable - age 𝑌 random variable of a person - the number of black hair of this person
Then we know that the older a person is, the less black hair on average.
So in this example
covariance between random values has a negative value
The case where the covariance is zero is the case where the change in the value of the random variable 𝑋 on average does not affect the value of the random variable 𝑌
For example 𝑋 random value - the number of rainy days in the city of Almaty per year 𝑌 random value - a value indicating the number of works of professors of any KazNU
That is, it is clear that the more rainy days, the less or more work on average professors of KazNU
Let us now recall the following property of the correlation coefficient between two random variables:
Reference	on	𝜌(𝑋 𝑌) = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑋𝑌)  𝑋 𝑌-	stable	sizes	otherwise
By definition, it is easy to prove the above property
However, in meaning, this property can be formulated as follows: the correlation coefficient does not have a unit of measure
As an example: [1]
We measure the correlation between a random variable and a random variable 𝑊 denoting length 𝐻
Consider two different units measuring the weight and length of a person: kilogram and centimeter (𝑊𝑘 𝐻𝑐) or gram and meter (𝑊𝑔 𝐻𝑚)
The indication with which unit the correlation can be measured is proof of the above property due to the paraffir 𝑊𝑘 = 𝑎𝑊𝑔; 𝐻𝑐 = 𝑏𝐻𝑚
Where 𝑎 𝑏 numbers are some positive constants
Now let's try to calculate the quantitative characteristics of a discrete random variable, given as follows, using the Matlab software package [2]
𝑋	accidentally	sizes	accepting	values	-1;	0;	1;	2;	5
Corresponding
probability 01; 03; 05; 005; 005
Specify the quantitative characteristics of the random variable given by the law of such distribution using the software package
(Mathematical care)
(Mean square deviation)
In the case of a continuous random variable, it is sufficient to replace the integral command instead of the connection
In this example, numeric characteristics were found for a very simple random variable
However, with the help of this program, it is possible to calculate for complex random types of variables, which, of course, will provide the student with great help
Also one of the topics in the course of probability theory
- generating functions and their properties
In explaining this topic, students would be interested to know where and under what circumstances it would be used
In general, when studying all basic disciplines, we sometimes answer the student's question where to use it, and sometimes leave unanswered.
In this regard, we consider it necessary to elaborate on the calling functions
On the other hand, the only method widely used in the theory of branching processes is the method of generating functions
The definition of the generating function is as follows: [3]
Aytalyk
𝑎0 𝑎1 𝑎2 … have a sequence of specific numbers
If
if the series in any interval is 𝑠𝑜 < 𝑠 < 𝑠0, then it is called the derivative of the chain function {𝑎𝑗}
Spontaneous 𝑠 variable does not matter
If the sequence {𝑎𝑗} is defined, we know that given the geometric progression, the series will be complex, at least at |𝑠| < 1
For example, 𝑗 for all 𝑎𝑗 =
A for 𝑎 = 1 𝑓 (𝑠) = 𝑒𝑠
If 𝑎
Consider the derivative of a random variable function
random quantity distribution (=) = = 0 1...
The derivative of a random variable function 𝑍
determined through
𝑃(𝑍 = 𝑗) = 𝑝𝑗 𝑗 = 0 1 … probability distribution
note (1) = 1
As a result, the absolute minimum for |𝑠| < 1 is simultaneously summed
At the same time, mathematical care and variance of random variable 𝑍 are calculated through calling functions: 𝐸𝑍 = 𝑓 1 (𝑉) 𝑍 () =
These two formulas are the simplest and most convenient for mathematical care and dispersion detection
Note that the derived function is now used in branching function theory
If in a certain population a distribution of the probability of birth of particles is given, then the generating function will give the law of reproduction in meaning
If the law of reproduction is given 𝑛 it will be possible to find out with what legality the generation will increase -
It is determined by the iteration of the 𝑛 th sequence of the generating function
Consider the report on the disappearance of noble families: "Let every man of the Jones clan be 𝑝𝑖 likely to leave the 𝑖 male generation
Let this probability not change when moving from generation to generation
Then why is the probability that a man of the genus Jones will become 𝑛 male offspring in the − th generation equal to the probability that 𝑘 = 0 𝑘
Gives the probability of losing a generation family
"This report
American mathematician Alfred Lotka, whose solution, of course, is known, received a simulation solution, 𝑝𝑖 the probability of considering it: 𝑝0 = 0
Before showing the solution, let's focus on the properties of the generating functions:
If random variables are independent, then () = () ();

If 𝑍 𝑋1 𝑋2... independent random variables and 𝐸 (𝑠𝑋𝑖) = 𝜙 (𝑠) then

If initially the population had 𝑖 fraction
That is, applying the 6th property 𝑛 we see that the number of generations - can be calculated by iteration [4]
To do this with the entry of the creator function
we get by finding the amount
instead of the argument in the function to apply the value
we find
Thus, if the probability that the 2nd generation will have two children is required, then it will be equal to the pre-serial multiplier in the function 𝑓2 (𝑠) 𝑠2-tyң
That is,

Dielectric conductivity of silicon dioxide of carbon sponge shells
Practical section
Boundary edges of silicon dioxide - silicon and carbon are obtained by magnetron spraying of a composite carbon target
As a result of the addition of carbon to the composition of the flakes, irreversible changes in their structure occur, as a result of which cavities are formed
The number of cavities in the scales depends on the area occupied by graphite in the silicon target of the magnetron
For quantitative characteristics of component guidance, parameter Sc is introduced, equal to ratio of area of occupied graphite disks to area of silicon target [1]
Pressure in vacuum chamber in air medium of spraying is 10-3 mm Hg. St

Concentration of C-O bonds in the shell SiO2 + C:
As we see in the calculations, the concentration of C-O bonds is less than in shallow scales
This is due to the fact that some sections of the edge area occupy cavities and gas connections

The IR spectrum of the molecule reflects a number of thin absorption bands corresponding to certain oscillations of any atomic group
The assignment of individual oscillations in the spectrum to a certain band is carried out on the basis of the generalized law of probabilistic frequency of oscillations of various types
It has been proved that the oscillations of atoms in the group of known atoms that are part of various molecules, through a comparison of the structure of chemical compounds and theoretical calculations of IR spectra, differ slightly, that is, it does not depend on which compound the transferred atomic group is included in
Such absorption bands are called descriptive bands.
This makes it possible to carry out qualitative and complete analysis of oscillatory spectra (transmission image spectra) [3]
Qualitative analysis of substances is carried out both on compounds, the spectrum of which is known when comparing with data in a fixed-spectrum bank (information search system) using the fingerprint method, and on nodes, the spectrum of which is unknown by using the method of structural-group analysis based on the detection of various structural groups in the molecule through a spectral descriptive band (expert system).
IR spectroscopy allows not only qualitative analysis, but also complete analysis
For optical spectra, there are general laws of absorption and illumination, giving a ratio of the amount of absorption and the amount of absorbing substances
The dependence of the absorption coefficient on the wavenumber can be used to estimate the coupling concentration of various substances, since the absorption band area is proportional to the coupling concentration
Due to the presence of the reference spectrum, a quantitative value of the bond concentration of the controlled sample can be obtained.
Based on the spectrum, it is possible to conclude about the oxide cavity
If the oxides have sufficient borpiles, it can be seen that their spectra have wide absorption bands [4]
The IR spectroscopy method is very comprehensive, allowing to control the entire aggregate state of substances
The following significant advantages of the spectral method can be noted: high sensitivity (even a unit allows you to record the spectrum of molecules) the strength of the substance under study
For example, for a baseband in this contract, a strip of 500-700 nm is usually
Band width for sufficiently dense and relatively complete thermal grown oxide Δγ = 120 nm
Silicon dioxide conductive film spectrum obtained
Figure 5 shows the IR spectrum of the film conductivity SiO2
Qualitative analysis of the spectrum shows that in the spectrum there are now different descriptive bands and the intensity of the bonds of C-O C-O and OH
This proves that they have an amorphous structure
Qualitative analysis of films was also carried out and the concentration of the approximate C-O d bond was calculated.

Conclusion
As a result of this work, the dielectric conductivity of flakes and the composition of flakes were studied to obtain spongy silicon flakes.
According to the results, we can conclude: the addition of carbon to the target of the magnetron - leads to an increase in the porosity of the resulting shell and the formation of gas compounds
This will be for the chemical reaction between oxygen and carbon
This leads to the formation of a volatile bond of CO or CO2, and as a result of takeoff from the dielectric shell, transition cavities and gas connections arise
At the same time, its dielectric conductivity and density decrease

Virtual laboratory work of new pedagogical technologies (IPT) together with information technologies (IT) in the physical education of future technicians and specialists in the field of medicine is one of the most promising topical issues of modeling practices and processes from physics using a computer
Virtual animated computer models show the teacher on the computer screen a lot of physical
allows you to organize new non-traditional student training activities to repeat processes with effects
Students under the guidance of a teacher or independently from a physics lesson use methods for measuring physical quantities when performing laboratory work both independently and from physical means, studying experiments and processes, and independently get acquainted with the ways of their assembly.
Currently, most lecture and laboratory sessions are aimed at improving various pedagogical software tools (PBC) for studying physics or MIC in physics, where they are carried out using computer programs
Its methodological orientation at the stage of development of modern science is an authoritative feature of the style of scientific thinking
Some laboratory work on teaching the subject provided by metering devices in accordance with the intensive development of PBC is carried out with programmed virtual animation technologies
Mathematical and physical modeling of physical phenomena and processes is rapidly developing and becoming one of the main methodological approaches to education
Therefore, in the period of modern development of physics, along with traditional cognitive methods, its new structure is also considered recognized

Also, with the development of a new methodology for teaching physics in vocational and higher educational institutions, it is carried out in various directions
The emergence of various programs that differ from each other in structure and content, the idea of ​ ​ computerizing the educational process of modern IT and IPT has an impact on the methodology of education in physics
However, the IBC cannot completely replace the physical laboratory, but independently complements each other
It does not take much time to complete them, so work in a virtual-animated form can be presented as an additional task to real experiments on a given topic

The article provides for the possibility of implementing a competent approach to physics education in a general secondary school
To implement a competent approach in a general secondary school, it is necessary to introduce new approaches in the educational process
In this context, the article presents some methodological approaches to the formation of key competencies of students on the example of issuing practically oriented reports on physics
Key competencies in general secondary school, teaching methods for issuing physical reports
Policy of integration of Kazakhstan into the world educational space requires updating the system of domestic school education on the basis of new principles and approaches to the goals of socio-economic and cultural progress of society
This is due to the fact that effective preparation of the school for the socialization of adolescents is the main level of the educational system that determines its ability to study throughout the life course
One of the priorities of the State educational policy in the country is the implementation of education based on competent consideration, the main directions of which are indicated in the "State program for the development of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020" [1]
Competence - a combination of knowledge of the skills and experience of actions of interrelated semantic guidelines necessary for the implementation of personal-socially significant and productive actions in relation to the forms of a specific reality [2; 3]
The study of the subject "Physics" within the framework of competent consideration should be aimed at ensuring that students can independently develop and determine their potential by teaching and forming key and subject competencies that are able to creatively apply the knowledge mastered for the development of cognitive abilities in life situations.
Key competencies will become a prerequisite for the formation of moral values ​ ​ and human motives, as well as the development of social and behavioral actions
Whatever the set of key competencies, they must meet two main criteria: community, that is, functionality, indicating that competencies can be applied to various areas of activity and types of activity and engage in any type of activity
Having analyzed the list of competencies from 3 to 37 proposed by various authors, we determined that in the study of physics they can be combined into three key competencies: communicative competence; competence to solve problems [4]
The possibility of physics in the formation of key competencies of students - information and communication competencies for solving problems, namely its high level of social and practical significance.
in the course of study, it is possible to include the use by students of various types of educational and cognitive actions to the practical application by students of knowledge that has mastered the applied orientation of the content of educational material
Let's consider the possibility of issuing physical reports when forming key competencies of students
The production of physics reports is both a source of knowledge and a method of training and occupies one of the main places in the teaching work
Physical accounting through the use of laws and methods of physics is a situation that requires them to think and practice so that students can apply it in practice to arming themselves with knowledge from physics and develop their thinking
The publication of physical reports contributes to the approval of knowledge and exercise in the application of studied laws, forms a special style of thinking
The latter is closely related to the methodology of physics as a science
The organization of students' activities in the production of physics reports is one of the conditions for ensuring their deep and strong knowledge, although the methods for issuing traditional physical reports are known.
Failure to take students into account may lead to a decrease in their educational achievements in the classroom
With each release of reports, specific methods and methods of educational activities are mastered, which in turn ensures the development of the individual
To develop the skills of school graduates, physical calculations must be widely used in the process of training tasks of a creative nature and requiring the application of mastered knowledge and skills to new conditions
And such attention to students' own activities requires a significant increase in educational time
In this regard, training courses implemented through the variable part of the curriculum, which contributes to the specialized differentiation of the content of education in high school and the professional adaptation of students, are of particular importance [4]
Therefore, teachers of disciplines need to consider ways of its rational use
The issuance of physical reports within the framework of a competent approach will contribute to the formation of competence of students to find solutions to problems
First, the production of physical reports uses the methods of scientific knowledge of the world in its arsenal and is itself, on the one hand, a method of their knowledge, since when issuing educational reports, students are armed with any methods
Such methods include individual methods, such as simulating ideal analog thinking modeling and predicting an experiment
They will contribute to the formation of educational competencies for the development of logical ideas of students, which are one of the main goals of physics education
Secondly, when issuing physical reports, trainees direct their knowledge to solve and implement the problem, which is an important component of educational activities
Thirdly, the issuance of physical reports develops the skills of students to conduct experimental research and carry out creative work
Any physical report can be formulated to be problematic
Such reports include reports of interest to students who lack or are overrepresented on daily life or have not even asked questions
So, for example, you can pay attention to the problem of interest to schoolchildren: why is the average speed of stayers, that is, long-distance runners, less than the average speed of sprinters, that is, runners at a distance of 200 m or less?
When solving this problem, they should come to the following conclusion: the runner should look for the reason why he cannot maintain his maximum speed for a long time, and not in physics.
The oxygen supply in the body is stored in the muscles and complements it with further respiration
Therefore, the rider can maintain his maximum speed only until the full consumption of oxygen reserve
Oxygen supply reaches a distance of about 300 m
Therefore, the farther the distance, the lower the speed of the rider so that he delivers an oxygen supply over the entire distance
During the competition, the runner tries to defeat his opponent
If the runner wants to break the record, his effective strategy is to adjust his average speed so that at the finish the oxygen reserves are depleted
Here, students understand that knowledge of the laws of mechanical movement needs living conditions
After such a discussion, they can submit reports as follows:
Sprinter can reach a speed of 102 m/s with uniform movement for 18 s
If the sprinter can maintain this speed up to 200 meters, how long will he get to the finish line?
When running at steer distances, for example, 1500 m, most runners slow down gusts to the middle belt of the road, and then make an impact flight to the finish line
Is this strategy right for creating a record? Can such a strategy increase the likelihood of winning such a race?
Give an example of a report that has not been asked
For example, after passing a new material on the free hit of bodies, a report will be made to better understand the phenomenon
Consider, for example, the standard report for determining the height of the vertical ejected body, discussed in the kinematics section
From a height of 5 m in the vertical direction at a speed of 20 m/s, any body was ejected
A report condition that has no questions about this report is a prerequisite for approval
The essence of such calculations is the identification of the mystery of the phenomenon, the identification of important mechanisms for its comprehensive consideration
After discussion, students develop questions of interest to them
When considering the report, the following questions can be discussed: can we drop any body up at a speed of 20 m/s? How does the body move? Up? Down? What height will the body rise to? Will this movement be free? What do we not consider in this case? At what speed the body falls to the ground and t
Students themselves determine how to determine the height of body lifting
The board displays coordinate axes that indicate the acceleration of the initial velocity of the original body coordinate
The necessary system of kinematic equations is written
Questions are discussed about where and at what speed the body falls to the ground after 1 s 2 s.
graphs y (t) and  (t) are compared with calculation results
Also, under kinematics, you can model using computer programs reports on the smoothness and motion of bodies thrown at an angle into the horizon in a uniform movement
This will contribute to the development of student information competencies
The essence of the formation of information competence in the study of physics is determined by the significance of physics as a science, created on the basis of the principle of conformity with the system of physical theories and the scope of application of these theories
Like this
for example, in the production of physical reports, along with traditional methods, an experiment is used to calculate information technology models and processes
Using the triple "Model - algorithm - program," students learn the basics of computer and mathematical modeling
Electronic directories to the main software subject when using information technology in the production of physical reports tabular processors MS Excel Mathcad Maple and t
there may be special computer programs [5; 6]
The use of information technologies in the production of physical reports will increase the knowledge of students in the discipline, which will teach a conscious understanding of the methods of knowledge in the field of science to work with information flows from different sources
Using computer programs, students issue reports on physics through the relationship and relationship data system
Program-based reporting consists mainly of four stages: analysis of accounting conditions; Select the order of reporting creation of a system of equations characterizing the phenomenon under consideration; conversion of the system of obtained equations and calculation of the desired values
When you issue physical reports using information technology, you can provide the following content:
Computational experiment
The role of the experiment in environmental knowledge
The role of computer technology in research and experimentation
Software tools for a virtual experiment
Table Processor Programming Systems for Mathematical Modeling of Natural Processes, Mathcad Math Package, etc.
software tools [5; 6]
Quantitative and qualitative physical calculations
Different Reporting Methods
Report Schema
Tabular Processor Programming Systems for Reporting, Eureka Math Package, etc.
software tools
Processing Study Results
Chart Building
Working with Table Data
Implementation of multimedia objects
When issuing physical reports, it is advisable to use special physical calculations to purposefully develop the communication competencies of students
Interactive methods can be used when issuing physical reports on communication competencies
These include organizing discussions about the release of physical reports
To do this, tasks will be proposed that promote active interaction of students
Students should be able to listen to the answers of classmates with a clear and consistent expression of their views in the discussion on the problem under consideration, be able to find conflicting views of the panelists when discussing and correctly ask questions to the panelists.
Such tasks offer situations aimed at reflecting communicative competence
For example: Is inertia a friend or a friend? Is natural radiation dangerous to life or is the truth inevitable? Can a speed exceeding the speed of light be achieved? Should nuclear power be developed? Energy-saving lamps - lamps equivalent to filament lamps? Is the electromagnetic field a friend or an enemy? Is a mobile phone a symbol of abundance or a means of communication? Global warming: who is to blame and what to do? Electrical charges - auxiliary or harmful in production? Topics will facilitate discussions among students
Thus, we considered the possibility of physical calculations in the implementation of a competent-oriented educational model using the example of physics
We believe that, in general, the implementation of the new model of education will make it possible to implement the real variation of the substantive and procedural foundations of school education and implement the principle of continuous improvement of the quality of education
In general, a competent approach focuses the learning process on practical results, contributing to the implementation of the effective nature of education
And this will contribute to the development of the personal, intellectual and socio-cultural qualities of the student, reflected in his communication with people mastered in his activities in solving various issues.

Scanner probe microscopy is one of the main methods among modern methods of studying morphological and regional properties of a solid surface with a high ability to distinguish [4-5]
Over the past 10 years, the scanning probe microscope has become a widespread tool for investigating the properties of solid surfaces from a very sensitive method available only to limited groups of studies
To date, none of the methods used in practice to study the relief of solid surfaces is scanner zone microscopy
without method
Atomic scanner probe microscopy served as the basis for the discovery of new nanotechnology technologies
They are tunnel magnetic-power electro- and optical near-field scanner microscopies [6-8]
The scanner probe microscope was discovered in 1981 by Swiss scientists Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer

Ensuring the information and life security of society and the entire state through effective ways and methods for people-consumers of various fields of application on a wide range of the latest innovation and technological process in conditions of dynamic development of information technologies is the main goal set for global publishers
In this line we will consider the use of the method of identity identification by means of the biometric method
This article provides and analyzes the types of software resources, methods and algorithms for the study of areas and uses with a description of the concept of personality identification through the biometric method
Identification of identification biometrics of fingerprinting through the outer transparent skin of the eye through the shape of the facial form by voice identification
Introduction
The society in which we live embarks on the path to innovation and, together with time, introduces into the scope of non-existent opportunities and brings to life valuable works
Scientific works not only facilitate a child's positive influence on his daily life, but are also realized in continuous scientific and practical activities to ensure "only his own information security" of human life
The development of scientific and technological progress now includes the improvement of newly created technology, the creation of conditions for supporting the global information process and, accordingly, ensuring its security [1]
Information Security in Today's World Becomes a Major Challenge
Currently, the use of the authentication system through the password cannot reliably provide security
Password must be more complex to achieve maximum security
The complexity of the password is characterized by the combined use of numbers and characters
We remind you that each information resource advises you to create your own password
And sometimes there are many cases when users forget their password, and in such conditions you have to identify a person who has contacted the password recovery services department
Also, the use of the password installed on the unauthorized password system of the identification system is not reliably protected.
That is, the same person can easily cure information belonging only to another person, using password hacking methods for his benefit
In this regard, biometrics for identity identification are most commonly used to improve information security
The scope of identification of an individual using the biometric method as a whole is the most effective method of development every day
Foreign and domestic scientists working in the field of identity identification by biometric method:
The territory of application of biometrics includes the following services: state registration authorities (biometric passport) of the financial service of the law enforcement industry (ATM bank), electronic commerce enterprises, hotels, airports, schools, shopping centers
Biometric technologies are most commonly used to control access to crime and to recognize the identity of citizens [2]
Domestic and foreign companies are actively working on the use of biometric technologies
For example, USA China Australia Japan India and Russian companies
Kazakhstan Institute of Information and Computing Technologies conducts basic research in the field of identity identification by biometric method
And the Kazakh company Laton LLP has its own unique patented products in the territory of identification of an individual by a biometric method: one is identification through finger signs, the second is an identification system through a species figure
From the point of view of international experts in the field of biometrics, the products of the domestic company Laton are among the most powerful in the biometrics market in the world
At the same time, a system called "Video++" together with functioning is being developed in three-dimensional biometric technology, which we understand as a rapid step towards the development of domestic science and the protection of national security [3]
Information and software
Several programs based on various mathematical methods and algorithms function in personality identification
For example, identity identification by voice can be performed using the MatLab and LabView application environment
PhotoModeler also used in dynamic identification
Biometric identification uses Oracle to create and securely store information systems
There are other software centers: Diagnostic Pak Tuning Pack Change Management Pack and Configuration Management and
In image processing, Daugman Houjane Haar methods are used to determine the outer transparent envelope of the eye if the Kanni algorithm is used
In addition, the classic methods used in biometric technology include the Wildes Boles Noh methods.
Along with these methods, mathematical modeling occupies a special place
Mathematical modeling can be written using a mathematical message between a component of an object shape
As a result, the investigated process or mathematical characteristic of the event arises, that is, its mathematical model is created [45]
Classification of the biometric method
Biometric identification is divided into the following types:
and the static method is based on the properties of unique data obtained from a person and its other features
Physiological indicators for humans
is considered unchanged
Static method: a shape of a palm of fingers with visible side of a palm an internal mesh cover of an eye an external transparent cover of an eye a form of the person DNA and t
identifiable views
dynamic method is based on behavioral characteristics of personality
These features are aimed at movement in performing any out-of-consciousness actions (dynamics of the keyboard set of the speech signature)
Such behavioral characteristics are subject to a state of influence on controlled and unruly mental factors
Biometric samples must be updated before use due to variability
Several linear functions are calculated to identify dynamic parameters
Orthogonal functionals such as Fur UolShaara will be selected as linear functionals
They are calculated in the form of all performed (global functionality) or some parts (local functionality - for example, for each letter of a word) [5]
The method of identity identification by means of the biometric parameter Word fingerprinting comes from the Greek word dactylos - finger + scopeo - look
Fingerprinting was considered one of the most common recognition methods
Fingerprinting method works a lot in forensics
It was founded in 1877 at the initiative of the English scientist William Herschel on the basis of the hypothesis of the invariability of the image of the lower leg on the upper skin of the human palm
In the fingerprinting method, skin patterns at the ends of unique fingers are used for each person (Figure 1)
Gets the image of the signature character through a special scanner
Then it switches to the digital code and is checked against the pre-entered template
You can define two main types of sign on each finger: global and local (local)
Global sign - a sign that can be seen with your eyes without any means
Local sign - the section of ice line structure change is unique for each finger sign in determination of direction and coordinates of ice paths (separation of end into two) [6]
Currently, the United States supports ANSI and FBI standards
Figure 1
Fingerprinting method
These standards have special requirements:
each video is presented in TIF format without compression;
image capability must be at least 500 dpi;
the video should be in color when lighting 256 levels;
main type of minute - end and division by two
Methods used in fingerprinting:
Method of Defining Main Characteristics (Global)
This method detects the main finger signs (core delta)
The number and mutual arrangement of these signs allow you to classify the type of lines
The linetype is considered available for determining the temperament and possibility of human behavior
Graph-Based Definition Method
Initial image of finger sign (1) is processed on image of edge directed to papillary line (2)
Here (2) denote the boundaries of these two zones since the same path directions are known
Then the center of these zones is defined and a graph is created
Types of fingerprint scanners (Figure 1):
optical;
ftir scanners;
fiber optics;
optical;
rings;
contactless;
semiconductor;
radio frequency;
ultrasound;
The identification process lasts several seconds
The lack of further development of this method is influenced by the opinion of some people outside, that is, they do not want to leave information about their fingers
As a reverse approach to this opinion, the drafters of the fingerprint method conclude that only a short identification code without finger information will be preserved
The advantages of this method are simple, reliable and easy to use
Fingerprinting Questions
Diagnostic examination of finger signs:
the age category of the person who left the fingerprints;
to which sex (male or female) is the person who leaves the finger marks;
finger signs (right or left hand);
how long the fingers are in the substance;
any features of the fingers of the person who left the fingers (scarring skin diseases and t.
Identification through the outer transparent sheath of the eye
The technology for scanning the outer transparent skin of the eye was first invented in 1936 on the recommendation of the famous ophthalmologist Frank Burch
The outer transparent shell of a human child is a unique formulation of uniqueness for each person
And in 1994, Iridian Technologies researcher J.
Daphman patented the algorithm for this method
The basis of this method in the distinctive expression of the outer transparent eye shell (Figure 2)
Its implementation requires special software and a high-quality camera for photographing eyes
Thanks to this, a digital code will be created that performs identity identification functions
The monochrome type of scanner uses the visible and infrared color part of the spectrum (700-900 nm)
Uses the 2-D Gabor filter algorithm from the resulting finished image and divides them into several vectors
Scanning is carried out at a distance of less than 1 meter
The most common kind of algorithm for determining the ray shell of the eye is a free circle that determines the parameters of the ray shell
The main anatomical structure of the outer transparent skin of the eye is the relief and color of the pattern
The following algorithms and mathematical methods are applied to this type of identification: Daugman's method, Howe's method and Haar's method, Canny's algorithm and Gabor Gauss filter and Laplace operator
Among these methods and algorithms, the Canny algorithm is used to determine the pupil of the eye
Canny's algorithm applies a horizontal and vertical gradient to determine the pupil border of the eye in the figure
After processing images using the Canny algorithm, a circle is formed that accurately determines the boundaries of the pupil of the eye
The integrodifferential Daugman method in this territory is considered a canonical process, that is, it is used together with the Howe method due to unsatisfactory results
Another method is the Gabor filter
Gabor filter is used when detecting key points for determining the outer transparent skin of the eye
Gauss filter and Laplace operator are also used
Figure 2
Identification through the outer transparent sheath of the eye
Compression technology through the outer transparent eye shell is part of the extensive use of mobile phones and computer products in the use of ATM systems [9]
Page Shape Identification
Such a static identification method is created when creating a double or three-dimensional type of face shape of a person
Noses and t shells around the eyes to represent the facial shape with the help of a camera and a special trained program
indicated by distinguishing lines
Then the distance between these elements and other indicators is calculated
Digitized to match this data with video
The form of several pages is shown in Figure 3
This approach relates to the dynamically developing direction of biometrics (Figure 3)
Its advantage does not require a special expensive device
Only a personal computer and video camera is enough
Has no physical contact with another device
That is, you do not need to press anything or stop, you only need to wait for the release of the special system

Voice identification
Using the biometric method of voice identification is considered convenient
The reason is the introduction of microphones on the computer and the spread of telephone networks
Describing several factors as defective, they negatively affect recognition: interference in the microphone, errors in the hearing environment of noise, as well as various emotional states of faces during the identification process, etc.
influences
The main thing in creating a voice identification device is to select parameters that characterize your own voice properties
The parameter of this signal is called a different sign
Such designations must contain different properties when the voice is different
For example, they should be easy to measure and less dependent on noise and obstacles
At the same time, they must be constant at the exact time and resist dyes [11]
Conclusion
Judging by the large-scale and effective work in the field of biometrics, the territory of identity identification opened its way to the future
All innovations and innovative technologies have formed a wide range of opportunities to clarify and simultaneously simplify the identity identification system and have become a new publisher of new times

The dynamic development of modern computer systems is characterized by an increase in the information collected and sent to many users
However, if integrity is needed with the availability of information, there is an increase in the number of users for whom the confidentiality of some data is important

The article presents models of word synthesis and word synthesis
The human hearing system contains many components, which are a very complex system
In modelling such an integrated system, the use of audio information and processing mechanisms is differentiated
Separately, an analysis of sinusoidal models of the Kochler model auditory nerve model for the formation of speech synthesis models is given.
Synthesis of words based on a sinusoidal model with anthropomorphic processing
Among these models, the importance of using a sinusoidal model is emphasized
Fourier Kohler auditory nerve model sinusoidal vocoder anthropomorphic processing peripheral model
Information technologies are developing dynamically in the world, so a high-quality and fast transfer of information through digital channels is an important solution.
The main type of communication between people, regardless of the types of means used, is the exchange of information through speech signals
In this regard, digital speech processing and delivery methods are currently developing dynamically and improving in the world
Digital processing provides guaranteed protection of communication efficiency [1]
Minimize the number of bits required for signal transmission
Currently, one of the current problems is the creation of a signal processing system with low and high-quality perception of signal speed, capable of working in a global environment
This method is used in linear prediction and coding of the time area, where a method of synthesizing a high-quality speech signal with a transmission rate of more than 8 kbit/s is created.
Currently, a method for restoring word quality at a rate of about 2 kbps is being developed.
For this range, the use of sinusoidal analysis technology and the human hearing model provides a great opportunity
The parameters of sinusoidal component variation at the time interval, frequency and amplitude phase of the sinusoidal components can be represented by sinusoidal processing of any signals whose index is based on the sinusoidal prediction
The main disadvantages of sinusoidal systems are the impracticality of encoding and forwarding speech signals according to the quality of providing a large number of parameters of a low-speed speech signal.
Degrades the root quality of speech with a limited number of sinusoidal components (parameters: frequency and amplitude phase)
To solve this problem, it is now proposed to limit the amount of information encoding the sinusoidal encoders in any way [4].
Sinusoidal encoders in the art are promising with the ability to reduce word information presented in large volumes when processing anthropomorphic word signals
In such systems, a typical scheme of word analysis is presented (Figure 1)
Coding and quantization
Figure 1
Table of sinusoidal analysis with anthropomorphic treatment
Figure 2
Coder Structure
Sending a sinusoid parametric reference is quantum and encoded [6]
Parameters received on the decoder side are decanted and decoded, and amplitude phase frequency analyses are added when analyzing sinusoidal components accumulated by the synthesis process
To obtain speech quality, interpolation of systematic sinusoid and parameters is used
Distribution of components with predominant frequency
The computational process uses the process methods and algorithms occurring in its auditory and speech production systems to simulate the use of "anthropomorphic signal processing" devices and information processing algorithms
A fairly accurate simulation of this system is used for useful properties such as their physiological alternative
The human hearing system contains many components, which are a very complex system
In modeling such an integrated system, problems arise with the differentiated use of audio information and processing mechanisms
Not only increasing the algorithmic and computational complexity of modeling the elements of the "secondary," but also complicates the interpretation process when obtaining the result
At the same time, regardless of the model of applied algorithms, the human hearing system usually consists of two interconnected parts: the peripheral (external environment and internal ear) model of auditory nerves (partially auditory nervous system with a straight cell and acoustic analyzer of parts of the brain model of pulse processing)
When modeling the inner ear (poisons), the movement of the basilar membrane is described under the influence of mathematical acoustic oscillation and the main function of the basilar membrane of the inner hair cells of spectral decomposition is
Depending on the correctness of the entire model at the auditory nerve level, it is important to note accurate and exemplary processing
To successfully solve the above issue, it is necessary not to model the processes lying in the peripheral parts of the human hearing system, but to circulate analysis of information disseminated at the level of auditory nerves
It is also necessary to take into account the results of the auditory model, allowing it to be used in combination with the sinusoidal model
The combination of auditory model depending on frequency priority is shown (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Combining depending on the frequency priority of the auditory model
Kochler model
The human hearing system is recommended as a peripheral model called SDCM-
SDCM (Second order Difference Cochlea Model) - cochlear model of the second difference sequence [5]
b1k b2k ak i a0k - basilar parameters
physical properties of membrane at position xc are determined
Auditory nerve model
Real physiological processes of auditory model are human auditory abilities to a good extent [7]
The result of the model allows you to get an idea of ​ ​ acoustic information about the level of rotation of nerves, which is an auditory histogram G (ft)
The signal of the word "important" for human hearing with its help is analyzed by level using frequency generators
However, for a sinusoidal model, the use of this model is difficult from the point of view of "compatibility"
In addition, it has high computational complexity, which makes it difficult to process word signals in real time
In this case, histograms in the calculation recommend changing the process G (tf), eliminating the above drawbacks and at the same time preserving its useful properties
One of many actions is the possibility of drastically reducing the complexity of computational analysis of the translation algorithm from time to frequency area, as well as the best solution for compatibility with spectral analysis of the sinusoidal model.
When processing the frequency area of input speech signals through cochlear filters, it is allowed to provide the function of discrete frequency G (k) using the hearing histogram G (tf) (Figure 4)
Signal revenue c (n)
Figure 4
Calculation of the transformed auditory historama
The histogram G (k) is calculated by the following expression:
Fourier Transform
Distinguish between complex (non-periodic) signals
set of frequency harmonic oscillations (sinusoid cosine)
can be considered as
For this purpose, a direct Fourier transform is used:
Inverse fourier conversions:
To classify the signal studied in practice, other functions are used that reflect its specificity and ensure the rapid accumulation of the integral
For example, to analyze particularly homogeneous signals (singular), it is convenient to convert a wavelet, the basic function of which is urgently isolated (compared to a harmonic function)
x () spectral function, and its amplitude spectrum module () - argument - is called phase spectrum
Conversion of function (1) to frequency communication depending on time
The more information in the original t (x) signal, the more information is contained in the spectral x ([omega]) function
Conclusion
As a result of this work, we used anthropomorphic processing and synthesis of speech signals based on the sinusoidal model
For the sinusoidal model, methods of circumventing difficulties were considered, since the use of some models is difficult from the point of view of "compatibility"
Determined parameters of selection of sinusoidal components of speech signals separated by reception of input signal (amplitude of frequency phases)
When solving the compression problem and minimizing the number of bits needed to transmit a signal, the degree of understanding and reliability of the announcer is increased

The article will discuss the use of information and communication technologies in the process of training in informatics
Relevance of ICT tools in the training process
Basic concepts and terms of electronic educational resources are analyzed
The importance of using e-learning tools in the learning process will also be considered in general.
The structure of electronic tutorials and their difference from a regular textbook are given
Innovations in information and communication technology education e-media education e-textbook
Now in each educational institution, teachers not only provide students with education, but also demand from today's teacher issues of developing the abilities of creative thinking the intellectual potential of developing professional competencies from future pedagogical specialists
The training process characterizes the stable pedagogical relations of the teacher and student
Modern educational standards of the next generation are based on the technology of personal-oriented education, on a competent approach
In the work of many researchers in this direction, it is possible to see the effective organization of education through the means of information and communication technologies in accordance with individually oriented learning technologies
The main goal of vocational education is the training of qualified specialists with high responsibility in the labor market who have developed competencies that meet the requirements of competitive time
The use of pedagogical methods that allow rapid adaptation to the changing conditions of the modern information society is one of the priority areas of pedagogical theory and practice
Halikova notes that given the fact that the existing education system is aimed at individually oriented technologies, one such method is the project method based on integration with information and communication technologies [1]
It will ensure high motivation of students to develop new knowledge, increase the sense of responsibility for working with group actions
As you know, the training process is currently focusing on innovation
Innovations in pedagogical action require, first of all, the introduction of innovation in production, the updating of pedagogical technologies used in the educational process, and changes in them
The introduction of novelty or innovation, since it is characteristic of many professional actions of a person, requires analysis and its implementation into practice
Innovations do not appear independently, they are the result of advanced pedagogical experience of researchers and scientific research
This process is of a different nature and is a managed process [2]
The goal of innovation in education: ensuring a high level of intellectual, physical and spiritual development of the student; the style of scientific thinking towards them
Creating conditions for skills development; study of methodology of novelty introduction in socio-economic and professional spheres; Building a sustained interest in innovative offerings
The use of information and communication technologies is one of the elements of innovative technologies
Each teacher lesson organized must have creative work
Therefore, the consistent use in the organization of the lesson of the rules for training in modular individual training and training in the separation of educational materials into factual and applied parts depending on the level of ensuring independence and mastering the subjects of the elements of mutual training (fragments of electronic textbooks, special tests, computer report sets, reference books of demonstration files
) use of information and communication technologies as an integral part
The capabilities of modern information and communications technology require the improvement of the educational process and the creation of conditions for the effective achievement of the goals set
As an advantage of this approach: (a) high learning performance; b) flexibility and flexibility of the system for various educational institutions; c) easily changed and supplemented by the system (tasks in the file are easily changed, Web tutorials are easily changed); d) universality of their application (efficiency, including independent work and educational process) [3]
The reason why in the field of education it is important to introduce in the area of ​ ​ hardware telecommunications and software equipment work with practical (or special) not industrial, that is, an effective solution, can guarantee their practical need and the effectiveness of its further continuation
Accelerated development of information technologies leads to cheaper production costs of hardware and software, as well as harmonization of programs and devices in the main areas of ICT development
Timely resolution of issues arising in the implementation of ICT in practice requires improvement of work in the field of informatization of school education
In particular
methodological equipment of educational institutions;
Pay special attention to the training of teachers and administrative authorities;
improvement and efficient use of application software (encyclopedias in management of the administrative and economic complex of copper-resource modeling);
special name has such issues as the implementation of full hardware support (computers are connected to the Internet of the local network)
Ultimately, introducing ICT into the learning process is a complex challenge, both technically and psychologically.
Today, teachers of both schools and universities cannot work without computers, they need a computer as a means of performing their professional functions [4]
Let's talk about the use of computer technologies in the field of education
The wide introduction of new computer technologies of education in the educational process in higher and special educational institutions develops the independent and creative activity of students and contributes to the performance of independent types of work
Note some of the ICT tools currently being used in the training process
Computer presentations
This, on the one hand, gives students new material (photo illustrations figurative didactic materials
c) in the presence of a means of visual demonstration, on the other hand, makes it easier for teachers to prepare these materials and the process of their use
The use of best practices increases the motivation of students to learn, ensuring interesting passage of the lesson, shortening the preparation time for it (when the teacher or someone else prepares the work on presentation support), and most importantly, instructs teachers to use new computer technologies
The use of computer technology to test student performance and improve student knowledge will, first, increase teacher productivity and devote more time to testing learning outcomes; secondly, assess the knowledge gained by children, following them objectively; thirdly, introduces scientific elements into control technology and creates conditions for its wide use
Distance learning - a form of education through information and communication technology (multimedia telecommunications computers) and science-based approaches (day-to-day correspondence)
Today, this technology is very common
Advantage of distance learning:
a) quickly brings to the student educational materials of computer telecommunications;
a) provides an opportunity to create a virtual classroom capable of organizing communication between students and the teacher in real time through teleconferences;
b) Enable the use of all information and communication technology capabilities for both learning and student feedback [4]
Today, multimedia technologies are important among ICT tools used in education [5]
This is a set of methods and methods in which data of various types is processed using information and software equipment, attempts to combine.
The development of multimedia technologies is carried out as a result of the development of video technology and personal computer
Multimedia provides the proper provision of static dynamic and audio information
The term "multimedia" means an "information environment" consisting of a combination of the Latin word "multi" (many) and "media" (average)
Multimedia in education - a didactic information and software tool that presents in an interactive form the content of education that contributes to the improvement of the cognitive process
Multimedia is a technology for sharing information of various types with a user
According to researchers, 25% of the material transmitted by the traditional method of training - 33% - visual and auditory, 50% - multimedia interactive training programs.
Electronic encyclopedias written on laser discs, which are an integral part of multimedia, occupy a special place in the process of teaching textbooks and dictionaries
For example, electronic dictionaries contain not only a translation of each word, but also its example of pronunciation
New reading due to the fact that multimedia technologies are currently reflecting the dynamics of phenomena and transmitting the volume of educational information in a certain sequence
of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Tobacco to reflect the use of information and communication technologies through e-learning resources
The main goal of electronic educational resources is to improve the quality of education of students and students, provide scientific and methodological assistance to teachers, organize their independent educational activities [5]
The use of electronic resources will expand the range of traditional classes and significantly increase the information environment by visually perceiving the educational process, that is, the main feature and effectiveness of this process will be conducted visually through the connection between the student and the teacher.
Electronic edition is a graphic text digital music video photo and t
information as well as a set of printed data
Magnetic electronic edition (magnetic tape magnetic disk t
) optical (CD- ROM DVD CD-R CD-I CD + and t
) may be on electronic media and published in electronic computer networks
Electronic educational publications (electronic textbooks and electronic textbooks (posobie)) - an electronic publication that allows you to determine the educational trajectory and various educational activities in accordance with the training course and its separate sections based on the control and automation of knowledge
The electronic textbook is developed in accordance with the state educational standard containing the systematic content of the training course and its sections, provided that simple textbooks are reference tasks and laboratory practices, etc.
e-learning publications clearly approved by public authorities,
Electronic textbook - a virtually fixed edition of the state standard of education, which can replace a full and partially electronic textbook
Electronic training means are trainers (simulators) of reference and diploma working projects of reference and encyclopedic works on typical subjects and collections of exercises and tasks on the curriculum in specialties and specialties, the most significant state general education standards, standard educational areas.
In addition, electronic educational products are known
Diagnostic programs - programs used to check the level of intellectual development of assessing students' skills in preventing erroneous actions
An object-oriented environment allows you to model readable objects or their relationships in a specific object environment
With their help, patterns associated with some subject areas of educational activity will be organized
Coaches (coaches-teachers of programs) - special programs, improving skills and skills in educational activities
Programs also designed to repeat the past of independent work
The Learning Data Foundation is a truly created and organized set of electronic information
Electronic course cases - a given course located on a CD, and a set of educational and methodological materials of all disciplines indicated in the curriculum of the specialty
Basic requirements of informatization of education in accordance with the requirements of the present
one is the introduction of e-learning resources into the learning process
Because in today's sphere of education, only what teachers say and the use of textbooks does not meet the requirements of today's education system
Effective use of ICT is therefore now time-consuming
One of the main internal e-learning publications -
is an electronic textbook
The structure of an electronic textbook can be conditionally divided into two: invariant and variable

The article gives two copyright concepts of e-portfolio - as information and communication technology and as a fractal form, which is a projection of individual training on the plane of achievements and results
The authors disclose an important characteristic of the structure as e-portfolio variability
Four levels of interaction in the process of education based on portfolio technology are identified and described: strategic tactical operational and situational levels
A systematic list of requirements for e-portfolio components is given
E-portfolio variable fractal form information and communication technology strategic level tactical level operational level situational level
The development of information and communication technologies is being actively introduced as one of the criteria for the success of their educational process, offering criteria for the variability of the structure
The requirements of variability are due to the need to take into account the effectiveness of educational phenomena and forms in a soft system [1]
The author's concept "Fractal form, reflecting the level of their formation and the degree of personal development and giving personal results in education," reflecting the professional and personal competence of the e-portfolio of the individual and
Based on the concept of "portfolio educational technology as a focused development and professional competence of information and communication technologies of a person providing interactive interaction and objectivity of materials provided in order to manage knowledge in information networks involved in achieving and reflecting personal achievements and educational results of a portfolio," assigns the e-portfolio model structure as a fractal form
Interaction during the educational process is carried out at four levels: strategic tactical operational and situational
of the Republic of Kazakhstan

Taking into account the self-determination of students;
e-portfolio identification of ongoing learning challenges and ways to alleviate them;
monitoring the activities of students;
filling and replenishing the e-portfolio structure
Shows that all these types of services have ambiguous variability and diversity of variations
The use of e-portfolio in the educational process, taking into account all possible aspects, is aimed at the end result - the formation of professional competence and will ensure the quality of the educational process
Thus, the e-portfolio of studies at the university is used by the authors of electronic tools and resources; influencing the manifestation of diversity of personal and professional achievements; Understands the interactive mutually beneficial interaction of educational processes in order to manage knowledge in information networks as a personal-oriented information and communication technology for monitoring the results of educational activities, aimed at organizing independent work that provides their accessibility
Based on a systematic approach, researchers develop various ways to design educational phenomena, based on improving their design chain as an educational technology of a typical e-portfolio structure and present as follows:
Identification of contradictions;
Identifying the possibilities for changing and changing the education system to address them;
determination of general and special professional competence and personal quality;
Identification of proposed educational outcomes and description of relevant e-Portfolio structural elements;
description of the primary and final e-portfolio state of the design form and their comparison;

test evaluation and practical verification of the received project;
addition to the amendment of the draft
in Table 1	authorship	with the team	designed	e-portfolio	technology requirements
Requirements for components of the e-portfolio variable structure
Taking into account the synergistic effect characteristic of the E-portfolio technology, the following requirements can be distinguished at the level of the entire object:
focusing on the formation of professional competencies and personal development of students;
The existence of a unique fund of information resources for educational and professional purposes;
effectiveness of learners' knowledge generation;
successful opportunities for information interaction in conditions of uncertainty;
integrity of information and pedagogical interaction in order to achieve as a socially significant result the formation of professional competencies and knowledge of students
These requirements provide for the implementation of the following principles of education in a new educational environment:
free use of various information systems;
personal orientation of the learning process;
development of information culture;
the openness of education to the future;
changing the role of PPP and trainees in the training process
List of basic requirements for teachers:
integrated environment for preparation of multimedia technologies of network courses and network communications - rapid development and operability of network educational and communication technologies;
possession of a certain psychological stability and work with virtual students whom the teacher does not see during the training of his students;
operate under distributed time conditions;
The preliminary preparation of the necessary components of its course should form a clear calendar of events during the course training and all types of reporting;
willingness to exchange information very actively with students; network technologies of education without active interview and network communications such as "student-teacher (s)" and "student-student (s)" are given an improved type of harsh learning in the form of previous correspondence; Actively encouraging and encouraging trainees to carry out their training tasks using networking technologies; timely information of students on the results of tests and control tasks of the current academic performance of students; readiness to change course content constantly enough
One of the most important characteristics of education as a system is the uncertainty of their sequence
In this regard, based on the methodology of fuzzy modeling (mathematical modeling based on the theory of Fuzzy Sets), the following types of uncertainties characteristic of the e-portfolio [2] can be determined as a fractal form:
the use of dichotomous features in the description of the indicative indicator "high-low," in which "developed" - the ambiguity of the description of the criteria of components and indicators in the independent case of uncertainty of the system boundaries;
lack of unambiguity in the semantics of individual terms used to construct a conceptual model of the system, such as medium-quality education;
incomplete model transmissions on education and ICT in a contact environment with weak solutions;
contradictions of individual components of requirements satisfying model gear models and e-portfolio
For example, the conformity of the normative documents, the implementation of which regulates the educational process, and the satisfaction of consumers with the implementation of a personal-oriented approach to the individualization of education;
stochastic (uncertainty of the presence of any event)
Analysis of the trend of the sequence of the system in a given case does not give grounds for an unambiguous answer to the question "Will the literacy of the student be formed at a given level in a certain period of the future"
Uncertainty of personal requirements of trainees in e-portfolio indicators
Uncertainty of the educational process
Thus, the e-portfolio is displayed in the uncertainty of the model and is characterized primarily by uncertainty in the unclear type of system boundaries, as well as its revenue and expenditure actions with some cases [3]
In our study, we used the following methods to form fuzzy set theory [4-5]
It is recommended to abandon the classical set theory of improper or improper set of any element
Enter a special characteristic function called the set degree estimation function
Generalizes the concept of belonging to the set of an element that leads to blurring the boundaries of the set
We propose that the e-portfolio independent of its structure as a fractal form is determined by the following components: objective and subjective (mandatory for all) and variable (filled at the request of the creative student) components
Portfolio structure is fractal
Portfolio structure used in training future informatics professors:
at the level of the educational subject - the educational e-portfolio of the student;
at the specialty level - e-portfolio of vocational education of the student
The E-Portfolio structure returns a table consisting of two rows and two graphs in Figure 1.
Lines are divided into objective and subjective sections, and graphs - into invariant and variable

goes
Other cells in the table are significantly different from each other
The variable section and e-portfolio of education in a subject with a subjective component of the e-portfolio of vocational education of a student are similar to the list of tasks, but in the e-portfolio of vocational education electronic students are well prepared

The article will consider the organization of laboratory classes in the training of informatics subjects for future teachers of informatics
Analysis of the relevance of this study in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Basic concepts relating to laboratory occupations are defined
Main tasks of the laboratory workshop are envisaged
Main types and general structure of organization of laboratory classes in higher educational institutions are given
Features of laboratory workshops in the training of future informatics teachers are also envisaged
Organization of a laboratory workshop on information disciplines and frontal cycle design method
Practice shows the need of society for people who, in the context of the dynamic growth of the socio-political and economic status of the Republic of Kazakhstan, can actively influence the increase in the competitiveness of the state, affecting developing ideas in accordance with real changes that can think of intellectually developed talent
Aspiration of Kazakh society to global educational standards of educational system reform ensuring creation of favorable conditions for realization of their intellectual and creative potential for development of children who have developed talented intellectual potential
strategic objective
In this regard, the Republic of Kazakhstan sets the task of training specialists who can think creatively in the framework of the reform of the higher education system
Improving the competitiveness of education for the adopted State Program for the Development of the Education System for 2011-2020 will be aimed at developing human capital by achieving quality knowledge to ensure sustainable economic development
In higher education: "
the need for an individual to achieve a high level of quality education in accordance with world educational practices that meet the needs of the labor market for the industrial and innovative development of the country "[1]
This question indicates the need to improve the organization of the educational process in the higher education system, increase the effectiveness of the training types of classes in higher educational institutions, improve the quality of training of specialists by introducing innovative technologies into the educational process
It requires the improvement of the quality of training of future specialists through the introduction of innovative teaching methods that determine the content and purpose of the types of classes taught in higher educational institutions, not limited primarily to changing the content of teaching special disciplines, methods and means of education in accordance with the requirements of the present [2]
One of the types of training in specialized and professional disciplines in the training of future informatics specialists is a laboratory workshop
The laboratory workshop is an important element of the educational process in higher education institutions, which ensures that students carry out their practical actions in a certain subject area
Laboratory classes are an intermediate link between students mastering theoretical materials at the in-depth level of lecture seminars, such as other types of practical classes, and their practical application
Laboratory classes provide a combination of elements of theoretical research and practical work
Students, performing laboratory work, have a good knowledge of the material in the program, some theoretically incomprehensible materials are revealed and mastered in this type of lesson.
Since these are laboratory works that also combine theory and practice, they have a significant impact on understanding the complex issues of science to students and their formation as specialists
The meaning of the laboratory (laboratory) word laboratory (laboratory) (Latin labor - labor-intensive hard work means overcoming labor intensity) reflects the established concepts associated with the use of physical labor and minds to search for previously unused methods and means to solve various problems in science and life
The word "workshop" is used to describe a specific system of practical training, and the basic meaning of the word "Greek workshop" means "action"
This suggests that this is a type of study that requires students to take significant action
Recently, comprehensive laboratory work has been widely distributed in universities to integrate theory and practice, especially in the context of approaching the reality used in the professional activities of the future specialist, laboratory work based on the use of various equipment is increasing
Laboratory work is theoretical knowledge in the process of training
is a form of independent practical work of students, allowing for experiments that provide in-depth fixation
The laboratory workshop for students is as follows:
deepening and affirming the knowledge obtained from the theoretical course through practical research in the laboratory conditions of the laws and rules presented at the lecture;
proficiency in the analysis of the results of the scientific experiment;
Develop initial planning and research skills
Documents related to the education system in high school indicate the need for further improvement of the laboratory workshop and its active application in the educational process as an important tool for improving the training of the future specialist
It should be developed in the direction of improving methods for organizing the updating of laboratory tools and methodological support
As you know, for some branches of science, when forming a course of study, it is difficult to select materials related to practical development
The most important part in the preparation of the laboratory program is the distinctive part of practical training, successfully solved on the basis of laboratory work
Therefore, when selecting a material teacher, the main task of all practices on the basis of which a training experiment can be conducted should be technical internal processes or studies of important phenomena occurring directly in nature.
However, this material should contain a methodology of modern scientific research related to special training of students
Indicates the need to emphasize the importance of each issue within the scope of the subject in the formation of the content of laboratory work, since without an experiment in the formation of its structure, the difficulty of understanding or assimilating these issues is taken as the basis
In general scientific and general engineering educational disciplines, laboratory classes will be introduced with materials that allow you to show the main laws of this science, on the basis of these materials form the ability to describe in detail processes and phenomena
Laboratory works organized in special disciplines should include actions and knowledge carried out in the practical and scientific actions of future specialists
By organizing laboratory works, the departments of universities take into account not only substantive tasks, but also the entire actions of students as future specialists in a certain industry
Continuity in the implementation of pilot training between departments is achieved as a result of the coherence of educational programs, including laboratory
There are several ways to establish an interdisciplinary link in the area of laboratory workshop
The main ones are: combining concepts with definitions and obtaining physical quantities under a single name; the course of the main lectures given in the subject discipline requires the introduction of students as ready-to-receive material considered in laboratory work
Thus, the establishment of a laboratory workshop should ensure that the course of professional disciplines is logically linked to other subjects in such a way that it learns the structure of this field of science as a whole as a system.
In total, in the professional activities of a graduate specialist of a university who owns theoretical material when compiling a laboratory workshop program
it is important to consider that they are not used efficiently over time
The main requirement for laboratory practice at the university should be the content of educational material and the type of organization of classes at such a level as to develop their creativity and independence in solving scientific and practical problems that ensure the development of active cognitive activity of students
Successful completion of laboratory classes depends on many components: theoretical practical and methodological training of the teacher depending on the level of organization of classes, as well as the state of the laboratory base and methodological support and the level of training of students and activity in classes
The type of organization of laboratory classes depends primarily on the number of students participating in the classes, the content and volume of material in the program, the number of laboratory works, the number of computers in the computer classroom and the adequacy of equipment necessary for installed software and other educational processes
In connection with these issues, the following types of laboratory classes in higher educational institutions are used: independent and mixed frontal cycles
The frontal type of laboratory classes recommends that all students simultaneously carry out work
This type of laboratory work ensures deep assimilation of educational material, since the procedure for performing laboratory work is carried out strictly in accordance with the lecture and specified exercises
Therefore, such work requires a high methodological level, since the teacher pays attention to only one work
In higher education institutions, in some cases, laboratory work with a cycle is required
Next, laboratory work is divided into several cycles corresponding to a certain section of the lecture course
4-5 laboratory works are grouped, based on the implementation of the same type of equipment per cycle
Students go from one cycle to another according to the specified schedule
The duration of these sections of the jewellery workshops, created in the disciplines relating to the organization of the cyclical type of laboratory work, will be approximately the same
Universities with the possibility of a laboratory base offer to organize and conduct an independent type of organization of laboratory work
In this type of laboratory work, the student performs all the work given in the program in the specified order
Under these conditions, students can work on different topics
The order of laboratory work in most of them may not coincide with the course of lectures, but the interest and tendency of each student to conduct research may be taken into account.
Laboratory work organized in higher educational institutions is a combined laboratory work that includes all the best aspects of these types of
At the initial stages of training, a frontal look is used, gradually moving from it to a cyclical and independent look
Whatever type of laboratory work, it must be performed independently by students
Three possible methods of performing laboratory work can be mentioned:
Student actions to ensure that the standard conditions specified in the laboratory workshop are met as a matter of priority;
independent search activity and independent work of students under the guidance or at the direction of the teacher, performing not the most difficult creative tasks;
use the knowledge of students who have received active creative activity
show the ability to work in the realities of sedentary life
In accordance with these circumstances, it is recommended that laboratory work be planned as follows:
execution of planned actions strictly specified for the first year students;
implementation of planned actions and transition to independent research activities for second-year students;
transition to full research activities supervised by a semi-professional for third and fourth year students
Organization and execution of laboratory works requires special training
It begins first with familiarization with the main objectives of the subject with the goals and objectives of teaching the subject with the corresponding educational and methodological support
In preparing for laboratory work, the teacher must first determine which main organizations and definitions of the content and volume of classes should be mastered by the student during the rule of law lesson
At the same time, during laboratory classes, it should be determined what knowledge the student needs to expand in depth and how to intensify the cognitive activity of students
A special place is occupied by laboratory work on the training of informatics specialists in pedagogical universities
For this reason, most information disciplines are accompanied by laboratory classes, the mastery of all the software used in the educational process is carried out in laboratory classes
The subject of preparation of WEB applications are programming disciplines (object-oriented programming system programming and Internet programming) and the data fund and the basics of artificial intelligence of information systems, studied on the basis of laboratory exercises almost inside information disciplines
The subject of programming in the training of informatics teachers will be studied from the first year
Laboratory works organized in the learning of the programming language of the first level of primary education are in most cases organized by front
The procedure for performing laboratory work often coincides with the topics of lecture classes
And laboratory work, organized in the training of object-oriented programming, is an independent work and gives priority to the creativity of students
When teaching object-oriented programming, the design method is applied to students [3]
Students will be provided with project topics, in accordance with the selected topic, students will be able to independently conduct research
General structure of laboratory classes organized in informatics disciplines:
topics of classes;
for the purpose of the exercise;
due to the concern of laboratory work;
independent tasks performed by students
The content of the laboratory work may contain methodological instructions and values necessary for performing the work of the proved part of the theoretical material in the form of a laboratory
This structure may vary depending on the type of laboratory work used
Independent organized type of laboratory work
work, since the work of the project can be completely devoted to one semester or time of one intermediate control
In mastering the possibilities of object-oriented programming, students have an increased interest, and in connection with the presence of each of them with a separate research topic, all students achieve a certain study result
Studies of students conducted on the project during the study of this subject continue with course and thesis (at present, due to the lack of course work in the pedagogical load, we conduct it in subjects)
Research works carried out in the process of studying the subject of programming serve as the basis for their formation as professional informants who are well versed in the subjects of a special and professional profession [2]
Research work within this discipline will increase the interest of students in the chosen specialty and increase confidence in their abilities in each student conducting research
Laboratories organized in specialized and professional disciplines are important for the training of future informatics teachers
It is impossible to limit the use of only an independent or frontal type of laboratory work in the study of special and professional disciplines for specialists in informatics.
For example, in laboratory works organized in the subject "Methodology of training in informatics," one should use a frontal independent cyclic and mixed type
Laboratory works organized according to the method of independent training in this discipline must be cyclic or mixed
In conclusion, the correct organized laboratory work in the training of future specialists will become the basis for their formation as professionals of their level

Marketing is an important tool for entrepreneurship in today's market economy
If this type of activity combines several economic and social aspects of the life of society and the state, then in mathematical modeling of applied marketing calculations it is necessary to take into account all the features of socio-economic systems and processes
The most important factor in business development is the policy of application in the field of solving problems in the market economy
Effective marketing policies directed to consumers at any time are required to deliver competitive products or services
Marketing activities of industry must have an accurate understanding of the distributed system of interests and needs of customers, consistent with products or types of services
In modern science, there are numerous definitions of marketing, explained by the variety of approaches
On the one hand, this management concept considers the way of thinking as its own philosophy of entrepreneurship [1]
This approach is based on the following basic principles: systematization of understanding of the market and its elements; unconditional customer interest priorities; inclination and active action to adapt to market requirements and
On the other hand, marketing is defined as a "mode of action," that is, a practical approach and a system of measures aimed at achieving success in the market [2]
Marketers presented Geldeyi "Marketing is a business philosophy of firms based on systematic market development (channels of spontaneous consumer production) in order to prepare and implement an effective strategy of individuals aimed at forecasting and meeting the needs of institutions by public associations"
definition of particular interest [3]
Also, marketing systematically studies expected thoughts about "behavior" of both individuals and institutions [4]
Marketing can be seen as a functional activity of an institution focused on finding target markets and ensuring their commercial achievements
The creation of any commercial institution largely equates marketing with the importance of business, since the goal is to generate profit
For this reason, we can say that marketing takes place in any commercial structure, even if these organizations do not have a place for a marketer employee
It is necessary to develop proposals for creation or further improvement of channel of distribution and events (marketing complex) in order to promote pricing of products of marketing company by means of market study and forecasting
That is, marketing research of the main marketing tool - product management
pricing includes managing sales channels for promotion products
Studying small business through economic and mathematical modeling is an urgent problem of small business, which is an important component of the economy [4 5 6 7]
For example, when linear programming solves marketing calculations of the following type as a mathematical method for choosing a suitable solution from a number of alternative solutions: rationally use material resources in optimal coloring of production materials when creating optimal impurities and kits when planning the routes of agents selling products when calculating optimal inventory values ​ ​ when preparing effective assortments on limited resources;
it is applied
Different marketing situations can be solved using game theory
Product assortment planning can be created in order to find the optimal solution to achieve strategies for entering the new market models of "behavior" of competitors
Game theory used to make decisions in conditions of uncertainty and risk in the marketing report is of particular importance [6]
There is a relationship between matrix game and linear programming
- on the one hand, any matrix game can be brought into a pair of linear programming reports that can be compatible with each other, on the one hand, on the contrary, bring a linear programming report with any solution to a special type matrix game
Thus, the theory of linear programming is matrix

When creating extended matrices for reports (4) and (7) (8), you can make sure that the transposition of one matrix results in another
Linear programming reports (3) (4) and (7) (8) are mutually exclusive
In practice, it is often found to bring the game theory report to the mutually exclusive calculation of linear programming, than to bring the mutual accounting of linear programming to the calculation of game theory
Consider the following example of a marketing report solution using the game theory tool as an illustration

When distributing the training burden on the demand of the credit training system, the teacher provides three different subjects for 4 specialties and benefits from the request of the specialty
Each specialty is represented
adds items to the table (win matrix) with an estimate as needed
Table item describes the benefit in choosing the i-th discipline of the j-th specialty
With any demand, it is necessary to determine the effective proportion of the discipline implemented, which will have a guaranteed average profit gain
Conclusion
Before the release of the report, you can reduce the game matrix without recording inappropriate or duplicate strategies by analyzing the winning matrix
Since player B's goal is to reduce player A's gain, the second strategy (second column of the matrix) is unfavorable for player B compared to the first strategy (elements of the second column are larger than elements of the first column)
Therefore, you can leave the second column unrecorded
we get:

The solution of the system of given differential equations satisfying the initial conditions in the report is obtained using the ode45 solver using the fourth-order Runge- Kutt method
Matlab has solvers other than ode45 solver [4]
Choose a solver that solves a system of differential equations based on their properties, does not have the ability to obtain an accurate result or has to spend a lot of time
Methods for solving simple differential equations
When issuing different calculations, you can choose different procedures for the quantitative solution of simple differential equations
For example, the above example uses the ode45 function
Matlabe has the following functions:
- ode45 - Runge - based on the actual Kutt method: this is one step-by-step algorithm
at one of the previous points for output
know the value (tn 1)
are effective for primary solutions in the environment
ode23 is also a homogeneous method based on the specific Runge Kutta method, but less consistent, therefore effective for solutions with low accuracy and less rigor
The ode113- function uses the variable sequential Adams-Besfort-Milton method
It is more efficient than the ode45 method, that is, a polynomial that can be used if you need a special high accuracy and complex calculation of the right side of the equation
Therefore, before starting a report solution, you need to know the solutions at the first few points
To solve the system of strict equations, the Matlab system provides four functions:
ode15s - a method of inverse numerical differentiation, which, like the Gir method, is known as the ode113 method, is a polynomial
ode23s - uses the secondary Rosenbroke method
This will be more effective for precision cases than the ode15s method
ode23t - implementation of trapezoid rules with empty multiplier
Using this method makes sense if the report is not too complex and you do not need to digitally dampen the report
ode23th - implements a two-level solution according to the odd Runge-Kutt formula
The ode23s method is effective when this method does not require high solution accuracy
Accuracy or error of calculations affect the quality of the obtained solution
You can use the options option to set the accuracy of the ode45 ode23 ode15s ode23s ode23t solver.
It needs to be built with the function of Odessa
object of the type of observation
To reduce the relative error of calculations, you must generate the options parameter using Odessa and be the fourth additional argument of options solver
Relative error
The "RedTol" argument is used to show, and the "AbsTol" argument is used for absolute errors.
For example:
The solver invitation is recorded as follows:
For a complete list of possible parameters, see Matlab Help
Example of any function (procedure) in Matlab FUN1 not only with a simple message
The special procedure may be carried out through feval:
where the FUN1 function name is located on the apostrophe of one of the incoming text variables
The feature of calling a function in the second form is that the call does not lose its form when changing the name of the function, for example FUN2
You can unify contacts to all functions of a particular type with the same number of incoming and outgoing parameters
Here, the function name can be changed with any and all recourse
Because when you call a function using the feval procedure, the function name is treated as an incoming parameter of the procedure
This function can be used as a variable and framed as a reference to an M-file without knowing the specific name of the function
Calculating a Specific Integral

With a constant step, the number of regions n here the trapezoid formula is as follows:
this formula is executed by the program trapz (xy) in the Matlab center
And if you replace the function under the integral with a parabola, then with a constant step of integration, the Simpson formula approaches the following type:
this Simpson formula is executed using the quad program in Matlab
If the function is passed under the integral @ descriptory, it is a file -

First, we organize the calculation of the value of a certain integral using the trapezoid method as follows:
Now let's look at the Simpson calculation of the value of a certain integral:
The exact value of the envisaged integral is 0785398163
The results, as we see from the example, are accurate, and the calculations themselves are simple
With the correct choice of methods used for the above differential equations, you can get an accurate solution to a given report and notice the time economy

Construction calculations are derived by the algebraic method of intersection by the transformation method and other methods
Construction reports explained
Apollonius report concerns mathematicians
In general, a figure burning with three figures is called Apollonius report
The article provided for three circles of burning circles and two circles and a circle relating to direct
Nodal words: geometric location of the points of calculation of the construction, a circle burning in three circles, a circle burning in two circles and an Apollonius circle
The article we propose deals with geometric constructions and methods for solving them.
Geometric constructions were the focus of ancient Greek mathematicians of the VI-V centuries BC
All the great mathematicians of that time were engaged in geometric constructions
In particular, Pythagoras (b
d. 350-250 years) Archimedes Apollonius (b
d III century) Papp (III century AD) and other mathematicians
The following classical calculations of the 5th century BC are known:
wheel quadrature - square, the area of which is equal to the area of the specified wheel
doubling the cube - building a cube twice the volume of a given cube
three-section angle report (trisection) - between specified angles
divide into three equal parts
It has been proven that these reports cannot be solved using drawings and circuli, but these reports are still one of the main studies of many mathematicians
Built by ancient Greek mathematicians only with the help of linear and circulating figures and other building instruments prescribed by real geometric inserts (for example, transportation angular linear t
) is not included in the bookmark facility circuit
This tradition still continues in geometric constructions
In this case, only the ruler and compass are used as the overlay device
Ruler-scale is accepted as a single-lens ruler without a unit of ideal
Using such a ruler, it is allowed to lay only a beam with a transmitted head and one point or two ends of a given cut or a straight line passing through two given points
With the help of a compass, it is allowed to transfer a given cut along the formation (radiation) and lay a circle whose center is at a given point, and whose radius is equal to the given cut
A set of any points is called a shape
Circle with transverse interval with double radiation points round t
examples of these figures
The construction of a shape according to specified shapes and satisfying any conditions and methods for solving such calculations constitute a section of geometry called structural geometry
The culture of accounting for construction is that a figure written briefly with the mathematical designations of the chain of correct use of building instruments meets the conditions of distinct accounting
When compiling complex reports, you need a lot of perseverance and perseverance in leading it to previously released calculations of simple investments
In general, the content of the construction calculation solution in the plane is as follows:
- construction of a figure satisfying any conditions according to the presented figures;
Determination of how many solutions he has if he has a construction accounting solution;
Answer the question of whether the calculation of an attachment can be included in any report contract or whether it is necessary to impose certain restrictions on the shapes in the report submission when allowing the calculation of an attachment?
If answers are given to these three questions, then we can say that the calculation of construction is completely resolved
Before making calculations of capital construction, you should focus on the simplest investments that do not require careful analysis and argumentation and easily solved staged calculations, and make these investments so that these simple investments are trained by investing the source and trained by applying hands

Geometric location of points
A geometric shape can be transmitted in various ways, such as intersecting or merging any shapes or as a concept of a particular property
A set of all points with one or more common properties is called a short NGO geometric location of points
From this definition, it follows that the geometric location of the points in question has no properties other than this property.
Here are examples of simple NGOs:
a middle perpendicular of the NGO-left slice located at an equal distance from the slice ends (scheme 2);

Apollonium Circle
It is necessary to find an NGO whose distance ratio to given points A and B is equal to the number of given positive 𝜆 (𝜆 ≠ − 1)
In the given structure of AB, there are two points related to the desired NGO, one of which separates the slice of AB from the inside in relation to?, and the other separates the slice of AB in absentia in relation to?:
So that point F is any point of the desired NGO, that is,
Connect point F of the plane to points get triangle
It
in triangle (1) and (3) the ratio:
The formula shows that in a triangle, 𝐴𝐹𝐵 point E divides the opposite wall in proportion to the adjacent walls of the triangle, that is, the bisexecrix of the vertex F of the AFB triangle of the FE section
From relationships (2) and (3):
the formula means that the line 𝐹𝐷 is a bisector of the outer angle at the apex of the 𝐴𝐹𝐵 triangle 𝐹
If you consider that the internal and external bisexes of the angle F are perpendicular to each other, then any desired NGO
Note that the point refers to a circle with a diameter of
For any 𝐸𝐷 point of the circle with diameter 𝐹 (diagram 6)
If point = F coincides with points E and D on line AV
Therefore, in this case, the points E and D are distributed internally and externally with respect to the kesіndіsіn𝜆 AB
Let the point 𝐹 have any point of the desired NGO, except for points E and 𝐷
and, point with points ()
getting triangles
These triangles are similar: ∆𝐵𝐸𝐶 ∼ ∆𝐴𝐸𝐹
Due to the similarity of these triangles
from here
BKD	and	AFD	triangles	similarly: ∆ 𝐴𝐹𝐷 ∼ ∆𝐵𝐾𝐷	It	from the similarity of triangles
from here
𝐴𝐹⁄𝐵𝐶 = 𝐴𝐹⁄𝐵𝐾 further 𝐵𝐶 = 𝐵𝐾
In triangle 𝐶𝐹𝐾 𝐵𝐹-mediana and angle 𝐶𝐹𝐾 direct cause < 𝐶𝐹𝐾 = < 𝐸𝐹𝐷 and
Angle 𝐸𝐹𝐷 rests against diameter 𝐸𝐷
So, a circle with a geometric location and a cut diameter of points, the ratio of their distances to given points A and B of which is equal to the number of given (0 1), where point E in the cut ratio AB from the inside, and a point in relation to the cut AB highlights outside
This circle is called the circle of Apollonius
Show how the Apollonius circle is constructed when the number of two 𝜆 and 𝑝 is set as the cut ratio 𝑞
First, 𝜆 slice AB = 𝑝: 𝑞 and 𝐸 points that highlight the internal and external relationship to the 𝐷
Construction progress:
𝐴𝐵 = slice 𝑎 (circuit 7);
Rays of any 𝐴𝑅;

Points 𝐸 and 𝐷 highlight the slice AB from inside and outside: 𝑝 in relation to 𝑞

circle W (𝑂 𝑂𝐸);
So, circle Sh (𝑂 𝑂𝐸) on scheme 7 - circle Apollonius with a search
Apollonium Report
You must build a fourth circle that burns three specified circles
Apollonius said that he released this report, but the path to the conclusion of this report did not reach us
In the modern era of Apollonius, there were no inversion transformations, which mainly solved the calculation of Apollonius using the inversion method.
The thought of how Apollonius solved the report worries mathematicians
The goal of mathematicians is to restore the solution of Apollonius
This problem has not yet been fully resolved
We limit ourselves to a brief solution in this article, limited to report drawings
Three circles (painted with cocoon) are given in diagram 8
It is necessary to build a circle that burns down this framework
If you enter common internally strikethrough supports 12 and 23 and 31 circles, their intersection points define ABC triangle
A searched circle burning three circles defined by an internally erased circle in the ABC triangle
Also, the bisectors of the ABC triangle put on the given frames at points A "V'S"
A searched circle burning three circles set in this triangle A'V "S"
In the next article, consider the various versions of this report and build an exquisite figure using different methods

The article reflects the shortcomings of the newly adopted primary school based on the analysis of the mathematical program: the program prioritizes general pedagogical issues of organizing the educational system; Features of mathematics teaching are outlined; in primary school
the content of the subject "Mathematics" is not disclosed; It is difficult to discern the purpose of training in the "Training Goals System" or methodological recommendations or exercises; "Long-term plan" does not comply with didactics and methodological rules
Content of the subject "Mathematics" - long-term plan
It is also natural that the economy of science and technology makes changes in the content of education and the system of education, worthy of the pace of development.
The content of social and humanitarian disciplines in the school undergoes more frequent changes due to the political and cultural economic conditions taking place in the country, the content of natural and mathematical disciplines cannot be greatly changed
The content of natural and mathematical disciplines in our country mainly corresponds to educational programs in countries of the world
Of course, there may be slight deviations from the curricula of some countries
It is necessary to carefully make changes in the content of natural and mathematical disciplines
Active campaign to update secondary education content is under way
It, of course, began from the beginning
What are the shortcomings of the primary school curricula that are still in school?
What is the advantage of the new program, why there was no substantiated evidence that this program is being introduced into the school
Are the training programmes being implemented new?
Leaving an opinion on the content of other educational disciplines within the competence of specialists in this field, I express my vision of the program of mathematics, one of the main disciplines in primary education
From the structure of the "updated" program, it can be seen that the primary school preferred the general pedagogical issues of organizing the educational system than the definition of the content of the subject "Mathematics" [1]
But including the formation of mathematical concepts in the teaching of mathematics at the head, the possession of rules and laws, the selection of a package of exercises and tasks for teaching to compile a report
Nothing is said about daily work in lessons
The program does not disclose the content of the subject "Mathematics" in elementary school
The content of mathematical disciplines of all primary schools is presented in the form of quarterly tables
If he reveals the schedule, then he can accommodate all school mathematics courses
At the beginning of the new program, there is training material for departments and departments within departments
But it is unclear what topics and concepts will be included in the units
When creating pre-school and secondary school programs, it is impossible to be guided by this new program, since a complete list of materials trained at the head is not provided! Primary school will certainly be difficult for authors of math textbooks
in the section "Numbers and Criteria" "Training Content" in Program 1
1 Natural and rational numbers "consists of two complex chapters of the digital system, which are themselves called" Natural Number "and" Rational Number "
Numbering of concepts (natural numbers) containing the heading "natural number," arithmetic actions applied to natural numbers, comparative simplicity and a combined number with signs of divisibility of the sum of a prime number and the multiplier of a natural number
) it is not indicated which are provided in the head
Therefore, it is doubtful that by the goals of teaching for classes, the program allows you to determine the goals of teaching for the formation of knowledge and skills, and the teacher - to plan his work and evaluate the achievements of students [1 12 b]
As you know, the content of the topic "Rational numbers" is even more complicated
The updated programme provides for the application of the term "natural number" in different units
Does not take into account (does not know) that the primary school education of the creators of the program is created on a concentrated basis with the wording "Natural numbers and the actions applied to them"
Division "1, because the updated program plans to add and reduce parts with the same sections" simple fraction "
1 Natural and rational numbers "
With the inclusion of elements of fractional numbers in the training program, he cannot fully determine the size of the concept of "rational numbers"
On such cases "Algebraic expressions and transformations"
Equations and Inequalities t
and about its units
It is not known which concepts these topics will also be addressed in the title
In general, elements of algebra and geometry will be studied on the basis, and not Algebra Geometry
Novelty of the updated program "Mathematics"
Mathematical Modeling and Its Section 4
1 Mathematical language and mathematical model "
In the traditional program "Mathematics" there is also the concept of "Mathematical modeling," which is not entirely clear, as well as the content of training.
the importance of mathematical knowledge is not disclosed, without which it is impossible to master knowledge
Mathematical model in school cannot be considered separately from mathematical knowledge
In the process of teaching mathematics, for example, real mathematical models (cubic parallelepiped ball
models) and mathematical models (mathematical symbols and symbols of the graph formula t
) is widely used both as an educational tool and as an object of training
Mathematical Calculation and Model
There is no large boundary between the mathematical language and the mathematical model
It does not surprise us that we introduce the topic "Mathematical Model" into school.
This is not news for us
The creators of this program want to show another great achievement - the "Educational Goals System"
Each teacher plans such goals for each lesson
Reading the same "System of educational goals," including those who do not agree with "literature," cannot distinguish between the purpose of training or the totality of recommendations and exercises
There is no continuity that arises from each other as the location of educational goals by class
It is not known how the "Training Goals System" was defined due to the fact that the "Training Content" in the program is not specified exactly
"A distinguishing feature from a traditional program" is what is done for advertising
The proposed primary school program "Mathematics" cannot be a subject program either does not belong to a methodological tool, or is a package of proposals for a teacher
The Program will create a "Long Term Plan" based on the "Training Goals System" (our annual plan)
It is divided into quarters
But it, like ours, does not reflect the topics that take place every quarter, and the number of hours allocated to these topics
Target chain placed in place of it by department
it is brought
In the annual plan, drawn up in accordance with the traditional mathematical program, each topic of mathematics is compiled in such a way that learning at the origins is carried out concentrically (or spiral, as the propagandists of this program themselves say), maintaining the consistency and continuity that arise one after another.
The "long-term plan" drawn up under the "updated" program is a restructuring of the "Training Goals System" itself in a different order
Program created for class 1 Long Term Plan only
It turns out that the implemented program has not yet been completed!
I quarter of the "Long-term plan" "About myself" "My school" "My family and friends" is divided into "Common topics" "The world around us"
Other neighborhoods are the same
For each of them, there is nothing in common in a suitable mathematical program
Does not display the target system's relationship to these common topics
I think that when implementing the goals of education in accordance with the general theme, it is necessary to pay attention to such educational issues so that educational work should be carried out comprehensively.
Mathematics has the opportunity to effectively conduct such educational issues simultaneously with education
The introduction of such "Common Themes" into the "long-term" plan means the amount of artificial survival that we would like to show above our annual plans
Otherwise, there is nothing in the program about students' mastery of math knowledge and skills
And the possibilities of education in the process of teaching mathematics are not revealed
I have set learning goals according to the I II Q1 codes
Then the first classes of the 1st quarter begin with familiarization with geometric figures (5 goals in a row: 1)
If even in the first lessons that opened the doors of the school, it were possible to bring an idea of ​ ​ all the geometric figures studied throughout the school course to such an extent that they were recognizable, then the entire school system would be a great success.
But 1
It is not clear why goal 2 is set a second time after one
"Sixth target after this" 1
1 Classification of fees by their characteristics (volume of horse color shape) "
Is it not intended to familiarize students with the concept of "classification": "set" "set elements"?
If you want to say that a student who has not yet learned to count the same thing on the 1st grade desk writes down the numbers and does not know how to recognize them, not knowing what a "numerical structure" is 1
1, Distinguish digits and numbers distinguish the same numbers in various ways (sticks with a set of points and t
) indicate along the numeric line "replace with" 1
Using sum and difference numbers to map numeric series in numeric intervals of neighboring numbers "?
1 Knowledge of the way of constructing and the composition of the number, in which there is an idea of ​ ​ the natural number and 0 "As a goal" to read the numbers up to 10 "reference to three different programs" 1
Natural and rational numbers "" 1
Mutual arrangement of geometric shapes "" 1
Do you want to follow the steps in numbers? And Why This Goal "1
Direct and inverse calculus of numbers up to 10 should precede the achievement of the goal of determining their ordinal number in a series of natural numbers "? How can one be able to understand the "natural number" if they are already accustomed to "reading numbers up to 10"? How to understand this if before that there was no data on 0?
After completing the task "Building a addition table and applying the corresponding conditions for reducing the same numbers," it should be understood that the goal "Merging a group of connective substances and understanding the method of reduction in the form of movement from left to right and right in the numerical structure as a shift from right to left" was formulated by people who teach children at school.
This "Long Term Plan" does not comply with any principles of didactics and methodology of sciences
We can say that negativity is enough
There is surprise how they decided to conduct an experiment with such a program in one boiling water
Will it hurt our children?
The authors say that this is a long-term plan, on the basis of which a medium-term plan will be developed, which will take into account all
Primary school had no opportunity to familiarize itself with the "middle" and "short-term" plans
But it operates in Intellectual Schools
read the "medium-term" plan
For primary education
you wish that the models of "middle" and "short-term" plans are not the same as in these Intellectual Schools
I doubt the readiness of the medium-term plan than the full completion of the "long-term" plan in the Programme
Critical reviews of new standards and standard versions of elementary school programs are not mentioned in the press
As a result of familiarization with the approved "new" program, it is clear that the authors are "not alarmed"
In the first section of the program "Importance of the subject" Mathematics, "questions about the place and significance of primary school as an educational subject of mathematics were not clear
The share of mathematics in primary education is not disclosed
It is difficult to understand what is said in the text
For example, analysis is one way to think
The second sentence of the third paragraph on page 4 reads: "Mathematical considerations and the rules for their construction help students develop the skills to use algorithms and build new algorithms with the ability to prove their opinion."
This, of course, is the "innovation" of the program!
The section contains erroneous or difficult to understand phrases and sentences:
"Mathematics uses a universal sign language and is an effective tool for recognizing and explaining phenomena in the environment"
"The use of mathematical terminology will allow students to develop a short and informational language"	creates a desire for sustainable development and improvement "
In the second part of the Programme, entitled "Objective of the curriculum in Mathematics," the authors pay particular attention to the difference between the objectives of the "programme" and the objectives of the curriculum
"Dedicated responsibility for knowledge of the Program creates conditions for the development of personal qualities, such as confidence and independence"
What conditions does the program create? A subject written according to the program can create textbook conditions
In the article "Supporting the development of language skills of students in accordance with the trilingual policy" of the program "Pedagogical methods and approaches used in the teaching of the subject" Mathematics "" Teachers of disciplines to support the teaching of subject content pay attention to students' mastery of the scientific language in relation to the subject "[1 8b
And how can he speak the scientific language only to support the teaching of the content of the subject?
Mathematical knowledge consists of considerations characterizing the properties and characteristics of concepts
And if they are available, the corresponding terms denote the symbols of the form t
expressed by mathematical language elements
Knowledge of mathematical knowledge cannot differ from knowledge of mathematical language
Therefore, "teacher defines language goals for each lesson" - this is an excess load for teachers
"Teachers of disciplines should pay attention to the use of the scientific language by students and support the assessment of their linguistic achievements"
A math teacher must constantly monitor the ability of students to correctly speak the language of science - mathematical
But making a student's language achievements without any support other than assessing mathematical knowledge.
He does not agree that "in order to develop substantive content and use of language, students need to systematically and organized provide them with the necessary phrases for dialogue and subscription"
Mathematical
the fruit of "creativity" of a person who has not studied degenmatic "must be provided with the necessary phrases" specifically, except for knowledge
In the process of teaching mathematics, "here we have received mathematical education" will not "teach mathematical language" or use it
Somehow, psychologists showed the similarity between teaching students a mathematical language and teaching a foreign language
It has been proved that performing work on writing a mathematical opinion (sentence) in the language of a logical-mathematical symbol and vice versa is an effective way of mastering mathematical knowledge and mathematical language
This work takes place in every lesson.
The six, entitled "Building a Sense of Respect for Diversity of Cultures and Views," in the curriculum on the subject of Mathematics, contain: "Two of the three parts that are set out in the fifth part basically repeat it.
"ICT Competency" includes more ICT skills and skills than specific ICT applications in primary school math
For example, "teaching students to use basic technologies" does not apply to the tasks of mathematics "developing self-work skills related to the search and choice of information"
Not an object of ICT training for the subject of mathematics - this is a means of its application
How to use ICT to improve mathematics in the learning process, not said
"Self-construction of plan and graphics" "Creating presentation slides" "Creating a video reflection about the process of performing a mathematical task (creating geometric shapes)" is not used to assist in mastering mathematical material, but to reflect the completed case
Currently, instead of delving into the possibility of using ICT to deliver educational materials to students, primary school students are studying mathematics, the program says
Learning Information Retrieval and Management "
"e.g. multiplication graph
as with knows
In the eighth section "Development of communication skills of students"
educating citizens who can find a language in accordance with various social communities "in order to achieve the goal" it is necessary to create a stimulating and supportive environment "
What kind of environment was he? What happens to classmates not getting into this environment?
If he is punished, he will give black
Is it possible that "as part of an educational program to develop communication skills, students enter into oral and written relations with teachers and the public with classmates through the media and other communication means"?
"Mathematics" competently uses the scientific language "
And if you say "literate language of mathematics," will a student be able to competently use it on his own? A student has to purposefully study the mathematical language so that he competently applies the language of science - the mathematical language.
If you understand that listening is the ability to listen	"Math	in training	pupils	hearing	and	Examples of work that contributes to the development of speech skills: "how to teach" listening "actions and no work that contributes to its development
do not see the template
And if you understand that to say "speak" is to be able to speak, then when studying the subject of mathematics, you can correctly formulate rules and laws, describing the content of a text report, read mathematical expressions
would have been so
But none of them is in question
Depending on the language of mathematical speech, as among examples of works that contribute to the development of students' recording skills in the process of teaching mathematics
"description and interpretation of methods of oral and written decision of mathematical reports"
In the ninth section of the Program "Methods for evaluating the results of training in the subject" Mathematics, "the result of the assessment in the subject" Mathematics "is carried out by means of a criterion assessment."
Definition of "Benchmark Evaluation"
The concept defined in the "help" is defined by the concept itself
True tautology
Characteristics of the defined concept are not specified
"The benchmark assessment must be clearly defined"
What do we mean by "clearly defined"? If we say that a clearly defined one should correspond to the goals and content of primary education, it can be assumed that this was "criteria consistent with the goals and content of education."
The program also lacks training content
The content of Formative (Current) and Internal Summary Assessment is no different from our traditional day-to-day and thematic controls
Then nothing new will be added, excluding the entire elementary school program for renaming types of control
Cannot justify the implementation of a program called "updated"

The result was obtained within the class of theory about the fragment of the nuclear existence of the model and its connection with the center and characterizing the types of comfort and atomic model
The properties of fragments of various components of existential simple convex yonson theory are considered.
It is proved that the concepts of completeness and model completeness are equivalent for subclasses of all classes of ionic theories

Model-theoretical questions related to setting various reports on this concept in given classes of new theory [7 b
64-69] is a study for previously reviewed theories
Basic information of the Johnson theory and presentation of a report on this concept can be read [7]
In this regard, yonson theory as a whole refers to incomplete theory, and judging by the complete theory, the research apparatus is not very developed
On the one hand, there are a lot of examples of Yonson theories: the description fields fixed in the group of able groups have various types of Boolean algebra and polygons - examples of universal algebra (in the English environment they denote the monoid S, called S-acts)
Therefore, the search for methods and new approaches to teaching incomplete theories is a pressing issue
and the development of the research apparatus, obtaining new fashion-theoretical results in the structure of this model plays an important role in the development in our case of incomplete theories of model theory
We strive to work with more complete theories for certain types of sentences stating incomplete Yonson theories, since we apply the semantic method in the study of the properties of the theory of the first sequence, the essence of which is to translate the elementary properties of the center of the Yonson theory into this theory.
This works well in all types of studies, that is, it does not concern "insignificant" studies, but the course of the study is associated with the concept of the dimension of the model
The study of such issues has begun and its conclusions [4b
In this article, we study the model-theoretical properties of companions of the new classes of the theory under consideration.

An article with various components for yonsonic theories is provided in the writings of one of the authors
At the same time, in the semantic model of new classes, theories are considered in the study of the closeness of the internal set of yonsons and are different components
In this article, we consider the analogue of the result for classes of the internal set of yonsonic theory expressed using yonsonic sets

We say that ∀∃-saldarlary any theory in this theory constitutes a fragment of yonson, if in the deductive closure of this ∀∃-saldarynyң there is a theory of yonson
In this case, the resulting yonson theory is called a yonson fragment (hereinafter referred to as a fragment) in the corresponding yonson set
The day before, we determined the yonson fees [3 s
In this regard, in this work we reduce the class of yonsonic theories, but we can consider the class of yonsonic theories in general conditions using yonsonic sets, since these charges are only an internal set of the semantic model, and not a model of the theory under consideration.

Results of investigation of flow structure formed between electrodes of electrodynamic plasma accelerator in operation are given.
Quantitative modeling using two-component block model was carried out for coaxal plasma accelerator structure
Specifies the dependence of the flow structure on the plasma density indicated by the initial operating pressure
The resulting information is compared with experimental results
Plasma focus of dense plasma flow Rogovsky belt
Introduction
Plasma flows formed on super-powerful pulsed accelerators are widely used in physical and technological installations
Although the installation scheme is not complex, the dynamics of plasma formation on the channel depends on the experimental conditions and the geometry of the electrode system.
Therefore, the experimental study of the formed plasma flow should be carried out separately with respect to each accelerator
A complete study of pulsed plasma accelerators, as indicated in [12], showed that when the current value "critical" Jkr was reached in these accelerators, a sharp increase in discharge voltage and a change in the VAS of the accelerator was observed
Also, oscillations with a large amplitude fluctuated in the accelerator
This result is associated with the effect of the Hall effect on the horizontal magnetic field, that is, when a longitudinal component of the electric field occurs, the discharge structure changes
Based on Morozov's analysis of plasma acceleration in the magnetic field, Hall showed that the effect is observed only with a high gas density, that is, when fulfilling the quasi-neutral plasma condition [3]
Subsequent experiments carried out in SCR accelerators [4] The effect of the hall indicates that the plasma is compressed towards one electrode and contributes to the output of current from the electrodes
In this regard, it is of great interest to study the operation of plasma accelerators in a fully filled mode
Working chamber in fully filled mode is filled with gas at specified pressure
This will make it possible to widely transform the plasma formation density
In this mode, ion-plasma flows of a certain structure can be obtained and this contributes to the technical and technological promising use of plasma accelerators [5-8]
This paper provides diagnostics of plasma flow developed in pulse plasma accelerator at different values of initial pressure and discharge voltage
Experimental installation
It is used to test advanced diagnostic methods and modify the metal surfaces of the coaxial accelerator KPҮ-30 manufactured at ETFGZI
Electrodes of a copper installation with a cylindrical length of 45 cm with a diameter of an external electrode - 9 cm, and a diameter of an internal electrode - 3 cm
Unlike the standard "coaxial," the length of the center electrode and the length of the outer electrode are about 5 cm shorter than the inner electrode of the outer electrode and have a buffer volume on the heads of the electrodes
Of 25 capacitors (IK-50-3) with total capacity of 75 μF with operating voltage of 30 kV of storage system
Air is removed as working gas after the chamber is pumped to working pressure
During the study, the Rogovsky belt was used with a ring with a different number of rings and located outside the discharge bus or located in the inner plane of the accelerator perpendicular to the direction of the plasma bus
Thus, inside the accelerator, the current passing through the section of the ring is measured
If the belt is located outside, the value of the current in it is equal to the value of the discharge current of the capacitors, and when located, the current in the plasma
The scheme of the experiment is shown in Figure 1
Oscilloscope C8-14 is used for recording of belt signals and supplied to oscilloscope income without signal amplifier through coaxial cable 50 ohms
Oscillograms of signals are obtained by photographing the oscilloscope screen

Digital Modeling
Consider the motion of a two-component quasi-neutral plasma consisting of electron and ion blocks with crossed electric and magnetic fields
Blocks are displaced relative to each other due to different masses and charges of electrons and ions
Then longitudinal component of electric field is formed [9]
The centers of gravity of the ionic and electronic units, as well as the equations characterizing the movements of the x-component of the electric field directed along the axis of the electrode system, are as follows:
The numerical solution of linear equations is calculated in system 7 MathCAD according to the following initial conditions: discharge strength of 20 kV of magnetic field 2 the initial velocity of particles Tl is zero
Magnetic field value and other parameters for KPҮ-30 are found using zone methods [1011]
The dependence of the trajectory of particles on the concentration of n corresponding to the working pressure at the electron temperature of 50 eV was studied
Figures 2 a and a show the center of gravity of the blocks at very low plasma density n 0 i.e. at non-quasi-neutrality
Considering electric space at low density (width 2 cm
length 45 cm
) ions in vertical direction, and electrons in horizontal direction move independently from each other
drawing
At low density a) ion trajectory and a) electron trajectory (a)
When quasi-neutrality is performed, that is, at a large number of concentrations, our picture changes
Figure 3a shows the trajectory of electrons at different concentrations
If the concentration is less than 1012, the electron moves along the cycloid along the x axis
The higher the concentration, the more the electron moves in the remote direction, and the movement of ions in this direction is difficult due to the influence of the electric field (Figure 3a)
Electrons with current between electrodes in this way	provokes		ions	system	"clean	inertial "		originator	is [12]
This leads to the acceleration of ions of the longitudinal (x) electric field, the so-called "holly," arising in the electric space
This happens as follows: first, electrons with a low speed of ions are ahead of them
During the period of reverse braking, the electrons retreat and pull the ions back
Electrons and ions	the average speed of drifts moving along it is obvious in any density value
As a result, the accelerator	stop	big	amplitude		longitudinal	fluctuations	to be observed		has to
As is known, the period of these oscillations is determined by the amplitude of the external electric field

Concentration 1011-1012 cm -
If you exceed 3, consider the related field
Results of the experiment
Experimental studies were conducted to determine the dynamics of intracellular flow formation
Internal belt current value is detected depending on initial discharge voltage 005 008 01 05 and pressure 1 Torr
Discharge voltage is changed in steps of 2 kV from 12 to 24 kV
Typical oscillograms at 12 kV are given in Figure 4
All images show negative and positive maxima distributed over time
Since the intermediate displacement of vertices with equal polarity is comparable to the period of the external discharge current, it can be said that in each discharge period two vertices with polarity of opposite ones are formed
Analysis of the dependence of signals on the initial operating pressure made it possible to establish new patterns of plasma flow formation
With less pressure, the amplitude of the negative vertices is greater than the positive ones (Figure 4a)
As the pressure increases, the amplitudes of the positive vertices increase and at a pressure of 1 Torr have the same vertices (4a-
figure)
A similar situation is observed when the discharge increases the voltage at constant pressure, but the display is not clear

Plasma current oscillogram obtained at different pressures (a)
In addition, belt measurements were carried out, for which the belt was placed inside the accelerator at different distances along the length from the electrodes
In this case, the flow structure remains unchanged and the type and amplitude of the signals varies depending on the distance
Figure 5 shows the first positive (I +) and negative (I-) amplitude of the vertices in the graph calculated from the beginning of implementation
Note that the amplitudes of positive vertices, as seen in the picture, changed smoothly, not counting the insignificant maximum in the region of 10 cm
At the same time, we clearly see a maximum of 8 cm from the negative external electrodes
The increase in current amplitude at some intervals is not evidence that here the volume of charges increases, since the area between the vertices gradually decreases
This is largely due to the deionization of plasma from a collision with a neutral gas
that is, comes from the dissipation of energy
For objective reasons, when removed from the electrodes, the number of charged parts decreases
Given this problem, the amplitude of the current along the length of the accelerator should gradually fall
This process is well expressed in ion current (Figure 5)
drawing
Plasma Current versus Distance
But for an electronic current of 6 and 8 cm, the amplitude of the signal increases sharply
The decrease in width and the simultaneous increase in its amplitude in one place or another indicate the grouping of particles along the axis of the system in place
This phenomenon can be associated with the formation of electromagnetic focus at a certain distance after the electrodes
In this case, the current line exits the electrodes and is compressed along the axis of the system
A similar situation should be observed on ions, but the focus effect for them is not observed due to their large mass
The results obtained during the experiment can be explained as follows: at low operating pressure, electrons move at a drifting speed proportional to E/H to the end of the electrodes
At this time, ions accelerate in the horizontal direction due to the large larmor radius and quickly reach the electrode walls until the electrons leave the electric space
Therefore, only negative vertices associated with electrons are recorded in oscillograms
When pressure increases, ions accelerate longitudinally behind electrons and have a longitudinal plasma oscillation in the accelerator channel
The dynamics of these oscillations are determined by the external electric field, that is, the voltage in the electrodes
Therefore, oscillograms observe positive and negative vertices associated with longitudinal fluctuations
Conclusion
Thus, the spatial structure of the plasma flow depends on the density of the gas in the accelerator channel
At low density (concentration less than 1011 cm-3), the plasma consists of almost electronic current component
This corresponds to the operating pressure of the source air 005 Torr
At high operating pressure (01 Torr), the gearbox accelerates in the idle mode and the plasma structure consists of sequentially excited electronic and ion components
But with a complete cycle of oscillations, the plasma of the neutral
The generated plasma focus range is also determined

The peculiarities of the formation of the detected flow can be used to assemble sources of charged particles of low energy
In addition, these effects can be used in the processing of electron ion materials in the production technology of the material.

Electrical oscillations studied comprehensively in theoretical and experimental terms
However, digital methods or computer experiments implemented by electronic computing machines in the study of vibration data are still underutilized

The main goal of the computer experiment
in order to obtain general information on the form of the study with limited possibilities (creation of a specific device or absence of such an opportunity to conduct an experiment)
Below are several computer experiments to investigate electrical vibrations using Mathcad
Analyzing Electromagnetic Free Oscillations with Mathcad Application Software
Harmonic oscillator
Consider the closed circuit of capacitor C with inductance L of coil and resistor with resistance R (Figure 1)
Do not take into account coil resistance by capacitor plates and conductors
Such an electrical circuit is called a swinging circuit
Charge concentrated in capacitor at time q (t) is indicated by current i (t) in resistor and voltage coil in capacitor liners u (t)
Charge the capacitor positively, then the current direction will be the same as in Figure
Taking into account the fluctuations of the change in charge in the capacitor, we can write the following equations
Combining these equations, we get a new equation:
q (t) = considering equation Cu (t)
Figure 1
General Vibration Loop Type
Equation (1) is called a second order differential equation with constant coefficients [1-4]
This equation describes a time-dependent change in the amount of charge in a harmonic oscillator
Using the Mathcad application package, we conduct computer experiments (1) find graphical solutions to the equation [5]
computer experiment
When the resistor resistance in the loop is equal to zero (R = 0), the charge value in the capacitor changes harmonically (red line graph)
Figure 2)
Figure 2
Solutions to differential equation (1) in the case of P = 0 in the oscillatory circuit
The graph of the relationship between charge and current is called a phase portrait (diagram)
Phase portrait of harmonic oscillation has the shape of a circle or ellipse (plot with a blue line)

We get an electric oscillation that turns off the resistance of the resistor in the loop at not equal to zero (R0) (graph with red line)
Figure 3)
Phase portrait of oscillations has the shape of a spiral (plot with a blue line)
Figure 3
Solutions to differential equation (1) in the case of R0 oscillatory circuit
computer experiment
When resistor resistance in the loop is very high, no oscillation occurs, the system from inequality tends to equilibrium (graph with a red line)
Figure 4)
This phenomenon is similar to capacitor discharge through resistor
This phenomenon is called aperiod [6]
The phase portrait of this movement has a linear shape (plot with a blue line)
Figure 4
Solutions to differential equation (1) with very high resistor resistance in the swing loop
Computer experiments on unrefined electrical oscillations
Forced electrical oscillations
Due to slight obstacles to activation of the coil and conductors in the swing circuit, the free electric vibrations contained in it relate to swing oscillations
If a current source is included in the oscillating circuit, which has a periodic effect from the outside, then current and voltage can be obtained in the circuit, the amplitude of which constantly changes periodically
An involuntary electric oscillation that occurs in the circuit is called an alternating current
Electric power of current source, which has periodic effect from outside
(t) by law	if changes	the resulting variable	current	and the voltage is harmonious (Figure 5)
Figure 5
Electrical circuit with forced electric oscillations
This equation describes a time-dependent change in the amount of charge in the electrical circuit
computer experiment
Do not have the active resistance of the closed electrical circuit specified in Figure 5 (R = 0)
Do not have charge in capacitor (q = 0)
In this case, the amplitude of the charge oscillations in the capacitor (or the amplitude of the variable in the electric circuit) increases exactly in proportion to the time (Figure 6)
And the phase portrait, which characterizes the connection between the current in the circuit and the amount of charge in the capacitor, is helical and has constant distances between the spiral lines
Figure 6
Solutions of differential equation (2) with R = 0 in electrical circuit and q = 0 in capacitor liners
computer experiment
Do not have the active resistance of the closed electrical circuit specified in Figure 6 (R = 0), but in case of charging on the capacitor
In this case, the charge amplitude in the capacitor is about one period, that is, T=2 seconds (T=2√𝐿𝐶) of constant harmonic oscillation (see Phase portrait in the form of an ellipse in accordance with one period)
2 seconds after the start of oscillations, the charge amplitude increases directly in proportion to time and has a phase portrait spiral characterizing the connection between the current in the circuit and the amount of charge in the capacitor (Figure 7)
Figure 7
Solutions of differential equation (2) in electrical circuit R = 0 and in case of primary charges in capacitor liners
computer experiment
The resistance of the closed electric circuit and if the capacitor is not charged at the initial time, the amount of charge in the circuit (and the current in the circuit) begins to oscillate harmonically only after T=3 seconds
This situation can be seen in the phase portrait (Figure 8)
Figure 8
Solutions of differential equation (2) with active obstacle in electric circuit and presence of q = 0 in capacitor liners
computer experiment
The resistance of the closed electric circuit and if the capacitor is charged at the initial time, the amount of charge in the circuit (and the current in the circuit) begins to oscillate harmonically only after T=2 seconds
This situation can be seen in the phase portrait (Photo 9)
Figure 9
Solutions of differential equation (2) in the presence of active resistance in the electric circuit and primary charge in the capacitor liners
In the experiment shown in the 10 figures, conditions are provided under which the capacitor is charged by a large amount
Its initial charge is 25 times the amplitude of the harmonic charge installed in the circuit
In the phase portrait, it can be seen that it takes several periods to establish a harmonic oscillation in the circuit
Figure 10
Solutions of differential equation (2) in the presence of active resistance in the electric circuit and initial charge of the value in which the capacitor is submerged
When analyzing electrical oscillations, the computer experiment has the following advantages:
Practical work related to certain conditions when experimenting with the physical means necessary for the study of the oscillatory system may not include all factors
And during a computer experiment, using mathematical and computer models describing the physical form or phenomenon being studied, you can do research on any contract
Stopping or interrupting in a particular physical experiment is in most cases impossible
And during a computer experiment, you can take a break and analyze the results obtained up to this point
You can also repeat the computer experiment several times at your discretion

Introduction
Lower natural gas prices and a large number of meetings in the subsoil make it economically attractive in the energy sector
95-96% of natural gas consist of methane (Ch4) [1] and methane of carbon fuel
provides maximum specific heat of combustion (552 MW/kg) per unit mass
Gaseous fuel can be stored at very high pressure (20-25 MPa) in compressed state at low temperatures in liquefied state (-163 ° C) or at medium pressure (3-35 MPa) in adsorbed state
Application of gas storage technologies in liquefied state at temperature -163 ° C or at high pressure (20-25 MPa) in compressed state requires a lot of energy
And the storage of natural gas in the adsorbed state operates under pressure 6-7 times less than in the form of storage in the compressed state
It is also possible to use a two-stage single-stage compressor for filling cylinders.
This alternative mobile storage system reduces energy for gas compression or liquefaction, reducing compressor costs
Transfer of transport from liquid fuel (gasoline diesel) to natural gas will increase environmental safety
Adsorption reduces the amount of adsorption, increasing the temperature of the released thermal adsorbent when filling the cylinders with gas due to the endothermic process
And this will reduce the amount of stored gas
Therefore, when filling with gas, it is necessary to cool the adsorbent to increase the capacity of the cylinder
Mathematical model
The quantitative study used the properties of methane, which is the main component of natural gas
When filling (withdrawing) methane into an adsorption cylinder storing natural gas at medium pressure, the laws of conservation of mass pulse energy and the kinetic adsorption equation are used
The mass retention equation taking into account the gas flow generated by the adsorption/desorption of natural gas is expressed as follows:

The maximum gas velocity depending on the critical flow is determined by the formula:
where Qcharge- volume flow SIN - cross-sectional area of the gas pipeline entering the cylinder (pipe diameter is much larger than the diameter of the connecting pipeline) CN - constant Pcharge - incoming gas pressure CV - resistance coefficient of connecting pipes and Tcharge valve - inlet gas temperature

heat capacity of adsorbent T - temperature
H	- adsorption heat and to   b kg  (1  t) cc

To describe the kinetics of gas adsorption, a nerve model of linear motion force (LDF) is used:
where E is the energy characteristic of the adsorbed system

To calculate the equilibrium of the adsorption size, the Dubinin-Astakhov equation is used:
where and
- specific volume of adsorbed gas (methane) W0 - adsorption

parameter Ps - saturated gas pressure Pcr - critical gas pressure, Tcr - critical gas temperature
The adsorption temperature is determined as follows:
The inherent heat capacity in the adsorbed phase is then recorded as follows:
where cpg is specific heat capacity in gas phase [4]

Copper pipes for thermoregulator system are laid on the cylinder considered as specified in the pit (Figure 2)
Between heat exchange plates filled with adsorbent powder Maxsorb III
When gas is pumped into the cylinder, there is water for a stable temperature of copper pipes
During gas injection inside the change of average temperature value in circulation and circulation state of water is calculated
Temperature change of boundary-tube heat exchanger is obtained (Figure 4)
As can be seen from the result, the water in the pipeline cools the adsorption heat (Figure 5)
Therefore, the pressure in the cylinders decreases

Average temperature value in cylinders during circulation and circulation of water through copper heat exchange pipes limited by pressure mode plates
During circulating water injection, the temperature in the cylinders decreases
As a result, the absorption rate of the adsorbent, which controls the absorption and vent modes and uses the temperature range, is increased (Figure 6).
Therefore, in order to increase the efficiency of filling/ejecting gas into the transport cylinder, it is necessary to cool/heat the cylinders

Change of adsorption volume dimensions (kg/kg mass) during circulation and circulation of water through copper heat exchange pipelines for injection mode
The balloon thermoregulator increases the rate of mass pumping during injection or withdrawal of methane into the cylinders due to the boundary surface and pipeline
(Figure 7)
High mass transportation will reduce the filling time with transport gas
The calculation results show that when activated coal powders are used, the design of the cylinder does not affect the mass content of the gas, but reduces the adsorption margin with an increase in the temperature of the radial flow flowing from the filter pipe

Average mass flow rate in cylinders
Therefore, when pumping and removing gas to cylinders, a boundary-pipeline heat exchanger is most effective
The result of this work shows the efficiency of using a thermal control process that increases the volume amount of adsorption
That is, the filling time of the cylinder is reduced and the adsorbent temperature is gradually reduced, and the amount of adsorbed methane is increased.

Analysis of the study on the organization of training by teleconference has been carried out;
The features of teleconference in the school informatics training system are identified;
developed a methodology for organizing teleconference as a composition of ideas and conditions for teaching informatics at school [1]
The results of the study will improve the informatization of education by teleconference and create an educational environment for modeling the educational process at the school for the development of its scientific and theoretical foundations
The peculiarities of organizing the formation of students' information knowledge in subjects based on information and communication use, as well as methods of innovative pedagogical technologies are differentiated
The school tested the electronic resources of the training site using a teleconference to teach the subject of informatics
Results and results of research work can be used online teleconference related to formation of information knowledge of personality [2]
Teleconference is one of the active types of training in widely used and active telecommunications technologies
allows users to know many phenomena to form their own approach to what is happening and jointly solve questions and share their thoughts.
In recent years, teleconference has actually existed in school, but there is little theoretical and practical research that contributes to the learning process
A researcher in this industry is one of the famous American researchers A.
According to Bork, educational materials using other networks than regular e-mail are still not produced
With the advent of interesting pedagogical capabilities implemented through networks, they do not need to
Therefore, the network is an expensive addition with no impact on the learning process
Unfortunately, the methods of using telecommunications technologies in the educational process created by teachers did not become the subject of research by students of pedagogical universities
But at the same time, when a teacher begins his pedagogical activity, in addition to mastering work with new computer technologies, he should know new methods of using them in the process of learning [2]
Email is used to communicate with one or more people
What do you need to do to send a message to a group of people? To do this, use teleconferences (network conferences or forums)
The term teleconference is used as a synonym for the concept of "news set" due to its close connection with the language of remote exchange of information
Teleconference is direct or delayed
The user can choose a teleconference that wants to connect to the news server using a special program
As a result, you can record in the conference materials on the subject of the user: read and comment on texts, read messages from other users and participate in other news
The dynamic development of informatics and the growing interest of other sectors of education are one of the most important national resources for studying existing information
One of the features of informatics as a subject of study is the presence of such a special goal as the development of a general solution in order to lead the analysis to a certain stop of opinion comparison
Certain methods are needed for users to discuss issues that create special conditions for addressing such issues
Telecommunications is a useful tool to boost students and general education
They contribute to the creation of a model for the organization of the educational process, expanding traditional education with the fulfillment of the requirements of modern pedagogical education [3]
Global computer connectivity opens up real opportunities for everyday communication between students and teachers of educational institutions of different cities and states and raises the question of the possibility of creating global abilities of students
In turn, it will facilitate joint action to achieve the common goal of finding new approaches to work
Teleconference - a collection between participants at a territorial distance from each other using telecommunication means
Teleconference Audio Conference (Audio) and Videoconference (Video)
(via devices)
Teleconferences are often used by government members [4]
Teleconference - one of the types of relationships carried out at a distance through special telecommunication devices
A large group of remote communication users with a common topic or teleconference issue
Group communication between participants classified by region via teleconference - teleconference technologies
Teleconference is based on a software and technical environment that provides user interaction
Teleconference technologies - methods and methods of discussion among destroyed user groups
Discussion takes place in real time or in detail view
Teleconference - exchange of messages organized between users on a specific topic
In this case, the message is sent not to the personal address of users, but to a teleconference, that is, to the server, where other Internet users may also be contained
Teleconferences are classified according to the following parameters:
Depending on the types of information exchange - extended periodic (list of newsgroup newsletters) and real-time conferences (through IRC servers - Internet Relay Chat);
according to the method of teleconferences management - moderator (controlled) and moderator (without a driver);
on availability of teleconference materials - open and closed (for registered participants)
Teleconference in Data View - Available:
Recording and description of the topic of discussion;
teleconference using a database that records feedback from conference participants on the topic of discussion
List of items - e-mail in which messages are automatically sent to many recipients, that is, subscribers to the list
Free Forums:
(forum of the Russian magazine);
Technical facilities used for teleconference:
Audio recorders
Teleconference is the communication of a large number of users of the first stage with a common common topic. Messaging during a teleconference is carried out in real time through audio and video communication and by mail
In this case, the term teleconference will be synonymous with echoconferencing to a news group
Teleconference - Audio and Videoconference Foundation
During an audio conference, users can use audio information on the Internet or
exchange services of telecom operators
Video recordings of members during video conferencing are also carried out through voice sets
Also, the discussed information will be used by joint users [5]

This article will address the issue of the distribution of cryptographic keys based on the non-positional polynomial counting system
As you know, the problem of key distribution is a weak point of cryptographic systems in practical implementation, how complex and reliable they are
The proposed article positions the algorithm of classical key exchange between two users through open communication channels
described is an algorithm based on a non-periodic polynomial counting system, for a group of its users there is a jetildriu option
Non-position polynomial counting system (PEPSC) cryptography cryptographic key distribution algorithm
The issue of key distribution is a weak point in their implementation, how complex and reliable cryptographic systems are
In order to be able to exchange confidential information between the two entities of the system in use, who should be distributed with one of them, and then again transferred to the other in a hidden order.
That is, in the general case, the use of any cryptosystems is required to transfer the key
Based on the results, public key systems obtained by classical and modern algebra were proposed to solve this problem.
Their meaning is that two interrelated keys are distributed to each address owner of the system used according to one particular rule
One key is published public and the other private (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Generic Public Key Cryptosystem Approach
The public key has been announced and can be used by anyone who wishes to send a notification
Confidential key stored anonymously
Source cipher is opened and sent with the key from the address owner
A text cipher encrypted based on cannot be opened with the same key
The message cipher can only be opened by the user of a private key known only to the owner of the address
Key Distribution
Key distribution is the most responsible key management process
It has two requirements:
Propagation speed and accuracy
Confidentiality of distributed keys
Recently, there has been a shift towards the use of public key cryptosystems, where there are no problems with the distribution of keys
However, the dissemination of key information in the system used requires new effective solutions
Keys are distributed between users in two different ways:
By creating a distribution center for one or more keys
The disadvantage of this action is who has the keys installed in the distribution center and allows reading of all messages rotating in this used system
Probably
abuse has a significant impact on activities
With direct key replacement among users of information systems
In this case, the question reliably confirms the authenticity of the subjects
To exchange keys, you can use public-key cryptosystems using the same Diffie-Hellman algorithm
The key distribution conclusion to be analyzed is as follows:
The task of key management is to allow session participants to abandon the key distribution center with a mutual authentication mechanism - response.	reliability	confirmation	it	for	software	or	finding a key distribution protocol that would allow hardware to be used in key exchange using the slightest messages

Hellma's proposed algorithm is a procedure for exchanging keys over open communication channels [1 2]
Edit This Exchange Chain
Implementation and use issues include:
First, this prime number is selected by this module
The procedure module should be such that the calculation of the discrete logarithm (DiscLog) is difficult to solve
Currently, some parameters have been developed for the module
For example, it should be strictly simple
Second, the numbers occurring in the open channel interval [0 p 1] during this procedure provide different degrees of protection against attacks depending on the order of their multiplicative group.
In a multiplicative group, a large simple field cannot be deleted due to the inequality of these elements.

Key information dissemination algorithm based on non-positional polynomial counting system
Open key distribution allows subscribers to develop a common secret key by dynamic interaction based on the exchange of open messages without any pre-distributed secret information
An important advantage of public key distribution is that none of the subscribers can determine the value of the key in advance, since it depends on the messages transmitted during the exchange
As the results of practical implementation and theoretical research showed, this scheme has not exhausted all its capabilities
Also proof of this is the proposed key exchange algorithm based on the non-positional polynomial counting system
The use of PEPSC in the formation and study of unconventional electronic digital signature (EDS) coding algorithms and methods will reduce the length of EDS and supplement EDS with error detection and single error correction properties
The results of these studies [3-6] served as the basis for the use of PEPSC in the key distribution process
Key exchange algorithm based on non-positional polynomial counting system
The proposed key exchange algorithm is as follows: [7 8]
First, PEPSC is formed: as a basis (functioning)

These polynomials take into account the order of their location

According to the Great Chinese Waste Theorem, the bases must be different and homogeneous [9-12]
The range of operation of PEPSC is determined by the polyhedron (module)

In this system, any polynomial F (x)

Then the bases need a formula

Then users A and B independently select the corresponding secret keys 1 < kA kB < 2m they are kept secret
Users A and B then calculate the corresponding public keys:

All ranking operations are calculated in a non-positional polynomial reference system, that is, these operations are performed in parallel to the polynomial module selected as the basis of the system
After that, sides A and B are calculated on an unprotected channel

Users A and B then compute the shared secret key using the following comparisons, respectively:

Thus, secret key exchange based on PEPSC works

It is noted that when introducing the classical algorithm, there are difficulties in detecting a primitive field element designed according to a selected prime number
The modules of this algorithm under consideration are opaque polytopes, and therefore there are no problems with the detection of primitive polytopes.
Key exchange algorithm based on a non-positional polynomial counting system for a group of users
When considering the algorithm for distributing cryptographic keys, flexibility is not limited to only two users, but for a group of users is one of the most pressing problems of our time.
This problem occurs when organizing a conference call in the formation of a group electronic digital signature when authenticating group users when establishing secure communication within a group of users
There are several ways to solve this problem
One of these we looked at for the user group of the key transfer algorithm created based on the above PEPSC

The article discusses the algorithm for constructing a short circuit in a coded graph
The mathematical support of the vast majority of automated design and control systems includes methods and algorithms of graph theory as an integral part, which in particular corresponds to the effectiveness of modeling complex systems using mathematical devices of the theory of analysis and synthesis of networks
Linear models are widely used in the study of operations and are used in practice, for example, in the design of energy saving systems, space communication systems of television broadcast networks of computer systems transportation networks, and so on.
In most cases, to ensure the pace of production processes control the level of costs for the schedule of overhaul and replacement of equipment for the scheduling of storage and transportation of goods in the warehouse
Efficient algorithms based on graph theory methods and algorithms based on network analysis methods have been developed to address resource allocation to inventory management as well as many other practical problems
Algorithms for constructing algorithms for searching for graphs not measured by code graphs, algorithms for constructing a horizontal search chain, and the deep search method
Methods and algorithms of graph theory are widely used in modeling the action of complex systems around critical points when studying the electrical properties of composite materials of metal-dielectric origin of crystalline semiconductors with additions of discrete structural homogeneous amorphous semiconductors separately [1]
Assign linked graph components, Create a tree and shortest sequences in graphs
The calculation of the construction of a short circuit between two given vertices of an immeasurable graph arises as a report in applications of graph theory, for example, the calculation of the determination of the maximum flow in a line with limited throughput
It is shown that the algorithm for constructing a tree using the "horizontal search" method can be used to build a short chain L (v0vs) specified between two vertices of the graph v0 and vs [2]
The construction of the sequence of the wanted chain begins with its final ceiling (after the completion of the "horizontal search" algorithm) and is implemented as follows
Wanted L (vs)
c ') create part of the v'∊Vr circuit
If v '≠ V0, then from adjacent vertices of the graph we choose any v "∊Vr-1, i.e. any v" ceiling of the set {N (v') ∩Vr-1}
With the algorithm '1, the ceiling is included in the Vr set only if there is a wall in the graph G (vivj): {}, where the creation of the chain is necessarily completed by including the v0 ceiling in L
In the encoded graph, the computational complexity of the horizontal search algorithm α 1 is O (n), hence the algorithm below for constructing short sequences in the graph with a list of codes of its vertices is O (n) α 1 (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Representation of graph G and its ceilings by code list
If r = 0, then switch to item 2, otherwise r = r - 2d d = [log2r]
a = (s (d) ˄f) if a = 0, the transition to paragraph 3; otherwise t = [log2a]; if t = s then switch to point 6 [found the target vertex vs]
f=f-2t; m (k) = m (k) + 2t; if egerf = 0, then "stop"
L(k)=t; r = L (k); k = k - 1 if k < 0, then "stop" [the construction of the wanted chain L (i) i = 1k is completed - chain number sequence L (v0 vs)]
t = [log2(s(p)˄m(k))]; Transition to item 6 [number "t" of the next ceiling of the chain to be sought]
Consider an example of constructing a short circuit between the vertices of v0vn in the encoded graph G
Let's compose using the method "Depth search" in column G with the root of the tree T until the ceiling vn is included in v0tnb
Then from its last ceiling v11 we proceed to the creation of the wanted chain
The creation of the tree begins with the ceiling v0, that is:
While in the set B1 we find the number of the empty (m (1) = 0) of the first ceiling: t = [log2 (s (0) ˄f)] = [log2 (110 1111 1111 1110) ] = 2
since the W set has the following ceiling: t = [log2a] = [log2 (10)] = l
The ceiling W is included in the set B1:
Now
a = (s (0)  ) = (110    ) = 0
We move to the generation of the set B2, that is, we set the values ​ ​ m (2) = 0 r = m (1), d = [log2r] = [log2 (110)] = 2r = r-22
Since a = (s (2) ˄f) = (10 0011˄1111 1000) = 10 0000 > 0, we include the vertex V in the set B2:
Recalculate the intersection mask of the set (N (V2) ∩𝑉̃}: a = (s (2) ˄f) = (10 0011 1111 1101 1000) = 0
From here, to continue to form the set B2, we proceed to consider the following ceilings of the set B1:
t = [log2a] = [log2 (1 1000)] = 4 i.e. v4 - next set ceiling V2: m (2) = m (2) + 24 = 110000
Now, as a = (s (1) ˄f) = (the 11th 1101 ˄ 1111 1100 1000) = 0 and r = 0, we pass to creation of B3 set:
a = (c (5) ˄f) = (1 0001 0110 ˄ 1111 1100 0000) =  10000 0000 > 0, since
The following ceiling w is included in set B3:
Continuing this way, by including the next ceiling in 11 in the set B4, we get the following:
At the moment bordering the ceiling of v11, we find t 'number kelgV3 hill:
t '= [log2 (s (11) ˄m (3))] = [log2 (101 1000 0000 1 1100 0000)] = 8ygni While the part of the wanted L chain is created, consisting of two vertices L = {v11v8}
To determine the number of the next ceiling of the desired chain, repeat the calculation:
Hence L = {v11v8v5}
We will find the number of any ceiling in the Vl set adjacent to v5:

In conducting research, a new state of questions of computational complexity of algorithms a '1 "depth search" and a' 2 "horizontal search" is considered.
At the same time, the complexity of calculations is estimated by some function in which the maximum allowable time (for all personal calculations of length) with individual calculations of a given length and the proposed algorithm is identified for each input length.
Where input length refers to the number of characters (characters) of the alphabet sufficient to describe the personal report and the unique presentation of the original data
When applying the double alphabet, which is the basis of the machine language of all modern personal computers, {0; 1} Inbound length refers to the length of the information, that is, the number of bits sufficient to describe and source data of the personal report
Considering that the evaluation of the computational complexity of the reports and algorithms given in the work is obtained in relation to the symbolic length of income (that is, in a word that is included regardless of the volume of the incoming number, it can be transmitted by one symbol of any universal alphabet, and in this work the proposed type of representation of graphs and operations {0; l} binary alphabet is used, work is also being carried out to assess the complexity of calculations
It is presented in the description of the report with respect to the symbolic length of the income (denoted via A) with the number of measured symbols of the binary alphabet and with respect to the length of the input information (A ')
A comparative analysis of algorithms considered when applying certain methods of representing graphs in the memory of a personal computer shows that the computational complexity of the search algorithm depends on the selected type of graph representation
The complexity of the calculations given by the adjacent search algorithm matrix or the adjacent list in the alphabet {0; l} relative to the incoming length O (n2log2n)
and with respect to the revenue length given by the number of characters of any universal alphabet is O (n2)
Since this estimate is only necessary to store the necessary graph information in the memory of personal computers, in any particular form at least the symbols O (n2) of any universal alphabet or the symbols of the double alphabet O (n2log2n) are required
A new kind of representation of graphs in the memory of a personal computer in this work
integers - as a list of ceiling codes
For storage of information on the column in the form provided in memory of the personal computer there are enough symbols (0; l} O (n2) or enough symbols O (n) of any universal alphabet, that is, the list of graph ceiling codes is a smaller type of graph representation
The creation of a mechanism for analyzing graph information in the form specified in the memory of a personal computer to create any structural algorithms in encoded graphs provided sufficient grounds for creating such a short circuit in the form of a list of available operations performed by graph ceiling codes

The article will consider the issues of teaching informatics at a comprehensive school
High school students of the natural and mathematical direction of a general education school will be given methods of teaching the section "Information Technologies"
Speaking about the content of the "Information Technologies" section, the design method within the training methods is used during the training of this section.
This article describes how to use the design method in teaching this topic.
Method of designing the professional orientation of the natural and mathematical direction of informatics information technologies
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev's Kazakhstan-2050 strategy says: "To become a competitive developed country, we must become a highly qualified country
Establishment of a system of specialized educational institutions for research and applied education throughout the country, taking into account regional specialties
the creation of educational courses of entrepreneurial-oriented educational programs "at present, the school sets the tasks of professional training for each subject at the highest scientific level with a clear mastery of the foundations of science for improving the quality of education and education
Updating education will require the development of a model of schools of a new type, new textbooks and curricula, as well as the use of new methods of teaching the computer science course assignment system
Raising schools to a new level by personalizing training in the results of computer science training will require deeper education of high school students in the natural and mathematical direction
In modern schools, the need to improve the methodology of mathematical and natural training of computer science to high school students is known, since they relate to educational subjects designed for the full and effective implementation of differentiated learning tasks both in terms of computer science and content
In particular, since a meaningful information technology network is often complemented in connection with the development of the information society, it is necessary to consider improving the training methodology by creating the conditions for implementing a personal-oriented approach to personalizing the training of this meaningful network
Summing up the above, it is necessary to distinguish the content and means of the informatics content network in the natural and mathematical direction [12]
To clarify the natural and mathematical direction, first of all, it is worth noting the concept of professional orientation
Professional orientation is a focused activity to prepare young people for the choice of the appropriate profession with appropriate personal inclinations and suitable social needs for personnel of a special specialty and various qualifications
It is clear that the idea of ​ ​ differentiation (differentiation) in the formation of the professional orientation of high school students is of particular importance in the educational process
For this qualification, each student learns the minimum level of use of information and communication technologies
In order to develop the professional orientation of high school students based on information and communication technologies, it is necessary to provide an education system that can, firstly, be based on a clear higher education, and secondly, apply this technology in accordance with the future specialization.
When mastering the subject "Informatics" for the natural-mathematical direction, the departments of algorithms of informatics and means of informatization of information technologies are considered in order to reveal the possibilities of application in the field of technical and natural-scientific activities [3]
In high schools of the natural and mathematical direction, the following aspects are adopted as the basis for the content of the subject "Informatics":
reflection of the modern state of informatics as a fundamental science in accordance with the school course;
reflecting the importance of informatics as a scientific discipline based on the diversification of the content of training through the concept of "information technologies";
patriotism of morality and morality of educational material
enrichment of educational values;
the formation and development of students' thinking to prevent them from armed themselves with the flow of excessive information;
training in effective information management;
active application of internal political and interdisciplinary links of the course of informatics;
training in how to apply knowledge and skills developed in practice
The content of this discipline is determined on the basis of these requirements for the level of training of high school students in the natural and mathematical direction
Including the content of the section "Information Technologies" on research: 3D modeling and animation
Virtuality is one way to know the real world
Change and move the preamble to the 3D space orientation Program interface - objects; Bull operation in the program; Modifiers
Mirror - mirror image; texture in a blender
Materials in blender, etc.
consists of
The course of training in informatics of the natural and mathematical direction on the topic of research is considered
Teaching of informatics using new methods of teaching different methods
In accordance with the calendar and thematic plan, the methodology for studying the section "Information Technologies" in the 10th class of informatics of the natural and mathematical direction is proposed
For Information Technology Chapter Training
Knowledge gained in the subject "Methodology of training in informatics" received knowledge that efficiency from teaching methods is a design method as a result of differentiation of opinions in our own work that performs power skills
In connection with the introduction of information and communication technologies in the training process, today the most effective of several methods, as proved by world and pedagogical practice, is the design method
The design method is a comprehensive training method that individualizes the learning process for the student.
planning		organization	and	actions	to control	to read	requires a different organization of the structure of the educational process through the purposeful actions of the student, combining them with personal interests and goals that allow you to fulfill tasks in the creative direction
The importance of such a method in learning is that for each student the opportunity to work depending on their pace and mode of action
Hence, the method of designing creative survey works for the development of student interest in the educational process	to create	to stimulate	independently		research	works	planning and development of skills of collective labor organization to increase activity in conversion of information to conducting
strive to shape action
Its specificity is to determine the result of project activities on student actions (practical-oriented research information creative role-playing projects) (experimental articles to solve socially significant problems, scenarios of any game action, etc.
) actions are taken
The solution to the problem by the design method begins with planning
In accordance with the goal, each project requires research work by students
Another feature of the project activity is the search for interpreted and displayed information processed by the project team members
This will be done depending on the professional activities of any teacher
The topic (design) according to the rules of mastering the subject of informatics by the design method should correspond to the curriculum and arouse interest among the student; the role of the teacher is changing, he should be only the organizer and adviser; search attempts during project training
an assembly operation will be organized
In accordance with such conclusions, we offer an extract from the methodological instruction for training in the design method of the topic "3D max modifiers"
Project Objective:

developing self-employment skills;
Developing information skills (information structuring reflects different forms of information that distinguish the beginning of information analysis)
Education:
developing a sense of responsibility;
develop the desire for success and the desire to improve themselves;
development of environmental culture of students;
Show the family their love for the school class in the city of the history of their homeland

at least a page;
the pages contained table figures;
Create software using blenes or 3 D max;
An explanation drawn up in accordance with the relevant requirements should be accompanied by a letter
Proposed project topics: Model Gantel; Ball model; Bar model
The project method implements the final idea of ​ ​ the project, in which one practical or theoretical issue will be considered, the result is achieved
When creating a project, the student can independently search for and understand information and create new ideas
The current person is growing in the conditions of dynamic growth in the information sphere
The goal of the school is to teach students to independently find answers to questions arising in the way of life, to assess the consequences of their actions and take responsibility for them, which makes it possible to gain self-education and development skills, which will become the basis of knowledge collected in the process of life, in a creative state.
In these conditions, the school should develop modern changes, developing the properties of constructivity and constructivity among its students
In general, the mastery of the subject of informatics on the basis of the design method guarantees, firstly, an increase in the quality of education, and secondly, the development of the student's personal abilities in accordance with modern requirements; thirdly, develop their educational motivation, showing the importance of the educational process for the student; fourthly, the condition for parallel implementation of the three objectives of the learning process - educational and educational development; the fifth will be based on the full harmonious development of the requirements of society and the interests of students, and the learned knowledge will be transferred to the competence

This paper describes the principles and properties of constructing Bezier curves
Bezier curves and surfaces are used in all modern programs working with vector graphics
Their main advantage is that they are characterized by a mathematical formula through the points of the curve
The peculiarity is that the image can be transformed without loss of quality
Using Bezier curves and surfaces on web sheets increases the capabilities of design solutions and contributes to its unlikely
Bezier curves Bezier Spline page parametric equation web design
Currently, Bezier curves are used in all modern programs working with vector graphics
The main advantage of their application is the absence of the need to remember each point of the curve - firstly, knowledge of its initial and final coordinates and secondly, knowledge of the mathematical formula characterizing the curve.
As a result, free transformation of the vector image is achieved without loss of any quality
Vector graphics are based on vector loops
These include geometric primitives and shapes drawn from different curves
All of them are vector Bezier curves, named after the French mathematician Pierre Bezier, who first used them in modeling the body of cars [1]
Spline - an even curve consisting of two or more support points, as well as control points that affect the shape of the spline located outside of it
Bezier and P
Casteljo proposed a simple and effective method for constructing curves and surfaces
Obtained a set of adjustable poles - points in Euclidean space with finite dimension as the primary object of the method proposed by them
Erection was carried out using a parametric version of the linear interpolation method conducted according to the sequence (1) - (3)
Now this method is called the Castelljo algorithm, and curves and surfaces constructed using the Castelljo algorithm are called Bézier curves and surfaces
where t is used as a parameter corresponding to the coordinates of an individual line point
Consider the decomposition of Bezier curves by values
(two)
by point)
The curve is formed in a section defined by the endpoints P0 and P1 (Figure 1)
Parametric equation

Slice defined by endpoints P0 and P1

Outputs (Figure 2):
each side of the polygon contour extending along the guide points t
proportional to the value
dividing points are connected to parts of the line and form a new polygon
Number of nodes of the new loop along with the number of nodes of the previous loop
the sides of the new loop are again proportional to the value and t
shares
This continues until the point of the Bezier curve is detected, which is the only point of distribution [3]
The 3rd order Bezier curve segment is characterized by the location of four points
Two of them are datum points (curve nodes):
and endpoint P3
P1 determining the location
and P2
Points (x2 y2) are called control points
The method of maintaining the bezier curve is based on the application of a pair of slits (control salts) to its segments at the end of the curve
The shape of the curve is affected by the angle of bending of the shield and the length of its part (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Bezier Curves
The Bezier parameter equation characterizes the position of the points and thereby the shape of the curve
Solves the equation with respect to the parameter t, which takes values ​ ​ from 0 (source point) to 1 (endpoint) (5) - (7)
When erecting a segment of a Bezier curve, the x and y coordinates in the plane are calculated (for four points with two controls inside):
where 0 < t < 1;
The value t determines the degree to which points affect the shape of the curve
For example, at t = 0333 to the maximum "weight" point P1 a t  0
Has point P2 at 666
Curve of given equations only (P0 P3) primary and final strut of segment
Left	through	Bezier (river)	curve	are convinced of the simplicity and stability of the description
The main properties of the Bezier curve are:
−	segment	initial	and	the last	points	between	continuity of filling;
−	The curve is always located inside the shape that occurs through the lines connecting the control points.
−	the segment has the shape of a straight line with only two test points.
occurs in the case of a collinear (in one plane) location of straight control points;
The Bezier curve is symmetric, that is, moving the start and end points (changing the direction of the path) does not affect the shape of the curve;
Scaling the Bezier curve and changing its dimensions disturbs the stability of the curve, since it is "athenistic invariant" from a mathematical point of view;
Changing the coordinates of one point changes the shape of the entire Bezier curve.
The curve level is always less than the number of datum points per unit (that is, the shape of the curve is a parabola with the number of datum points three);
Placing additional datum points around one position increases its "weight" and offsets the curve path to a given position.
a circle cannot be described by the parametric equation of a Bezier curve;
except in trivial cases where parallel Bezier curves (straight lines and corresponding curves) cannot be constructed [4]
This property is based on the fact that at each step the sections are divided relative to t
The result is a point dividing the original polygon into two polygons and above the curve.
This allows you to take into account the shape of the curve in interactive modeling, as well as carry out calculations in parallel
The development of a software product, that is, the creation of a site is a creative process, and the selection of processing tools takes an important place here
The site editing path depends on the selection, for example, if you select HTML, then we chose the script programming path
In this regard, the process of processing and operation of the site will be determined
The Bezier method is one of the most convenient methods for interactive approximation of curves
In addition, to indicate pages, a simple method of controlling page parameters will be obtained, extended naturally
Page rotation vectors are the basis for interactive page layout mapping
CSS animation (time function definition) and t
The vision of the program simulating superimposition of bezier curves is given
(Figure 4) In the developed program, you can study how the Bezier curves change, increasing or decreasing the number of points
These changes can be used in design settings because they are listed on web pages
Understanding the principles of the Bezier curves extends its scope

The article provides for the use of the map-intelligence method as a tool for developing the intellectual potential of a student
Relevance of this study analyzed in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Intel Map defines "Mind maps"
Basic principles of radiant thinking are given
The experience of using the map-intelligence in the educational process as a whole was analyzed
There are also examples of using the map-intelligence method in the process of training in information disciplines.
Intellectual potential of the intellectual map of personality thinking
Practice shows the need of society for people who, in the context of the dynamic growth of the socio-political and economic status of the Republic of Kazakhstan, can actively influence the increase in the competitiveness of the state, affecting developing ideas in accordance with real changes that can think of intellectually developed talent
Kazakh society's desire for global educational standards is explained by the strategic goal of reforming the education system, which ensures the creation of favorable conditions for the realization of their intellectual and creative potential for the development of young people with established intellectual potential
As resources for developing the intellectual potential of a student in modern society, systems of general and higher education of various creative associations can be obtained:
Currently, the education system of the Republic of Kazakhstan is undergoing a process of reform
His philosophy is based on the understanding of the definition of the intellectual role of the individual in the development of society in the continuous unity of man and nature
The relationship in which modern social reality calls for the formation of an innovative culture in the context of innovative research and meets it from the point of view of the intellectual capabilities of the individual coincides with the period when scientific communities review the goals and objectives of educational systems that advocate the need to study the role of intellectual potential in innovative processes in modern society
The social practices of recent years show conflicting trends in intellectual capacity-building due to the diversity of social and cultural systems
The current state of the education system, aimed at meeting the needs and learning needs of the student, implies the self-realization of the personality and the development of its creative potential
This requires today's teaching community to find new methods and tools to ensure this process, based on health issues
With regard to the basic objective of education, the key role is not to prepare for education, but to address the adaptation of the individual to social life.
According to the work of researchers who conducted research in this direction
in the queue emphasizes the need to take into account the psychological aspect of the health problem
A reasonable solution to this issue will ensure the disclosure of personal competencies, will allow you to study the legality of becoming a future specialist as a professional
In most cases, as practice has shown, the teacher primarily strives to provide large-scale knowledge to students transmitting the bulk of information in the form of lectures, and as a result, the text list makes up a typical table, etc.
it is summarized
The traditional concept reflects a logical time chain of information characterizing knowledge and skills in the form of a chronological chain
The processing of information in this way is aimed at the work of the left hemisphere of the brain ("logical"), which helps to master specific scientific fields, such as mathematics, logic, physics and chemistry
Actions performed according to the model are directed to the formation of real figurative thinking and are accompanied by analytical activities (N
At the same time, it is difficult to say that a concept written in simple sequences is a reliable means of storing information
Dialogue relations between the teacher and the student, being the main form of organization of the educational process, should be aimed at developing logical analytical creative thinking and the intellectual potential of the person (ability to function and independent memory control)
To carry out their actions, the teacher must use a tool, the result of which is the cognitive activity of the student
At the beginning of the 20th century, the term "gestalt" appeared to describe the process of thinking
"Gestalt" (Gestalt - a form translated from German) - the memory of the perception of the world passing in the brain, etc.
characterizes the integrity of mental processes such as
Ehrenfels is considered one of the founders of gestalt psychology in Germany
This term indicates that all processes taking place in the mind are one, firstly, covering the whole part of the brain - both hemispheres of the brain, secondly, its three-dimensional nature is explained by the fact that information spreads in an unpredictable way throughout the whole part of the brain
Diagrams of hierarchical structures and samples, etc., with any other information
do not follow the filled classic inspection
We comprehensively study the subject, and derivative thoughts appear in memory, which are difficult to describe in the space of a one-dimensional concept
This is primarily due to the specifics of human brain structure [1]
Based on the term gestalt, the principle of radiant thinking opens
By exciting a different part of the brain, we influence its "three-dimensional" structure, which allows us to create an associative series from an incompatible part of concepts
This three-dimensional structure goes beyond the presentation of information in the form of a classic concept, since connections lead to various questions about this problem without directly linking to the subject under study.
For example, in connection with the word "photographer," "equipment" cannot have a connection with the words "quality," as well as "family" (photo album containing family photos) "holiday" (favorite holiday photos), etc.
words may appear
The classical or hierarchical concept is not capable of generating new thoughts, and is also unsuitable for "brain attack"
The need to find a new way to record information based on the principle of radiant thinking, American scientist Tony Busen Mind
this led to the emergence of a new concept called map
This term is currently translated under different names: "mental map" "thinking map" "mind map" and other alternatives
The most common of them is called "map-intelligence"
Its author, known as Mind maps, is the famous writer, lecturer on the psychology of learning and thinking Tony Buzen
Alternative translations of the intelligence card also sound in terms such as "mental card" "thinking card" [2]
An intelligence map is a way of displaying a general system thinking process that provides an alternative way to record linear information using models
This approach is based on the principle of radiant thinking related to the process of associative thinking (its additional point is the central object, on the basis of which an infinite spectrum of possible connections is formed
This method of recording information is added to the map-intelligence without restrictions [3]
Intelligence - the area of ​ ​ the card is quite extensive
In particular, planning your time to decide on presentations, organizing and conducting an "attack on the brain" with a large amount of information, independent training and self-development, etc.
Map-intelligence can be used to prepare clear lectures in the field of education
Today, in the formation and development of the intellectual potential of students, an intelligence map occupies a special place
The intellectual potential of a person reflects the totality of his mental abilities
And the development of intellectual potential means an increase in the volume of knowledge received by the student, an increase in the speed of its adoption, an analysis of concepts and relationships and abstract symbols of the ability to adapt to new conditions (H
In this case, the intelligence card can be used as a means for effective information interaction between the information source and its user
Intelligence map is a suitable tool that allows you to visually structure information and display the process of thinking
The map-intelligence is based on the assumption of the nature of memory structuring and processing to understand information for the human brain:
associative thinking;
hierarchical thinking;
visual thinking
In the process of working with information, the intelligence map is used at the stages of information synthesis and analysis
The intelligence map is an intermediate product, the result of processing the received information about the object
In subsequent periods, this information is analyzed and the lecture is drawn up in the form of report research
Analysis of conducted studies related to the use of an intelligence map in training provides increased educational motivation and feedback, the use of which in educational activities is aimed at disseminating the systematization of visual representation of information about the object under study
Intelligence map as a learning method is a tool for transforming information into knowledge
This will make it possible to form the skills of students to generalize and analyze the basic concepts of working with information
This method can be used at all stages of training
Intelligence map can be presented as a project for students working in the group
Current computer science course in secondary school in primary school
there is a learning experience aimed at using the intelligence map method
Experience in organizing and conducting integrated computer science classes in primary school [4]
As for universities, in Western countries, freshmen will be taught as an entrance course
And we cannot call the systematic use of this method in the educational process, which is used only as the desire and desire of private teachers
In our practice, we use this method in the research work of students in lecture courses, as well as in monitoring the educational process
The method of creating an intellectual map is an effective tool in the field of intellectual actions, requiring the analysis of various information of a large volume
- map can be made on each subject even on one topic - on complex lectures
This lecturer is a visual aid for how much material is transferred in this lecture and what new knowledge the student mastered at the end of the lecture, as well as what foundations of knowledge should be zeroed out before passing the lecture and are effective for summing up the results of previous lectures
This method is also useful for monitoring the transfer of lectures to another teacher when analyzing the conceptual apparatus of the subject when checking the compatibility of programs of different disciplines (for example, informational disciplines)
As an active teaching method, students can be instructed to create an intelligence map to test the level of knowledge and understanding of theoretical knowledge in practical classes as an effective tool for testing the knowledge of students of the intelligence map
Our practice has shown the efficiency of using smart cards in the process of training in information disciplines
The subject of programming is one of the main subjects of training future teachers of informatics
Successful mastering of the subject of programming is one of the most important reasons for future computer science teachers who pass in the field of Olympic programming in a secondary school
The preparation of schoolchildren for the Olympics is one of the main indicators of the success of a school teacher
To better explain any subject, the teacher must be able to depict the structure of the subject in the sample
It requires from the teacher, first of all, deep knowledge of the subject, and secondly, requires the choice of an effective tool that would demonstrate it
As such a tool, you can get a map-intelligence
The fundamental concepts of the subject of programming can create an individual intellectual map and complement each topic through it
It is known that learning any programming language begins with its basic concepts, so the intelligence map created on this first topic is replenished with each new topic.
The main topics devoted to individual intelligence-map in the programming discipline: basic concepts of language, data types, language operators can call basic and auxiliary programs
Smart maps created on these topics allow you to clearly display the full structure of the subject
This is an effective tool for summarizing students' knowledge of programming subjects
The creation of an intelligence map on the topics passed can be entrusted to the student as an independent work
The same map-intelligence can be created in all information disciplines
Using this method will increase the creative activity of the student in the development of the system of thinking
An intelligence card made by a student, executed creatively
can be regarded as one of the indicators of intellectual potential

In the article, the limit of a function is determined in a different way than before
A set of function definitions and a set of values consists of merging sets of elements without ownership with specific numbers and a sign
Introduced the concept of continuity using the geometric image of the function
Analyzing the examples needed to determine the limit of a function
Then the limit of the function is defined using the concept of continuity
Infinite Geometric Infinity Mapping
Introduction
The established structure of the course of mathematical analysis consists of the following scheme: product continuity limit
that is, the concept of the limit of a function is first introduced, then the product of the continuity of the function through the limit and t
concepts defined
Defining the limit of a function usually in chain language (Heine)
Koshi Help) or  in  (Koshi Help)
and we see that due to the predominance of abstract aspects of these definitions, the student cannot immediately understand them
In our opinion, if we establish the order of determining the concepts of the course of mathematical analysis according to the following scheme: continuity limit product
there you could get many of its rational results
In particular, the student abstractly perceived the definition of the limit of a function, easily understanding the concept of continuity of a function from its geometrically apparent image; and the transition from the definition of the continuity of the function to the concept of the limit is not difficult, in which case the value of the limit of the function is also determined; the method of learning, which we also specify by the time factor, is several times more rational than the previous method of learning the limits of functions
We aim to show the above structure of the method of determining the limits of functions in our article without going into the theory of limits
Symbol designations and necessary concepts
Point as a whole (specific)

One of the elements
we speak
Value sets and function definitions have specific numbers and symbols

We also use the following signs [1] 15 b
the interval is called the  neighborhood of the actual number
O  (a)  (a  a );
However, mathematics uses the symbol , called delusions (number without ownership)
No sequential relation to unsigned failures
Its  surroundings are recorded as follows:
right side of point a and its symbol:
left side of point a and its symbol:
If the point itself is removed from the vicinity of point a, it is a point.

According to the above six surroundings, there are six openings:

Concepts of Continuity and Function Limit
Function
Point without interruption or interruption to find its limit at point x0
attention is paid to availability
Continuity if the function at this point is continuous
limit by definition:
And if
at point x0
if the function is not defined, then using different methods
x0 function
at point without interruption and limit
what happened 	functions
replaces
Then, using the continuity of the function , it goes under it into a bowl:
Special attention should be paid to the situation with these statements
If	f
functions
x0 - without interruption or
break point to be repaired (otherwise x0 function)
point has no limit)
Function f, if
Not defined at x0, but its limit at this point
We see that the x0 function is the point of the break being repaired
Alay
if there is	f	functions
x	at point (see (1)) f
as
if determined, then x0
converts to a continuous function at a point
We bring here
the definition of the limit of the function is based on this
Consider an example that reveals the value of this method
For example
function x0  1
not defined at point, but it is
at point, it has a limit of 0 (Figure 1)
So his
at point is zero
If you determine what is happening, then there is no break at this point
functions
we get it (see Figure 2)
Received function
equal and
using its continuity due to continuity at the point
we receive
Figure 1
Of course, this method is not always implemented
For example, above
the function in question
x1 not defined at 1 point
But no way functions
We cannot determine what will be continuous at this point
The case where this function has no limit at the point, that is, the argument x x1 cannot contain any numbers or elements so that the function tends to the point 1
For other interrupt points of function by function scheme as indicated here, we can explain to the reader that it will be continuous or interruptible
You can then proceed to the analytical definition of function continuity at the point
There are several types of function continuity definitions
Give the following definition as an example
function f
Define in the area of  U  x0 point x0 (2p

The article provides for the need to study the arithmetic foundations of Farabi's theory of music, which made a significant contribution to the formation of Kazakh mathematics
The basis was the work of scientists who studied the mathematical heritage of Farabi and the theory of music
Basic provisions of arithmetic on farabi are proposed and positions of music theory are given
And in music theory, Farabi discussed in detail approaches to digital relations
In order to find out what the music received from arithmetic, Farabi's rules for actions performed by relationships were proposed
Main words: arithmetic arithmetic; Farabi Heritage Music Theory
Kazakh scientist Farabi has a huge contribution to science and fame around the world
Unfinished wealth, each work of which at one time managed to recognize the scientists of Muslim countries
Surprisingly, Farabi's mathematical physical works are very popular, and the theory of music is associated with mathematics, giving its own rules and calculations
Music theory among his works requires a lot of discussion
The study of his works is a great work, especially from the point of view of the arithmetic of music theory and the training of schoolchildren
The noble scientific creativity of our ancestor is recognized by Aristotle of the East for world culture and scientific discoveries
About 160 treatises of scientific heritage left to future generations have reached our time
And the most shocking of Farabi's works is the musical sphere
According to Farabi, the scientific foundation of music consists of the principles of experimental control and physical and mathematical sciences
He studied the mathematical heritage of Farabi and the theory of music A.
Babesov [1] D
Matyakubov [3] and t
the works of scientists recently intend to comprehensively study the mathematical heritage of our ancestor and introduce it into the modern education system.
Bidibekov's scientific works [4] served as the basis for the proposed study
The results of the study allow secondary school students to further understand arithmetic in quantitative relations
The fact that Farabi connects music with other sciences, arithmetic and algebra, increases the interest of schoolchildren in mathematics, helps to recognize another application of methods performed in quantitative relations
And when considering some important provisions proposed by Farabi in connection with the theory of music (including arithmetic), you can notice two in accordance with the arithmetic of modern high school
Let's focus on some of them
Farabi's theory of music is closely related to arithmetic and algebra, in the creation of which he used arithmetic-algebraic methods to a clear extent
In the "List of Sciences," entering the traditions of the ancient Greeks, he refers the theory of music to the mathematical sciences
Farabi defines the subject of the science of music as follows: "As for the science of music, it consists in the study of the genres of music: why they are created in order to make their sound more spectacular.
Two sciences are recognized by this name: firstly, the practical science of music, secondly, the theoretical science of music "
Based on this, it is known that the science of numbers is divided into practical and theoretical arithmetic
And Farabi's practical arithmetic studies the numbers, because the number of questions is in the numbers that are considered necessary to determine and
For example, the number of horses, dirhams of religions and other objects
And the theoretical arithmetic, the opposite of practical arithmetic, absolutely studies numbers other than those that can be considered substances that can really be felt, and the numbers here are used as common numbers for things that cannot be compatible for sensitive ones.
And Farabi, in turn, divides theoretical arithmetic into three sections:
all that corresponds to the presence of numbers that are not related to each other (for example, odd and even numbers are square numbers, flat and non-family numbers, etc.
) the doctrine of the studied individual numbers;
the idea of ​ ​ dependent numbers studying equality and inequality of numbers arising in comparison with each other, that is, a particular number is one or more parts of another number, either multiplicity or equality to it, or the presence of a proportionally or disproportionately similar size or inconsistency
Farabi relates the doctrine of the ratio and proportion of numbers to this part of theoretical arithmetic
the doctrine of approaches applied to numbers examining properties that occur when dividing one number by several units of another number while increasing one number by several units while reducing the number from one number to one
He studies all this and what happens when he contacts each other and how numbers from certain certain numbers are taken
In general, the science of all the things that can be obtained from this number
In the treatise "The Big Book of Music," he is the subject of theoretical arithmetic, but especially focused on the ratio of numbers used in music theory
In this regard, the last part of the preamble in his treatise, and the following opinion of Farabi, is of great interest: "Everything you need to know about this music is used in the doctrine of arithmetic.
Where, as mentioned above, the value of tones and intervals must be determined and represented by separate numbers.
with respect to the values, it is indicated on which side should be considered for numbers "
Here Farabi is used as an integer and a fractional number
interesting terms are "individual numbers" (adadd al-mufrada) "relative numbers" (adadd al-mudafa)
Thus, theoretical and practical arithmetic, complementing each other, is in an integral unit
In the preamble of The Big Book of Music, Farabi asks questions about the science of numbers that can be used to build music theory
He calls them the rules of arithmetic
Farabi believed that the ratio of numbers would be double, that is, equality and inequality of relations
He wrote: "If you compare two numbers, then they will be equal or unequal"
In the treatise, Al Farabi considers in detail approaches to digital relations, which are widely used in music theory
Farabi writes about it
"If we can explain how the following three reports are solved, then we can say that we showed everything that music received from arithmetic:
A series of numbers has certain relationships with each other
We need to find two such numbers whose relationships include all relationships
Two numbers are in a certain relation to each other
We need to find common numbers that retain this relationship in the original relation
Two numbers in a given relation have a common term between them to get their sum from the initial access
It is necessary to find a number that gives us a residual ratio, that is, the remainder of the original ratio compared to the sum
The solution to the first report is to find the sum of two numbers
The solution to the second report is by dividing one ratio by one, and the third by reducing one ratio from the other.
Thus, Farabi establishes three methods performed by numerical relations - the distribution (classification) of additions and the reduction of relations
Here he offers a simple method of solving the three mentioned reports that arose depending on the theory of music
At the same time, Farabi is limited to considering only the type of quantitative relations that are necessary for this purpose.
Where separation and reduction of addition mean classification and division of multiplication according to tradition
The addition, which arose due to the auxiliary characteristics of these information necessary to build the theory of Farabian music, leads without evidence the rule of distribution (classification) and reduction of relations
The rules for its inclusion differ in two cases: 1) the attached relations are equal to one; 2) attached relations are not equal to each other
With regard to the first case, he writes: If we are talking about adding one relation to another with equality, then we get this relation in the simplest form
Multiply each of the two terms by ourselves
Received copies are in search contact with each other
It can be written as follows:
This rule is given by the following example:
relations
relationships (the simplest of these relationships)
terms 4 and 3), and the latter multiply by ourselves
Then these two numbers give the numbers 16 and 9, respectively
The ratio of these numbers will look for
In this example,
And Farabi will summarize this rule for any number of connections needed
He gives a similar rule for unequal relations: if the attached relations are not equal to each other, then they are either consistent
or is not sequential
For example 1 1
and 1 1
relationship chain
and the relations 1 1 are not consistent
If the joining relations are sequential, then we see that the minimum number in one of the relations of each of them will be the largest simultaneously in the other relation
So we get three sequences - two extreme and one mean
The ratio of the maximum number to the minimum will sum the ratio
Farabi calls the "chain" the following relationship
their addition consists of:
or
Further, Farabi: "When both relationships to be added are not equal or consistent, we will give them in the following form: we get their simplest terms
They give us four numbers
The largest of them has the extreme value - the smallest of the extreme values ​ ​
Two intermediate numbers, average numbers: one closer to the largest extreme number, the other to the extreme subset
If you multiply a number close to the maximum by a smaller number, and a number close to the least, then both the obtained numbers will have the desired ratio. "
At least Farabi considers the following relationships to be a "non-contact" relationship:
and t
they are enabled according to the rules specified
For example
1 and
When the ratios are added, four numbers will be obtained:
Them
we get the ratio below, which according to the specified rule has the desired ratio with double multiplication
Thus, the addition of Farabi's relationship coincides in meaning with today's rules for multiplying details
As noted above, the division of Farabi relations is the division of a given relation into several other relations, the sum of which is equal to the original relation
This is a special approach that arose on the basis of music theory, which was used as an arithmetic apparatus when classifying the intervals of quarts into changing (modulating) organs
To divide relationships, Farabi proposes the following rule: If we want to divide the same relationship into several others, then we create a series of relationships whose members differ between themselves by the same magnitude or different magnitude
In the first case, we divide as follows: the prime terms of this relation are multiplied by a number equal to the number of sections that we need to draw
So we get two numbers that will become the new extreme members of the relationship that should be separated
Intermediate numbers are at a distance from each other in the desired ratio
And Farabi followed this rule as follows
gives an example:
Simple terms of relation 4 are equal to each other
let's set the goal to divide into three other ratios that differ from the values ​ ​
The numbers 3 and 4, that is, the terms of this relation are multiplied by 3
Comes out 12 and 9
Between these numbers are two average numbers, that is, 11 and 10
So we got three
we get 1 1 1 and 1 and four members 1 1
In general, this rule can be written as follows:
it should be divided into relationships
According to the specified rules:
the ratio n is  set
Here in meaning, and the extreme members of Farabi
(n  d) kn and
relies on the detection of numbers that make up an arithmetic progression with a difference of d  (n  d)
In this example	k  3 - difference of 12 and 9 according to end members
d 4 3 1 therefore
This example is not chosen by chance, since in this case only "often encountered" relationships in music are involved in the classification.
And Farabi proposes a rule for another case in which the same relationship has to be divided into several other relations, the members of which differ from each other by a different number
To do this, Farabi proposes to divide the first given relation according to the specified method into several other relations, the terms of which differ from each other by the same number, then these obtained relations in turn are distributed in this way.
Farabi takes into account that there will be other forms of classification of quantitative relations
Reducing relationships, and Farabi sees as the opposite approach to including relationships
He proposes a rule similar to that existing in the meaning of the rule of distribution of details: "If we need to get from one relation to another, then we use the following rule: we get the simplest members from both relations, multiply the smallest member of the first communication by the largest member of the second communication, and then increase the maximum member of the first relation to the youngest member of the last
As a result of these two actions, two numbers are obtained that are in residual contact with each other.
It can be written as follows:
This rule is given in the following example: if we 1 1
1 Relationship 1
If we have to access, then we have to have according to the simple members of these two relationships:
Note 4 and 3 3 and 2
3 i.e. 1  1
Maximum Communication Member
that is,
multiplied by the smallest term of the ratio 2 by 4
we multiply
As a result of these two actions, we get two digits, that is, 9 and 8 of them.
that is, 1 1
the message to be searched will be residual
In this example:
Farabi when receiving different musical intervals of different groups
skillfully uses all the techniques performed by relationships, and also solves questions of an arithmetic-computational nature, which are the most difficult for a variety
Here he manifests himself as a skillful computational practitioner
One example is that dividing a quarter into small intervals is one of the main calculations of mathematical music theory
And Farabi paid a lot of attention to this issue
He proposed his experimental and mathematical method of solving this report, that is, calculating the distribution of the quarter
When dividing a quarter into appropriate types by this method, Farabi applies many approaches to different numerical relations, giving their results in the form of several tables
At the same time, it should be noted that Farabi's theory of music is trying to reflect the obtained quantitative relations in the traditions that have developed between mathematicians of three-dimensional time, that is, using the most basic details.
However, all types of basic parts are found in Farabi
In summary, we do not know all the works of Farabi of arimetic content, but the above analysis of their well-known works allows us to note the great achievements of methodological and practical arithmetic in terms of specific issues
In connection with arithmetic, the work of which involves modern school arithmetic, young students will have great opportunities to understand arithmetic, comparing the things presented by them and the data in a modern textbook
Farabi's theory of music has been studied by scholars-historians, philosophers and specialists in the field of music for a thousand years and is currently, although mathematical arithmetic has been little studied
Therefore, the need to study the arithmetic foundations of Farabi music theory requires a lot of research

Such nonlinear effects are modeled by nonlinear differential equations
Some of these equations are integrated and called soliton equations
Integration Compression Systems and Surface Curve Symbols
that is, the year of geometry One of the main sections of integrable nonlinear differential equations are integrable spinal systems and are very important in mathematics, in particular in the geometry of surfaces and curves
On the other hand, integrable spinal systems play a decisive role in describing nonlinear phenomena in magnets

The article provides for the main issues of teaching mathematics at school and pedagogical university, as well as the use of the acquired knowledge in solving practical calculations
It will also study the professional quality of a specialist who will be able to apply his knowledge in practice and transfer pedagogical literacy to students
In accordance with the didactic goal, the teacher is recommended to classify reports that assist in the implementation of the selection of reports
Training in mathematical teaching, mathematical analysis of the algebra course of a school pedagogical higher educational institution
For several years, the secondary school changed its status, alternative educational institutions, gymnasiums of lycées, specialized schools with in-depth study of individual subjects appeared
In accordance with these changes, new requirements for the work of teachers were presented, and also requires professional training when studying at a university
A highly qualified specialist must not only master the basics of science, but also transfer his knowledge to students with pedagogical literacy
The issue of mathematical training of the future teacher still remains relevant
Mathematics - will teach methods of studying theoretical and practical problems that allow you to study and understand knowledge of the environment
Mathematics at all times plays an important role in scientific, technical and economic development
At present, due to the growing role of mathematics, for most organizers of programmers of future production economists, complex mathematical training is needed, which will allow large-scale research of new problems by mathematical methods, applying in practice the theoretical achievements of modern computer technology
Creative solution of the problem that arises before the most important qualities of a specialist, researchers say
Here you need to understand that the term of creativity is the creation of the necessary mathematical model and the study of it
It is not allowed to replace by teaching a number of applications and methods of studying the subject of mathematics without explaining mathematical concepts and meanings without taking into account the internal world of mathematics
Specialists trained in this way study new specific phenomena
may be untenable in due time, as it is not used to considering the necessary mathematical and abstract mathematical models
Therefore, the content of a general course of mathematics without taking into account the internal logic of mathematics and a reasonable rigid representation cannot be determined from a purely pragmatic point of view, based solely on the specifics of future students of specialties [1]
In Kazakhstan, the current stages of secondary education: primary (1 4 classes) is the main (5 9 classes) higher (10 11 classes)
Study in algebra at school begins with the seventh grade
Algebra is one of the most important areas of mathematics
It is the language of science and technology
It predicts and explores many phenomena and processes occurring in nature and society.
The subject of algebra provides training in other school disciplines, primarily disciplines of the natural and mathematical direction, in particular physics of informatics of geometry [2]
According to research, today from the point of view of students, the course of algebra is perceived as the science of solving equations
But in the XIX-XX centuries, its content changed dramatically as a science of a special type of algebraic mathematical structures - primarily, circle rings and fields
These objects are the basis of school algebra, which remains a "shadow" depth, not clearly formulated
In fact, the content of school algebra cannot be considered the full content of the subject and the goal of learning only by applying these algebraic concepts
If you include these concepts in the school course of algebra, then in the school there is a situation of misunderstanding of this course, which will contradict the teaching of students of age characteristics
But the teacher must talk about some unsubstantiated concepts regarding specific sections of algebra in order to expand the field of view of the student
This is of interest for further study of the subject
The teaching of mathematical disciplines is carried out at a modern pedagogical university mainly by standard transmission of the definitions of theorems and their argumentation with the conclusion of the report, which is only the study of the material by students and its application in exams
Therefore, in teaching mathematical disciplines, great attention should be paid to the creativity of students
When training future teachers when teaching abstract concepts of such an algebra (that is, field rings), it is necessary to give examples found in a school course
Students should understand that school algebra is not a separate subject, only in the university consider some elements of algebra
Education at the higher level of secondary school will be created in two directions: socio-humanitarian and natural-mathematical
One of the complex but necessary disciplines studied in grades 10 and 11 is the algebra and analysis initiative
The purpose of training is the qualitative mastery of the basic foundations of the initiative of algebra and analysis, aimed at achieving the necessary level of general intellectual development of the person based on national and universal human values, the formation of the practical foundations of logical abstraction and probabilistic thinking in their further effective training.
The acquired knowledge in studying this course is necessary for applicants entering universities in various areas, since mathematical analysis is included in the tasks of the UNT
Therefore, it is important for students not only to use known formulas to obtain products or calculate integrals, but also from the very beginning to learn how to use basic terms and formulas in mathematics and understand the importance of this section in life.
Mathematical analysis is the main course in the system of mathematical education of university students, in solving many problems of higher mathematics, methods and rules of study in this course are used
One of the fundamental methods in the study of variables on which the sections of courses are based, such as one and multiple-stage differential and integral computational function, is the theory of limits
Through functions, it is possible to formulate natural legislation not only in various production processes, but also in various areas of human activity the social laws of society (for example, the calculation of population growth)
The course of mathematical analysis is a difficult discipline for freshmen, since the ability to think means the desire for creativity and knowledge in professional activity
It is necessary to continue extensive and in-depth training in mathematical analysis courses at the university in analytical thinking obtained during the study of school analysis initiatives
However, based on the experience of working with freshmen, we see that the mathematical analysis of students with knowledge gained in school has differences between the initial requirements of further study
Mathematical analysis - a difficult discipline contains definitions of complex design that are hard to perceive by first-year students
Define a threshold, such as a derivative of the upper and lower limit, etc.
Students of the school perceive the function as a formula, when the growth of its argument leads to the properties of clarity of the function, a misunderstanding arises
The future teacher should understand the importance of the basics of mathematical analysis, explain and teach him
The school level is insufficient for further study in mathematics, since students do not understand the need to study in a more in-depth part, there is no motivation to study the subject of "higher mathematics"
If you do not understand the need to read a course of mathematical analysis, the efficiency of reading it decreases
That is, the issue of motivation is very important in training
Quantitative characteristics of mathematical models characterizing the relationship in various phenomena and processes are an integral part of research in any field of education
Their role is growing due to the ability to expand the processing of computer data
For example, the introduction of mathematics in various fields of activity will affect the use of mathematical knowledge in everyday practice
It not only use of simple mathematical calculations, but also probability theory of use of elements of the higher mathematics and analysis (for example, combination of codes of locking of stocks and numbers of share and share games and t
In everyday speech, we often hear phrases such as "the number of people with influenza is growing with geometric progression"
These examples show that mathematical education is a large-scale obligatory element of the general culture of modern man [3]
Mathematics, of course, is trained in calculations
The most important aspect of learning algebra and mathematical analysis is the application of theoretical knowledge in practice, that is, training in solving a report
The role and place of mathematics education remained unchanged
In the "Arithmetic" of Magnitsky (1703
) - solutions required for reports, meaning "confirmation"
The report was the goal of training, that is, taught mathematics to know the rules for solving typical problems
These reports were used mainly for applied purposes and then for purely practical purposes
The role of calculation due to the development of society as the goals of education change
changes
"Arithmetic calculations should be a teaching and methodological tool for teaching non-target arithmetic in conscious training
"
Currently, the role of reports in the field of mathematical education, on the one hand, is that the ultimate goal of this training is the methodology for solving a certain system of students.
On the other hand, full access to the goals of education is determined only using the solution of the student mathematical calculation system
Thus, solving problems in the teaching of mathematics will act as a goal and as a means of learning
The solution of complex reports is related to the introduction of methods and organizational forms of education by improving the content of the secondary school process
However, the issue of improving the content of mathematical education cannot be solved only by the scale of issues studied at school, that is, mathematics - a system of scientific knowledge about processes and phenomena on objects where basic laws and data theories are studied
It is necessary to transform the structure of school mathematical calculation systems aimed at optimizing and improving the efficiency of the educational process in accordance with the assessment of educational results and self-esteem to form methods of activity in education
The release of reports plays a crucial role in the course of algebra and mathematical analysis
The result of the training can be achieved using the acquired knowledge to publish practical reports
In this case, the release of reports is a tool and training goal
In the educational process, one of the most important elements of the educational activity of teaching mathematical disciplines to students and students is the maintenance of reports
This type of educational activity serves as a tool for the development and formation of thinking; promotes deep understanding of concepts in theories, creates conditions for the implementation of professional orientation
In the textbook for 10 classes of the natural and mathematical direction of the secondary school, depending on the applied calculations, the following tasks are given:

We must know and understand that the systematic study of mathematics is primarily important for the comprehensive development of the personality:
the ability to prove its conclusions;
the ability to determine the causes of phenomena and draw conclusions;
laconicism, that is, the ability to speak short and accurate thoughts;
creative thinking, the desire for a real generalization of research skills;
persistence in achieving its objectives [4]
Mathematics is in demand, starting with the existence of all mankind, because for success in modern society it is necessary to read mathematics in order to think correctly quickly, to focus on constantly changing modernity
Success in teaching mathematics depends to some extent on the order and number of reports to be provided to students
Therefore, when organizing the training process, the teacher who will execute the reports in the process of solving them will first of all have to select mathematical reports and organize them.
Requires the classification of reports that assist the teacher in implementing the selection of reports according to the didactic goal
A good pedagogical education is necessary for everyone, because in order to work in a team, in order to educate and educate our children, each of us needs to master the issues of psychological pedagogy
Teaches logical thinking to draw conclusions for the analysis of accurate mathematical disciplines
In the education system of the country, with the application of various approaches to learning, undertaken to achieve world level, the deep-sea search engine is the formation of a person who is able to show his worth with a fully developed ability to actively creative orientation for all actions.

On the basis of the theory of centralization of limit calculations at the free boundary, filtration of two incompressible liquids is described
We begin mathematical modeling at the microscopic level, that is, for incompressible liquids, indelible, with the stationary state of the Stokes viscosity system
The general boundary of the stationary Lamé equation of a solid frame in an incompressible dynamic medium, performed in a cavity space, is determined by the equation of motion in combination with the boundary conditions of the "solid frame in a sponge space" and for the density of an unknown liquid
Hence, we prove the presence of a solution to this model and strictly observe the homogenization procedure, therefore, when striving for zero, the dimensionless dimensions of the sponge body are geometrically periodic at this point in time
This proves that the Masket report has a solution for viscous dynamic filtering
Masket calculation - limit calculations at free borders; liquid filtration; homogenization of periodic structures; Darcy's Law

Theory of Object Management at the Present Stage
the current challenge is to implement new concepts and principles of management under uncertain conditions
Modern technical object management systems reflect a large number of parameters and relationships, such reports sometimes cannot be analytically solved and cannot always be detailed for conducting experiments
At the same time, most automatic control systems operate under parametric unknown conditions
However, these uncertainties do not allow the analysis and synthesis of such systems to create a single theory
These systems are only known to refer to finite intervals enclosed by specific targets

In this work, it is envisaged to determine the power of various blades of hydraulic power moment affecting the blades of reservoirs in which three blades are simultaneously under water under different conditions
At the same time, three blades of the suturbine under water in question are located under different conditions
At the same time, the reception of watercourse energy is different
The results of the study make it possible to determine how much of the power of the turbine blade was obtained with the full immersion of the blades in water, as well as their loss when entering and leaving the water
Rotation angles of turbine vortex power flow
For maximum reception of water flow energy, it is important to position the blades relative to water flow at full immersion in water [1]
In accordance with the structure of the hydraulic turbine, which we are considering, three blades are under water in different states, that is, they perceive the energy of the watercourse differently
In this regard, in this work, the moment and power of the hydraulic force of each blade submerged in the flow of water are examined.
This will make it possible to determine how much percent of the total capacity of tar rubin is taken when the blades are fully immersed in water.
And this will make it possible to accurately determine the losses when the blades get into the flow and exit
figure shows a hydrotubin with six flat and radial blades alternating in series and resulting in effluent (water pressure)
Axis of hydraulic turbine rotation coincides with head of Cartesian coordinates
Designations 123456 - serial number of hydraulic turbine blades P - radius of main cylindrical support (disk) of hydraulic turbine on which blades are attached
Other parameters are specified in hydraulic turbine diagram [2]
At full immersion one should determine moment of melting of force on liquid flow of hydraulic turbine blade wheel using formulae (4) [2]

We define the first integral from equation (4) using the relations (2) and (3):
Figure 1-

Next, we define the second integral using formulae (1) and (2) taking into account the ratio  u r1:
As mentioned above, during operation of the hydraulic turbine, three blades replacing the same trace in the liquid stream can be arranged according to the following scheme:
rotor rotation angle value
if the first blade is present
the second replaces the third
The sixth blade instead of the first blade leaves the current
Therefore, the hydraulic force and power of the turbine during full immersion of the blades should be determined separately for each blade

moment of force of interaction with flow is zero
With further circular movement of the turbine, the orientation of the third blade changes in the opposite direction, that is, the moment of force of the third blade is negative
At full immersion the interval of turbine rotation angle change is equal to:
Rotation Angle
in full immersion in the interval

Moment of hydraulic force of the sixth blade in this state:
Similarly, it is possible to determine the interchangeability and hydraulic power moments of one when fully immersed in the liquid flow of the other turbine blades
The power of each hydraulic turbine blade at full immersion is determined by the following equation:
Liquid hydrotubin with flow energy factor of liquid

The dependence of nyң coefficient on ғa is given
The number of lines in the graph coincides with the numbers of the blades, and the 4th line shows the dependence of the nyң coefficient on the ғa
It can be seen from the graph that the maximum values of the use of liquid flow energy are different for each blade, which is related to the arrangement of the blades
Maximum value of application of liquid flow energy corresponds to second position of blade

The article provides for the formation of a scientific cognitive approach of students when working with schedules
The description of the physical phenomenon through graphs makes the contradiction clear
Improves the dialectical thinking of students and correctly shapes their scientific cognitive approach
The application of graphs in physics lessons and physical research easily explains the contradictions that arise in the study of physical phenomena
Identifying unknown aspects of the phenomenon will help reveal new patterns, and sometimes will be the only way to identify previously unknown objects
Graphical analytical phenomenon dialectical thinking scientific approach
One of the most important parts of scientific thinking is dialectical logic
That is, physical thinking should also be dialectical
Do not forget about this when shaping the skills of students
When considering physical questions opposite to each other, formal logic forces you to choose only one of the two answers
And dialectical logic leads to the fact that under certain circumstances both contradictory statements can be correct, and sometimes both are incorrect
The description of the physical phenomenon through graphs makes the contradiction clear
Consider one example where the study of one phenomenon produces opposite results
Examine the dependence of heat generated on its resistance at the same time along the conductor
The first student writes the expression Q = I2 R t, indicating that the heat-resistance bond released from the conductor is a straight line in the rectangular coordinate system Q and R (Figure 1a).
In his opinion, the amount of heat is directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor
The second student writes the expression Q = U2 t/R, indicating that the heat-resistance bond released from the conductor may be hyperbole in the rectangular coordinate system Q and R (Figure 1a).
In his opinion, the amount of heat is inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor
The third student writes the expression Q = I U t, indicating that the heat released from the conductor depends on the resistance [1]
Figure 1-
Heat Barrier Dependencies
Who's right? If we carefully consider the situation under consideration, then if certain conditions are met, we will make sure that everything that the three students say is correct
The physical meaning of the law of Joule-Lenz defines an expression written only by the first student
The two remaining expressions taking into account R = U/I are independent conditions of the first expression
Since each of the three expressions determining the amount of heat includes only two values ​ ​ of R U and I, the selection of one corresponding coolant is effective with a constant one of them
For example, when connecting wires, the current is stable, so the amount of heat is directly proportional to the resistance
In this case, the amount of heat is conveniently calculated using the expression Q = I2 R t
When the conductors are connected in parallel, the voltage will be constant and will be proportional to the thermal barrier released from each of them
Because at the same voltage, the amount of heat will depend on the current strength, and the current resistance will be greater on the small conductor
At the same time, the amount of heat is conveniently calculated using the expression Q = U2 t/R
Such cases can be conducted and analyzed on many topics of physics
Examine the dependence of the traction force on the radius of the circle that affects it when the body moves in a circle
First Apprentice

In his opinion, the traction force in the center is inversely proportional to the radius
Second student

That is, the thrust to the center is directly proportional to the radius
Figure 2
Radio-resistant relations of thrust to center
Third disciple speaks of independence [2]
radius of centering force with expression record
Who's right? We are in the same situation as in the previous report
In preparing such reports and analyzing the graphs characterizing the phenomena, students learn the truth and are convinced that at the same time there can be different, even opposite points of view on the same question.
Predicts new previously unknown properties of a physical object
Consider the phenomenon of the photo effect that discovered Hertz
Lenard and Stoletov studied this phenomenon in detail and created hundreds of graphs, the results of which were formulated through 3 laws of the photo effect
They could not explain the phenomenon of the photo effect
Einstein explained the phenomenon of the photo effect by analyzing the contradictions in the plots of Lenard and Stoletov
Consider the most important of these graphs (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Dependence of kinetic energy of photoelectrons on light frequency
The graph of the dependence of the kinetic energy of photoelectrons in Einstein figure 3 on the frequency of light is the law of the photoelectric effect using the Planck equation and the law of energy conservation:
got the equation
This graph also determines the red boundary of the photoeffect and the operation of electrons to escape from the metal [3]
The most important result is the quantum properties of light observed in the phenomenon of the photo effect
Lenard and Stoletov could not explain the phenomenon of the photo effect: they could not go beyond classical electrodynamics, treating light only as a wave
A wave view of the nature of light cannot explain the graph in Figure 3
Analysis of graphs contrary to the established approach contributes to the formation of a deep correct approach to the functional relationship of physical quantities, which is a quantitative characteristic of the mobility of student thoughts and various physical phenomena
Consideration of phenomena leading to a contradictory result forms in students such qualities as critical thinking, which can change when making reasoned arguments.
Many patterns of physics are obtained during the analysis of graphs obtained in practice
For example, in 1785, Sh.
Interaction of point charges opening the pendant
Law:
consider the expression
He discovered this law by measuring the force of action of the charges themselves using circular scales
His concept: Two point charges located in a vacuum are directly proportional to the multiplication of these charges, and interact with a force proportional to the square of the distance
If we repeat the experience of the pendant, we get a set of points connecting force and distance (Figure 4)
Figure 4
Remote dependence of forces
These points are located around some even curve (dashed roll)
We cannot get a specific type of functional relationship between force and distance from this curve

Only using the graphs of analysis of the data obtained in practice can we make sure that the Coulomb law is correct
The elementary parts discovered in the 60s of the XX century, called resonances, were also discovered during the analysis of graphs
Resonances split as a result of strong interaction
Their lifetime is 10-22 − 10-24 s
Direct control over their tracks is impossible due to the brevity of life time and paths
Resonances are reflected in the form of maxima depending on the energy of the full section
For the first time, resonances were observed during the interaction of pi-mesons and nucleons (Figure 6) [4]
Mass A of energy corresponding to the maximum cross section A = E0 0 corresponds to resonance m = E0/c2
The main reason why the particle is called resonant is that the graph of the interaction cross section versus kinetic energy is similar to the resonant curve
Figure 6
- dependence of full cross section of meson and nucleon interaction on kinetic energy
Resonances have clear quantum characteristics, such as electric mass charge, spin isospin
Effective method of resonance control: analysis of graphs of energy and particle pulses arising during resonance decomposition
The presence of resonances indicates the complexity of the construction of nucleons
The study of resonances will make it possible to understand the dynamics of the interaction of quarks and gluons in hadrons
In general, the application of graphs in physics and physical research classes:
physical	phenomena	in the study	arising	contradictions	easily explains;
facilitates easy assignment of a link between physical quantities;
phenomenon	it is unknown	parties	definitely	new	legality	helps to uncover;
sometimes there is the only way to identify objects that were previously unknown
The widespread use of graphs in physics classes improves the ability of graduates to think critically and forms scientific views

Scientific article provides for the theory of phase transformations
The main features of phase transformations of the first kind are called thermal effects with indication of theoretical methods of their description in connection with transportation processes
In phase transformations of the second kind, cases of side thermal effects are also provided
The physical reasons for these effects are explained by the effect on the transport processes of jumping changes in the coefficients of volumetric thermal increase (β) and compression (α) occurring during phase transformations of the second kind
Thermal effects of phase transformations specific thermal capacitance
In nature, phenomena called phase transitions (transformations) are widely developed in technology and technology.
Therefore, a comprehensive study of these processes is of great scientific and practical importance
From today's scientific point of view, these processes are divided by their peculiarities into two groups under phase transformations of the first and second origin [12]
It is known that any phase transformation occurs with a hopping change in certain values ​ ​ characterizing the properties of the substance
As a rule, during phase transformations of the first kind, the specific volume of the substance changes, and therefore they occur with the absorption or release of a certain heat
A striking example of phase transformations of the first kind is the processes associated with changing the aggregate states of substances (solid liquid gas)
It is known that phase transformations of the first kind can be characterized by the Clapeiron-Clausius equation, formulated as a consequence of the second thermodynamics initiative
The main features of phase transformations of the second kind - during which there is no change in intrinsic volume and no absorption or release of heat
But with phase transformations of the second kind, thermal coefficients of thermal increase in thermal imaging of substances
It is known that hopping values ​ ​ change
An example of phase transformations of the second kind is the transition of iron from nickel cobalt or some magnetic impurities to paramagnetic
These switches are performed by heating the materials at certain temperature values called Curie point
In the case of phase transformations of the second kind, the Clapeiron-Clausius equation loses its value, and the Ehrenfest relations are currently used to a certain extent in the description of these processes.
Now, if you briefly formulate thermodynamically these words
During transformations, the eigenthemodynamic potential (TP) is continuously preserved and, as a rule, the continuity of its derivatives is disturbed
In phase transformations of the first kind a of this function (TP), the first product is changed by a jump
And in phase transformations of the second kind, its first product remains continuous, only the second product undergoes hopping changes
First and second phase transformations
here is also one of the generic names
In this regard, you can write the following expressions [1]:
Thus, phase transformations of the first kind are characterized by hopping changes in specific entropy (c) and intrinsic volume (c)
And with these changes, you can determine the heat of your own phase transformation (q) so
With phase transformations of the second kind (1), the values ​ ​ c and c in the expression remain continuous, that is, the thermal effects in these processes do not take place
With such phase transitions, the second product of its own thermodynamic potential breaks:
From these expressions, it can be seen that phase transformations of the second kind are associated with jumping changes in the following values ​ ​ (parameters):
Specific heat capacity - sr;
Coefficient of volumetric thermal increase
Isothermal compression ratio of substance (sample)
It should be noted that today the theory of secondary transitions, unlike phase transformations of the first kind, is not yet fully formed from a scientific point of view.
In this regard, we have decided to draw a number of conclusions on these phenomena, based on the results of the research work to date [3-6] below.
Thus, from a scientific point of view today, phase transformations of the first kind are not associated with such phenomena if heat absorption or distribution occurs in connection with thermal effects (endothermic or exothermic).
However, with phase transformations of the second kind, significant changes in the aforementioned thermodynamic coefficients of the substance (system) (sr β α) can lead to side thermal effects
This can be seen well when we consider this in connection with phase transformation transport processes
Consider the question first in connection with phase transitions of the first kind
We argue that when simultaneously heated along one body (sample or system), heat transportation takes place at the frequency of four processes with different nature, such as primary phase conversion (heat efficient) diffusion mass and thermal increase (or precipitate)
Then, in accordance with the principles of Onzager's theory, which form the basis of thermodynamics of irreversible processes, we can write the following equation with respect to floating heat flux [7-9]
where L - kinetic coefficients (characterizing the medium throughput under consideration) X - thermodynamic (driving) forces
The first term on the right of the equation (6) describes heat flows relative to the main force, and the third to the second-phase transformation characterizes additional flows related to the diffusion of the fourth thermal increase (deformation)
Such equations can be written for each of the listed streams (q2q3q4)
The results of a comprehensive study of complex transport processes in polyphase systems [3-6] showed that the effect of additional thermodynamic forces (flows) in the system (body) on the main flow (for example, heat flow) can be described through thermodynamic coefficients and effective values ​ ​ of forces (Lef Hef) X2X3X4
In fact, it is known that in such complex transport processes, the experimenter can determine effective potential values, that is, potential fields (for example, temperature), taking into account the influence of other processes occurring in the layer, in accordance with this effective values ​ ​ of thermodynamic coefficients (for example, temperature-aef)
If irreversible processes did not initially occur during the reheating of the system in question, that is, there was only one process (q = L1X1), then it would be possible to evaluate the effective value of additional processes that will overlap through the following expressions.
Now let's try to use the above theoretical questions for a specific case, for example, for the process of heating line
First, consider a stationary situation
It is known that the Fourier equation can be used to describe a system (body) if only the heat flow process occurs on it
A few processes (diffusion phase transformations t
(7) the equation according to equation (10) can be written using effective values
Effect on heat fluxes of other phenomena occurring in layers (8) and
can be defined according to equations
It	to conditions	it agrees	hospital	no	processes	for	so	You can write [3-9]:
or a	
Considering that (13) can be written as follows:
This also results in other processes (thermal diffusion effects t) occurring in the layer using equations (14) to (16) given by (12) (13) as above.
) effect on transient heat flow
Now let's consider these words in relation to secondary phase transformations
It should not be disputed that significant changes in the thermodynamic coefficients of the substance (system) (with βα) under these phenomena lead to additional side thermal effects as a result of this, contributing to changes in the thermodynamic forces (potential fields) related to transportation, corresponding to changes in flow values ​ ​ (for example, heat flow)
It cannot be said that with phase transformations of the second kind, no thermal effect occurs
A significant change in the specific heat capacity of a substance (system) on one side during phase transformations of the second kind, other thermodynamic
changes in coefficients (aef 
Also
from the above data, it is clear that the change of the parameters β and α along with the indicated coefficients during phase transformations of the second kind also leads to the occurrence of additional side thermal effects
The effect of such thermal effects in phase transformations of the second kind on transport processes can also be described by the above theoretical results.

Wavelet Converter-Technology Basis Haar Wavelet- Digital Video Parallel Computing
Currently, with the development of the Internet of digital communication tools for color printers of graphic monitors of computer equipment, digital images have been widely introduced, associated with the promotion of digital camera processing technology with the widespread distribution of powerful computers
receives a significant amount of memory during storage due to transmission in the form of a large number of bits, and also has a lower rate when sending
Therefore, pressing out the video was necessary
Hence the steady development of interest in image compression [1 55b]
Image compression is the application of a data compression algorithm to a digital stored image
As a result of compression, the size of the image is reduced, accordingly, the time of its direction is reduced, and the amount of memory necessary for storing the image is also saved.
There are two types of image compression, video is completely restored and not restored [1 22b]
The file format of many images uses the first type, and each bit of the obtained image corresponds to the original image when re-restoring the compressed image using this technology
However, its compression ratio is very small, it is used on television in aerial photographs in medicine
And the image compressed by the second type completely does not correspond to the original image, but when compressing images that can be several hundred times higher than its compression ratio, this method is often used
According to many studies, the visual ability of a person cannot clearly notice some visual details, so the disappearance or change of these particles does not significantly appear to human members of vision
The relevance of the topic, as noted above, is determined by the need for most memory while preserving the images that make up most of the information fund in the world
In solving this problem, there is a need to compress the image, and one of the compression technologies is the method of wavelets relatively new and effective in some cases
The scientific innovation of the work lies in the presentation of the method of wavelet-squeezing, which is currently used in the compression of a digital image
The theoretical and practical importance of the work lies in the totality of a number of theoretical information, in which the fundamentals of the wavelet-squeeze method in the work are fully studied; their use as additional material in further research on image processing; in the application of a program based on theoretical foundations of work, as an effective version of image compression algorithms
The purpose of the work is to provide a method based on the wavelet transformation of the image compression algorithm, caused by the need to save time and resources during image compression.
When achieving the goal, the following tasks are set:
Study of methods and algorithms for image processing;
Creating a program without a sequential algorithm that performs a method of wavelet compression of an image in grayscale;
Analysis of quantitative results from created programs
Prospects for further development of the work
Implementation of a parallel algorithm for the efficiency of the image compression algorithm caused by the need to save time and resources during image compression
Description of the resolution progress of the image compression report
The basis of the computer world is a number, that is, any type of information must be represented as a set of quantitative values ​ ​ in which the computing device can work
Images are also subject to this principle
Image image has two paths: in the form of dot (raster) and vector graphics
The first uses an array of numbers characterizing the color parameters of each point, and the second calculates all image points from new values ​ ​ obtained using the mathematical formula [1 69b]
All bitmap images consist of very small elements, characterized by the location on the bitmap (bitmap) and color parameters
These elements are called pixels (pixel - picture), pixels are closely related
The size of the video (size) is set by the horizontal (width) and vertical (height) number of pixels
Thus, the width and length of any selected image (width) (height) give the corresponding number of columns and rows of the array obtained from the image as digital data [2 112 b]
The image of the video pixels is shown in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1
Display bitmap images
The basis for the work is gray BMP images
In this case, each pixel of the image is encoded with 8 bits
The color depth of the image of the given form is 8 bits, and each pixel of it can take 256 different values
These values are 256 gray colors
Therefore, the array elements in the program are positive numbers from [0 to 255]
Figure 2 shows 256 gray colors

Image compression is the application of a data compression algorithm to a digital stored image
As a result of compression, the size of the image is reduced, accordingly, the time of its direction is reduced, and the amount of memory necessary for storing the image is also saved.

The elements of the array in which the video pixel value is stored are positive integers, so in case of a negative divergence of the values ​ ​ of the two neighboring pixels, use the average pixel value to convert it to the right [4 53b]
Two-dimensional Haar transformations are the composition of one-dimensional Haar transformations
Transmit 2-D input with C matrix
Using one-dimensional Haar transformations, two new matrices appear on each row of the matrix S, consisting of nerve and disassembled parts of the paths of the original matrix
As a result of applying one-dimensional Haar transformations to each column of correspondingly taken matrices, four matrices are obtained, consisting of three vertical horizontal and diagonal detecting components, one of which remains from nerve-forming components
This process is repeated to the next level, as the initial matrix, has a matrix obtained at the previous level as a nerve-forming component [5 96b]
In order to carry out the inverse wavelet transformation, it is necessary to provide ~ A two-dimensional synthesis array
Inverse transformations by analogy with the principle of direct transformation operation are first encoded
for each row of the matrix then for each column
So, the solution of the report of compression of the image, based on wave- transformations, is carried out in C # and its results in the figures below (3 4-gray)
)
In summary, the Wavelets and ideas based on them have made invaluable contributions to the theory and practice of image processing, and it is not surprising that in the near future they will become the main focus in this field.
Even now, the uvet transformations replace the usual Fourier transformations in solving various problems
This is applied in many areas, including computer graphics and DNA analysis processing for image compression, general signal processing, data compression, and language recognition [6 86 b]

Electrocardiogram (ECG) QRS complex zero crossing
Introduction
Measures to automate modern medical devices are being studied and improved
If possible, automation is also carried out with the connection of medical devices to the computer
One such electrocardiograph system
The functions of the heart in the human body produce electrical pulses controlled by its own rhythm and direct it to the receiver (1)
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a graphic image of electrical pulses during heart operation
It is very important to identify and remove obstacles to getting a correct diagnosis of the disease by analyzing the electrocardiogram
The production of electrocardiograms depends on the amplified channels of the electrocardiograph
Electrocardiogram consists of cloves and partitions
P Q R C T is disconnected by teeth
Algebraic sum of electrototations in the flash of the right and left cores of P-teeth
Q R S teeth reflect initiation of ventricular excitation, and T - repolarization process
To analyze the QRS complex, we need an algorithm that determines the QRS complex from other parts of the ECG
Pan-Tompkins algorithm and t, based on the product of an algorithm that has one algorithm value to determine the QRS complex
To determine the QRS complex in the electrocardiographic system, an algorithm based on the number of zero intersections was obtained
Because the sensitivity and specificity index of the algorithm is higher than others and can optimally determine the QRS complex from balls in the ECG
Currently, there are various models for interpreting electrocardiographs
Some of these models unfortunately make mistakes
Therefore, a comprehensive study of the algorithms of these models is required.
Zero Crossing Algorithm
The article presents the method of determination of QRS-complex by means of electrocardiographic signals, based on calculation of zero section in ECG segments [2]
This will allow very noisy electrocardiographic signals to be detected at a high level
Also effectively solves the problems identified in determining QRS number of zero transitions
To reduce the average P and T wave according to spectral characteristics in the ECG components, it is necessary to filter the high frequency noise in the ECG signals
A band filter with linear phase is used, since the filtered signal is applied to the time isolated wave R
As we see in Figure 1, the algorithm consists of three steps: signal detection and time isolation of the R-wave [3]
Result
Figure 1
Algorithm Steps
Signal detection consists of amplitude estimation of nonlinear band conversion from filter application and includes switching on of high-frequency circuits in calculations of search and crossing of zero transition
The signal passed the filter swings around zero, and also has a high amplitude in the complex of QRS complexes, and in other intervals its amplitude decreases
If you connect to a signal that has passed a high frequency system filter, then outside the QRS segment you can get a signal with zero intersection of a plurality of signals and a QRS complex with only a small zero intersection
The high frequency circuit is calculated as follows:
where 𝐾 (𝑛) is the amplitude that changes over time
Signal correction comes from non-linear signal conversion
𝑦(𝑛) = 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑥𝑓(𝑛)) 𝑥𝑓2 (𝑛) 	(2) where 𝑥𝑓 (𝑛) is a filtered signal and 𝑦 (𝑛) is a non-linearly modified signal
Signal () is used to determine time location of wave R
Connection and amplitude price of high-frequency circuit: field filter
due to application to signal ()
It is necessary to include in the corresponding high-frequency chain signal:
Thus, we increase the number of zero intersections outside the QRS segment
Determination () [2] is performed by formula:
𝐾 (𝑛) = 𝜆𝐾 𝐾 (𝑛 − 1) + (1 − 𝜆𝐾 ) | 𝑦(𝑛) | 𝑐 	(4) Where [Beta] ∈ (0; 1) - correction factor and parameter c means constant amplifier, for example c = 4
Zero intersection detection and calculation:
Number of zero intersections in segment:
detection of an event is carried out with use of value Θ a high-rise limit:
Θ(𝑛) = 𝜆ΘΘ(𝑛 − 1) + (1 − 𝜆Θ)𝐷(𝑛)			(7) where [theta] [theta] ∈ (0; 1) indicates the abandonment factor
In order to detect the event, the limit value [theta] (n) is compared with the signal D (n).
Only D (n) defines the event

Results of the algorithm study
For the study of the method [4], actual ECG signals were obtained using real means (Figure 2)
These signals are ideal for validating the algorithm
Analysis of the application of the corresponding method was carried out with real ECG indicators
The value obtained from the input signals was tested on the zero number algorithm
Figure 2
Tested ECG Values
We use two parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm - we measure the sensitivity and specificity of the result in the following way:
sensitivity =	𝑇𝑃
∗ 100%	exception =	𝑇𝑃
where TP - quantity of correctly revealed FN - the number of false fluctuations and FP - quantity false revealed
Table 1 shows the calculated result of the algorithm
The sensitivity of the algorithm is 9970% (277 Fns) and specificity 9957% (390 FPs)
Maximum of false results in 207 records
This entry, in particular, is not one complex problem for the algorithm
For most noisy records, for example, in 108 records, the algorithm is not too ideal, but there are also good results
In some calculations, the last wave R is also detected in the last records, for example, in 100 records
Sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm
Of course, these characteristics give better and better definitions than other computed algorithms [3]
The sensitivity in the results raised in the table depends on the high frequency circuit b (n) in amplitude K (n)
Thus, this amplitude is easily controlled using the algorithm
Conclusion
Calculation at selection of QRS complex determination algorithm
It is necessary to provide for complexity implementation complexity and how well the algorithm is able to noise the QRS complex
The study analyzed the algorithm of correct and accurate determination of knees, based on the zero interval
Algorithm is more efficient than other computational methods
Because in simple ways it was possible to determine the QRS complex in less time

Act - al-Farabi competence mathematical legacy extracurricular work information competence
The walk "Aristotle of the East" at one time Abu Nasyr Al Farabi is an outstanding historical person who brought knowledge to our people
Farabi speaks several languages ​ ​ and wrote more than a hundred valuable works
His treatises on the philosophy of mathematics to socio-economic issues are still valuable for their scientific significance
He formulated that based on the application of mathematics, it is possible to write the secrets of natural phenomena
His mathematical treatises are the basis of mathematical teaching at present [1]
At the same time, popularizing the mathematical heritage of Farabi, one of the founders of science, who has made a huge contribution to the development of science as a whole, requires the training of students
This reminds students that their ancestors are very educated in world science.
Studying the heritage of ancestors educates the younger generation with patriotism and increases respect for the heritage of ancestors for young people
Reporting to students that they still have a lot of unexplored heritage will contribute to the development of their abilities to increase interest in science
And Farabi in the mathematical legacy of our grandfather in the "Supplement to Almagest" ("Almagest" b
the work of Ptolomew the great astronomer of the Greek).
writing
creating a division of figures without a linear data compass into several, detecting the value of sin1 ° [23] in calculations of geometric construction - as an overlay of an angle trisection
The output of reports will inevitably arouse interest in mathematics among the student
These data are not mentioned in school textbooks in the school curriculum
Now questions arise about the purpose for which we will study such data at any time
One way to solve this problem is to study at extracurricular work events
Currently, one of the relevant topics has been the formation of the competence of the individual in society as a whole, including in the field of education
The concept of competence arose as a result of drawing special attention to the subjective experience of the individual in the field of pedagogy
Competence Direct translation of the word "competens" into Latin
This means that it can be fully informed about a particular industry and make authoritative decisions on any issues [4]
Scientists classify competencies into several key competencies
Most common A
Khutor's classification is distinguished by the following competencies: general cultural; educational and educational; information; communicative; social and labor; competence of personality self-realization
Information competence - use of specific objects (television tape telephone computer, etc.
) and information technology (Internet audio-video program e-mail, etc.
) unauthorized detection of information by means of information selection and analysis with preservation and transfer of transformations
Many authors explain the term "information competence" by the fact that the choice of an individual to independently search for certain information is an opportunity to organize analysis and transportation opportunities
For example, O
Smolyaninova considers information competence as universal approaches to systematizing the synthesis and transformation of information into knowledge with the provision of search processing and transportation of information
We call student competence a quality indicator of a result-oriented education system
We understand that competence in order for students to effectively use not only knowledge, but also knowledge in the process taking place in practice, to achieve an effective result, and information and communication competence is the ability to comprehensively apply the capabilities of information and communication technologies in solving problems of educational and professional orientation
At the same time, Farabi called the mathematical legacy of our ancestor ICT competence of schoolchildren	formation	for purposes of	can be trained at informatics events
Because, firstly, in order for a child to collect information in search - this must be new information, secondly, due to the high availability of the modern network in the network, there should not be a clear answer, thirdly, to achieve a result in his mathematics
uses the acquired knowledge of the subjects to obtain results
It is known that at the time when it is said about the formation of ICT competencies in extracurricular work, classes in informatics and mathematics occupy a special place [5]
Consider how to organize a learning process in computer science lessons using Farabi's mathematical legacy to find a place for each competency
A lot of extracurricular work
Taking into account the interest of schoolchildren, diversity can be organized
In a secondary school they study the programming language from the 7th grade and can draw up a program and keep records in the 8th grade
However, the standard
one hour per week will be less programming language training
To solve this problem, additional extracurricular work with the programming language must be organized
Such work can be organized to further develop the knowledge gained in the programming language, as well as create a program to solve Farabi's problems
For example, from the eighth book of Al-Farabi
Take the "On Squares Allocation" report [3]
[I] If he says how to divide the flat shape of ABCD into two equal lines passing through one of the corners, then we get the angle A and lead the lines AC and BD intersecting at the point E
If the BE line is equal to the ED line, the AC line allocates the ABCD shape
Here is his picture [Figure 1]
Figure 1
Selected Flat Shape
Create a program to provide this report to students in extracurricular computer science
Firstly, draw using the graphical capabilities of the programming language
Secondly, it resembles the formula of detecting the distance between two points on the coordinate plane to verify that the BE line is equal to the ED line (Figure 2)
The area of ​ ​ the formed triangles CBA and ACD, including the opposite ceilings, is detected according to the Geron formula
To do this, first find the length of each triangle wall
ACD triangle wall lengths:
drawing
Formula for finding the distance between two points in the coordinate plane
CBA triangle wall lengths:

ACD triangle area:
CBA triangle area:
Compares the area of two triangles after the area is detected
If the area of both triangles is equal to the area, you can divide the flat ABCD shape into two lines passing through one of its corners
if S1 = S2 then Writeln; end
Given that information and communication competence is the ability to fully utilize the capabilities of information and communication technologies in solving educational and professional tasks, such work will contribute to the development of information and communication competencies of students
As a result, we see that when issuing such a report in extracurricular work, students find the solution to problems by creating a program with the addition of knowledge in other subjects.
This will help shape the competence of ICT learners
The history of science and mathematics will also be known
Thus, competencies are formed for obtaining new information using ICT tools and using ICT tools in their daily services

Training Principle Quality Training Criteria for Visual Programming of Multi-Criterion Evaluation of Training Results Program Codes
The application of multi-criterion evaluation in the process of monitoring and evaluation of training results consists of the following stages: daily (current) intermediate (intermediate) and final control [1]
Student performance monitoring - systematic verification of students' knowledge of the professional curriculum in auditing and out-of-competition classes in accordance with the schedule during the academic period is carried out by the teacher [1]
With the current control, students' educational achievements are evaluated on a 100-point scale for each task completed (the student's independent work to take back homework in current classes)
Visual programming knowledge is monitored at the following stages:
creation of a program code (C1) in accordance with the labor assignment is rated each student on a 100-point scale for the ability to use regulatory documents that determine requirements for the compilation of sheets of information resources for the level of proficiency in the language of distinguishing sheets;
optimization (C2) of the program code is put in a subgroup on a 100-point scale for substantiating the choice of methods for improving the readability of the program code for the use of special software funds;
arrangement (C3) of program code in client part of information resource is evaluated by subgroup on 100-point scale for displaying information resource in measurements of working area of devices;
placement of program code in the server part of the information resource (C4) is evaluated by a subgroup on a 100-point scale to display elements of the information resource in various browsers
At all stages, students should demonstrate the application of knowledge on the basics of modern database management systems of the system areas of web-technologies, which will provide an interdisciplinary link of learning
Assessment of performance monitoring shall be not less than 50% of admission rating
The individuality of knowledge control planning allows you to take into account the individual abilities of students with professional experience and professional knowledge in a specific situation [2]
Objectivity of control prevents subjective and erroneous statements that reduce the educational significance of control, which do not reflect the real performance of students
The objectivity of knowledge control depends on many factors
These include the definition of general and specific training goals, the organization of monitoring with the provision of methods of analysis and evaluation of the processing of control results, the justification for the selection and selection of objects and the content of control
Quality and objectivity of control depend on the solution of these issues
Intermediate certification of trainees - an event conducted to assess the quality of mastering part of the content of a certain educational discipline or the entire volume after graduation
Intermediate certification of students is carried out in the form of exams and differential tests
Examinations are a form of testing the educational achievements of students in the professional curriculum of the discipline, the purpose of which is to evaluate educational achievements by academic period
Students who have not received a positive rating for a given discipline are not allowed to final control (exam)
Visual programming exams shall take into account training results
To determine the level of competence of students in the field of visual programming, it is necessary to determine the level of competence formation
To determine the level of generation, since the programming process is a complex process, Blum
use my taxonomy [3]:
The level "Knowledge" is familiar with the basic concepts of the student and the terms of visual programming with the rules and principles of visual programming (for example, C++)
Understanding - the student knows the modeling of phenomena that apply design concepts in typical calculations and can analyze the shortcomings of additional design, improve simple programs and algorithms according to standard rules, reproduce the algorithm (program) according to a given template
Application (AP) - the use of known algorithms in given programming conditions and new conditions for the use of programming methods using known algorithms for working with forms in new conditions
Analysis (AS) - the ability of an object to correctly distribute a report to auxiliary reports to determine the structure of the process and understand the principles of organizing a whole qualification that distinguishes the relationship between them from the membership of parts of the whole in the object of scientific research and the information system; ability to identify errors and gaps in the decision logic of the information report to assess the importance of the visual programming tools provided to solve the report
Synthesis (C) - ability to plan changes in conditions in problematic non-standard conditions arising during visual programming
Evaluation (E) - determination of the model of decision of the information report taking into account the own experience and experience of experts based on comparison of specific and planned work on the project implementation and ability to adjust it at the level of change of the project goals, ability to manage information systems of strategic thinking
The principle of strength of knowledge ownership requires that the content of training is kept in the minds of students for a long time, which is the basis of their order
This result can be achieved only if the trainees organize a systematic repetition of the material with the manifestation of cognitive activity, provided that the results of the training of their measurement are systematically monitored.
Graduates of IT specialties do not pass the individual state exam in visual programming
Attention should be paid to the following characteristics of the practical task performed in the process of evaluation of knowledge on programming: the ability to use different libraries and platforms to know the properties and conditions corresponding to the visual components [4]
We suggest teaching students visual programming using Problem Based Learning PBL
The purpose of the method is to teach students to independently find a solution to professional problems
The teacher raises a question to the group and gives them freedom, limited by the role of an active observer
Where students take and how they decide what information is needed to complete the task
As a basis, we obtained PBL application at Steden University, where working with the group involves solving the report in 7 steps:
study of problem theory in the multimedia library of the university and textbooks on the Internet
step: determining the source of the question and the expected result
step: attacking the brain
Students will comprehensively consider the issue and exchange ideas on its solution
Create a list of solution options for the visual presentation report
Step 5, Process List by Self-Service Group
distribution of topics
Individual review of guidance for decision in university library and internet among PBL lessons
exchange of information and choice of optimal solution
In this lesson, students will receive a new task and go to 1 step
Conclusion: each student discovers a new experience of professional issues, learns to work in a team and independently, which will help him prepare for a future career
In the first classes, students will get acquainted with the list of the main modules considered in visual programming training
Syllabus describes some management principles for the practical implementation of various training methods
Each training module consists of various events: lectures, seminars, laboratories and the implementation of mini-projects
To achieve the goals of the course, students need to use the knowledge obtained from lectures and laboratory methods in practice
The training activities presented include:
Lectures: The teacher explains the main ideas of the content of lectures, and students will independently propose some issues in which additional solutions will be developed
Mainly lectures are given through presentation, during the lecture questions are asked to individual students and subgroups
At the end of the lecture, each subgroup will create its own intellectual map
Laboratory classes: produce experimental reports presented during lectures to students
Students work with the team ideally 2 students
The teacher makes some instructions
Laboratory work is evaluated as follows: each student or team offers their own methods to solve the problem of laboratory work
Other groups of students and medics analyze and recommend them
Seminars: opinions of student teams (ideally of 4 students) on solving the problem with the help of PBL
Mini project will be created by a team of 4 students
Weekly mini-project will go gradually
Students themselves draw up a project schedule and are responsible for the timely execution of the project
Each training event is characterized by qualification and expected outcome with basic knowledge, prerequisites
In the future, new knowledge and information will be structured and incorporated into the knowledge base
Thus, each student will have a separate knowledge base on "Visual Programming"
The knowledge base was included in the student training program and became its mandatory element
Its training will allow you to work in a professional environment, determine their functional directions, receive additional information and advice necessary to better fulfill labor issues
Evaluation is a very important aspect of the learning process, as it allows you to determine the level of knowledge and qualifications of students
Assessment should include not only technical knowledge of the subject, but also assessment of the skills and competencies that students own [2]
Conduct negotiations on the coordination of their cognitive skills (evaluation of the application of analytical synthesis) and action skills (organization of time resources) in such assessment
) should be paid attention
Students dissatisfied with the process of assessing knowledge in various courses are most often dissatisfied with the fact that the assessment of students in training does not concentrate on real progress
Taking into account how students receive knowledge of qualifications and competencies, graduates should ensure that they receive appropriate opportunities
Based on the classification of means of organizing programming training in high school, we have identified means of generating specific visual programming knowledge [5]:
Specific means of learning (textbooks, teaching aids, didactic and visual materials);
ideal means of learning (knowledge and qualifications obtained before students used to absorb new educational material);
virtual learning tools (software tutorials that trigger virtual student activities)
Training should affect the results of each student in real time
This method will allow the student to get the right educational content at the right time and achieve the goals
By creating design work, students will have the opportunity to study the theoretical material in greater depth and to apply the results of theory in solving reports of an applied nature.
Developing the ability of a student to improve his/her professional knowledge in an information society To prepare for lifelong learning in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the learning process, we used information multimedia technologies
Multimedia Information Technology Philosophy:
interactive mode of operation;
communication with other software products;
flexibility in the process of modifying report data
Multimedia Technology Delivers Audio and Video with Animation
Multimedia information technologies will improve the quality of the material provided to maximize the customer's information needs
In this article, we talked about the methods and forms of organizing an educational process for teaching visual programming using a multi-criterion model for evaluating student educational achievements
The educational process, along with the learning process, includes the knowledge control process
Conducting monitoring in accordance with the principle of conflict between design and recursive principles ensures that students implement the principles of individual interethnic objectivity and strength with current and final certification, provides justification of criteria for quality training in visual programming in the organization of the educational process
These criteria are easily tested by the descriptivity of dimensionality at all stages of the decision-making process, a combination of defining and forming the principle of consciousness
The following table (Table 1) shows the system of provision of quality training in visual programming using multi-criterion evaluation of training results
Training	results	multi-criterion	assessment	for	Criteria for Quality Visual Programming Training
Determination of training results will allow to carry out multi-criterion assessment of educational achievements of students on virtual programming, based on interchangeability of program content to expected training results and forms of control, identification of interaction of taboo processes and control of quality training criteria

CSS HTML PHP SQL Darbin-Watson Variance Analysis Correlation Regression Analysis ROBOT - PARSER Urbanization Criterion
Urbanization will lead to an increase in the number of cities that influence the formation of society
The Incoming Global Historical Process
The process will be based on the structure of the country's demographic indicator, population migration, a change in the force of production, a change in culture and the formation of a new culture
Urbanization encompasses demographic, geographical, social and economic aspects
This article identifies the factors influencing the demographic process, on the basis of which the principles of the construction and operation of the information system, tested by the Darbin-Watson criterion, the quality of the regression equation, on the basis of which regression variance analyses were conducted, are described in detail.
Mathematical model of the urbanization process
Stages and implementation of multifactorial regression analysis:
Initial data preparation period
Table 1 shows quantitative results of 7 factors influencing the process of urbanization from 2005 to 2015 in the city of Almaty [1]
Table of performance indicators and factors
Definitions in the scorecard of performance indicators and factors:
n - number of observations (from 2005 to 2015);
Y - effective indicator (random dependent variable)
demographic indicator for the city of Almaty from 2005 to 2015;
X1 - the standard of living of the population in the city of Almaty tenge;
X2 is the percentage of unemployment;
X3 - consumer price index per cent;
X4 - number of registered patients by diagnosis per 1000 people;
X5 - indicator of housing availability per square person
X6 - freight turnover of all types of transport million
X7 - emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere of thousand tons
The period for determining the parameters of the equation using the least squares method
It
at the stage after determining the value of the effective indicator and the factors influencing this indicator, a regression equation is created
Model equation parameters are the most
determined by the small squares method
using the formula

The matrix with the variable Xj consists of values ​ ​ of factors that affect the process of urbanization, a column of one is added to the matrix with the variable Xj
Establishment of an information system for the urbanization process
The operation of the information system, created depending on the process of urbanization, is indicated in Figure 1
drawing
Information system operation diagram
Schema processing includes 4 methods
Information on factors affecting the urbanization of the processing of these factors consists of tabular data and diagrams
Regression processing is the main important part of the system
Because the urbanization process model is based on regression analysis
News processing is a necessary operation for forecasting
This data will be carried out using robot parser technology
The processing of forecast data and diagrams involves the construction of diagrams based on the forecast forecast based on the created model and the linear trend model
The database contains parsing innovations of statistics containing a set of data presented as a table of factors
With the help of robot parser technology, information related to factors will be removed from statistical sites
If there is an algorithm for obtaining information, first, keywords associated with factors are created, and parsing is carried out on the basis of these words.
Parsing data are applied to the prediction of coefficients that have been processed by the estimation coefficient
The architecture of the data processing technology of other sites is shown in Figure 2.
The Parsing architecture is the sending of data to the server using the JNDI application interface and the minimum WML data block using the HTTP protocol from other sites

Database Schema
The factors table in the database contains information on factors affecting the process of urbanization
The individual identification number of the factors of the table (id) contains in the table the name of the factors (title) the form of transmission (content) of the image (avatar) for positive parsing keywords (tags) negative keywords for parsing (tags1) attributes
The identification number (id) of the identification number (fid) of the factors consists of identification numbers (nid) and attributes of coefficients for parsing (coef)
Table news contains identification number (id) list of reference sites (source) of resource sequences (title) with reference to the site (link) and timestamp attributes (timestamp)
The current _ info table in the database contains information about factor coefficients
Table consists of attributes of individual identification number (fid) of demographic indicator (value) and years (year) of identified factors (id)
identification number (id) contains attributes of individual identification number (fid) of factors of demographic indicator (value) and time indicator (timestamp)
Information System Web Interface
The information system is a system that performs any logical approach from managing a set of information from communication with the database
Urbanization Process Model Information System Created in PHP Text Editor PhpStorm
The main page of the site contains information about factors and the main menu
The Forecast menu contains the main function of the information system
Regression correlation analysis is performed in this menu
Regression analysis and correlation analysis are calculated in the created information system (Figure 4)

Correlation analysis result
This menu summarizes the table by the important factors left by the first analysis
After the regression analysis, the last final equation is determined in the program
As a result of the analysis, the values ​ ​ of factors X1 and X5 are included in the regression equation, that is, the average monthly volumes compared to other factors and the factors of housing availability have an impact on demographic indicators
Final regression equation:
Since the parameters tb0 tb1 and tb > tk relative to this equation are statistically significant, excluding the hypothesis of 0 regression coefficients
Due to the execution of 0012098, the coefficient of determination is statistically important and the regression equation is reliable [2]
After determining the last regression equation, the correctness of the general equation is determined by the result of the autocorrelation coefficient
The Darbin-Watson test algorithm automatically calculates the autocorrelation of waste after determining the last equation specified in the program [3]
As a result of the program calculation, the hypothesis H0 having the value DW = 209, that is, without autocorrelation of waste, is received.
The program conducts automatic regressive and correlation analysis of the number of factors and the number of observations in the information system (in Figure 7)
The forecast uses a linear trend model and its functions
With inefficiencies where advantage is the easiest method of forecasting
The advantages of the PHP programming language in its multifunctional operation are robot parser technology
Parsing is carried out using technology, that is, the function of processing information from other sites

Automatic regression analysis
Full capabilities of this technology in the created information system
applied
The amount of news in the database will be removed from statistical sites each time an update is made
To predict the demographic indicator, individual analysis of the received information is carried out based on keywords
The information found based on the keyword is evaluated by the assigned factor
These coefficients are mainly generated by tables
The table contains information about each factor of the forecast year, as well as the fact that the estimated coefficients are added to the information about the factors
As a result, forecasting will be efficient and systematic (Figure 8)

Virtual University of Distance Learning Technology Model Education
In the context of the internationalization of education, distance education is of great importance
The creation of interactive television and the exchange of information online computer communication opens up new horizons
There are two models of distance learning
The first is an open university with a large number of students, where education is provided only by distance learning methods
Such open "universities with high probability" are often established as national educational institutions funded by public foundations
For example, Indira Gandhi University in Thailand Sukhotha Thammatirat University Terbuk University in Indonesia National Korean Open University and Open Radio University System in China
The Government views them as the basis of a socio-economic strategy for the development of knowledge and skills at the national level, and their level of support is very high
Universities for people to whom such universities are not intellectual or economic elites
Large distance learning organizations will join together in the exclusive group "MEGA Universities" (University of the World)
The most recognizable of them is the open university of Great Britain
The development of such large systems is considered in different ways
Organization going in the morning, with a large number of students and a variety of courses
composition and t
differs
So, the open radio and television university of China reports that more than a million students annually enroll in paid and free training courses
Education at the international level is currently rare, but this can change quickly, since in the future distance learning takes a stable position
Open advanced universities are characterized by certification and support of students in a centralized system of production and management of educational materials and a local training system
Many of them refuse to publish educational materials, some use the possibilities of radio and television
Many use computer-based evaluation and other computer-based management techniques to absorb a lot of work
Australia, based on the second model of distance learning USA Canada Sweden et al.
Higher education institutions of the CIS countries are of the opinion that education is carried out within or outside the university or college
Students who do not distinguish distance and full-time education in such institutions under the conditions of assessment of the level of education and diploma can move from one group to another
Students use distance learning materials in educational institutions in order to complete classical lecture and consulting models
Over the past decade, several international models of distance learning have appeared
They all offer certain partnerships and student support measures
Chairman of the Continuing Education Association (Canberra Australia) L.
Three models are presented in Moran's writings
An example of the first model is the Hong Kong Open Training Institute (AOI), which will receive a package of distance learning courses from other countries and give its certificate of completion with an assessment of the performance of students adapting them to the cultural environment
Initially, education was provided in English only, some courses have now been translated into Chinese at AOI and courses are being introduced that can only be taught in Chinese; there are programs for switching from one language to another
The key to the success of the IPA is to support the council, which teaches the academic language of students who influenced the inclusion of cultural specifications in original educational materials, and provides the necessary form of interaction
Forms of interactivity include an automated dialogue system with speech response, which allows you to perform individual classes and work independently with the manager in a calm place
This model requires a precondition - the institution must have international law on third-party materials
This is an expensive procedure that takes a lot of time
Implemented only with institutions based on a large market
The second model - partnership - one partner prepares educational materials and issues exams from students, and the other partner provides an educational support system and local management
As an example, the Optimistic Australian University partnership with Hong Kong Baptist College and Sepang Institute of Technology in Malaysia; Distinguished College Penanga collaborations with several Australian British and Canadian institutions
Students can take all courses in their places or have the opportunity to study the last courses abroad
This system is based mainly on printed materials and materials based on a stand-alone computer
Training and learning are provided in English, and some local partners teach students English
Provides training courses or other forms of language support
A third model is also being developed - "virtual learning systems" based on television and computer communications
It is much like a partnership model, because even though information technology can cross geopolitical boundaries, students still need local support from the authorities
The widespread use of virtual education is due to the desire of the organizers of such training to make a profit
The organization of online training was initially expensive, but in the future the cost of correspondence training will be less than for a traditional educational facility, which means that distance learning providers will receive a small income
It is no coincidence that distance learning is organized not only by traditional universities and private educational structures, but also by large media companies
As for the future of virtual learning, according to Western experts, distance learning, first of all, will increase the professionalism of the adult population, as well as satisfy the needs of those who love individual training and training
The development of online training will be useful if new pedagogical approaches are introduced, the quality of education is improved and various consumer needs are met
The education system via the Internet, making it active and interactive, which can enrich students' learning process
The use of additional online training materials will reduce the cost of organizing the educational process
However, the virtual model provides for the creation of regional and Panjahan companies and consortia, whose activities are carried out by local organizations - intermediaries and providers of additional services and electronic access tools
Nationally, the initiative of this model can be seen in consortia such as the open university system of Australia and the UK
Another initiative is the National University of Technology, which seeks to promote its television and computer programs of higher technical education from the United States to the Asia-Pacific region
Cable television operators in a number of Asian centers, together with distance education organizations, are considering the creation of "training channels" in an international and commercial partnership
At first, they can work as regular cable television or on-demand television, but video conferencing quickly moves to computer communications and information exchange online
The pace of evolution of such systems is directly related to the state of national technical infrastructure; affordable and high-quality fast broadband frequencies are mandatory conditions
German B
Scientist Roze shared plans to open a world center for distance learning through computer networks
American scientists
Chick and N
Carter is creating a future learning system, vice president of the University of Technology of New York N.
Carter will use computer masters to implement worldwide training programs
From their point of view, he will distribute educational materials collected from all the main centers of a certain television university
In their opinion, the Global Learn Network GLN should be based on the merger of personal computers capable of restoring information
Experts from renowned international universities are studying this network
creates training programs equipped with multimedia used to create
GLN Central Office is planned to be located in Switzerland, where the main computer information bank will be located, which will be constantly supplemented by training materials
"Knowledge is passed on to all the nations of the world," Carter said during a speech as a member of the GLN chair
"First of all, academic programs along with a single education will be distributed through this network.
University professors, especially natural and technical sciences, who are part of the global elite, will spread their know-how through the GLN network to professors in the medical industries of the environment and energy "
Curricula and subjects approved by the international council
Already today, the question is being asked about the creation of a unified system for issuing educational documents
Network operation is ensured by connecting telephone channels to ISDN to the main base in Geneva
Then the necessary program is sent to the consumer's computer and is interactively identified according to the individual type of training
With a subsequent computer, direct communication is carried out with the corresponding teacher thanks to a video camera and an alarm line
Permission for a large-scale art database is also provided
In addition, telenka data are planned for "third countries" that do not have the appropriate infrastructure
These automated workstations and training structures have access to high-level know-how via satellite
In universities and enterprises, such telenuses can also be used to improve education and professional skills
The initiators of the creation of GLN are about 50 scientific teams of enterprises, as well as representatives of national and international organizations
Among them: UNESCO International Telecommunications Union in Geneva, as well as 120 universities located in the USA, Switzerland, South Africa and the UK; manufacturers of American telecommunications giants ATT and Silicon Graph computers contribute to the provision of GLN with multimedia computers
Chick and Carter's thoughts rest on one barrier - funding request still open
Experts estimate the value of the initial investment at $200 million.
determined about
GLN will function as a commercial entity
Programs will be implemented
The cost of the first investment does not scare New York revolutionaries in the field of education
They hope that this project will be popular and after that will issue financing shares for the development of the network
Billions of dollars, from their point of view, will be returned only when these shares are issued
International organizations such as the EU and OECD, one of whose goals is to promote high-quality education through partnerships with member countries, see distance learning as the main factor in increasing access to education and improving the skills of citizens
In 1995-1999
in implemented programs for 2000-2006.
reflected in planned new programmes
EU member States and non-member States also support new initiatives to establish projects to promote information and communication technologies in education
Working groups on the development of information and communication technologies in education are organized within OECD
Group Task -
Defining information technology quality criteria for technology market analysis to facilitate consumer partnerships
Great attention is paid to distance learning related to the development of continuing education
In the 1990s, a number of organizations dealing with distance learning were established, including:
EADTU - European Association of Distance Teaching Universities;
EDEN - European distance education network;
ICDE - International Council for Distance Education
E-portfolio competence information and educational environment structure site portal
Kazakhstan participates in competitive process of international educational space on equal terms
Now the advantages of competition will be based on the study of people and information resources
Of all potential institutions, the Institute of Education defines rules and human rights in the modern world, since this is the socio-economic and cultural development of any society
One of the important aspects of modernization of education and, in general, modern life and culture is the process of informatization of the possibilities of new information technologies, which proposes to use the transparency of the process of developing professional competence of informatization methods and tools for student-oriented education
The main factor in the development of professional competence at the university is a focused student educational process, organized using information and communication technologies (ICT)
E-portfolio as a technology meets these requirements and is able to provide students with the formation of professional competencies
Certainty and objectivity are one of the main achievements of the e-portfolio
Informatization of e-portfolio education should be considered as a process of intellectualization of the activities of students and students (teachers and students), developing on the basis of the implementation of the possibilities of new means of information technology, here as protection of the subject sphere and environment (social environmental information and
) supports the integration trend of the process of recognition of legality
e-Portfolio technology coordinates the benefits of privatization and differentiation of learning, covering the multifaceted pedagogical impact on students and the guaranteed achievement of learning results expressed competently
The portfolio is actively used in foreign educational organizations and
different types are created and used in the educational process
Analyzing the types of e-portfolio used in education, few authors adhere to the original understanding of the portfolio as the owner of a package with information endorsing its professional achievements
Now there is only the concept of "boom" (which is a diverse set of information collected on the principle of an esim - a student or teacher), and everyone sees its structure and methods of filling by their understanding
Here is the portfolio
a package of work and results reflecting the progress and achievements of the portfolio owner in various areas;
education technology;
original evaluation form;
critical thinking technology;
forms and processes of organization of samples and products of trainee's educational activity;
means of a "self-navigation" medium;
The targeted Portfolio and the process of formation of education in the social sphere is usually understood as a way of fixing certain works in one data fund
Portfolio training arises in various areas of social and professional activity
For the purpose of the portfolio, it is planned to work in different types as a single system to indicate customers with conditions
Portfolio is a tool for determining or approving the level of development of the performer as a specialist
Regarding the creation of a portfolio (in a sense), it is a technology for replenishing and evaluating the individual achievements of a student over a certain period of training
is the purpose of a portfolio
The purpose of the portfolio is to provide a report on the educational process, reflecting control over the individual trajectory of the student for a significant "pattern" of education, his level of competence and assessment of the results of students
To build an e-portfolio, since any kind of portfolio, according to the authors, is hypermatic in nature and its components not only have indefinite contact, but also are active hyperlink in nature	linear	resources	to use	optimum	having visited		is
E-Portfolio Technology Defines Network Space Learning Process	allows you to use the interior with various subjects as a means of communication
E-portfolio can serve as an administrative tool for organizing and managing the educational process with the determination of their results and achievements, creating an educational environment for students with the purpose of teaching the discipline
The use of E-portfolio technology creates the ability of students to use it for professional and personal purposes, at any time makes it possible to fill an interband from any place and provides feedback to the teacher
facilitates transmission
All this also affects the requirements for an information and educational environment (VTsIOM) focused on the use of e-portfolio technology
In our opinion, VTsIOM, which characterizes the criteria for evaluating the ongoing personal-oriented process of continuing education, accurately describes the results and methods for achieving them
It includes the following components:
Methodological component determines methodology of formation and development of AHML taking into account development trends of educational organizations
Resource provision of scientific component pedagogical environment
forms the procedure for organizing the research activities of subjects to organize the dissemination of best practices for the analysis and calculation of the results of these activities
The control component forms a hierarchy of field elements, determines the rules for the functioning of the system of transfer of functions and representation of the role of the subject of education
Defines the forms and methods of education of methodological components and organization of educational processes, generates their reports for the purpose of training
The service component determines the function of the elements in the VTsIOM and the sequence of events in all probabilistic fields of the pedagogical environment
The organizational component provides workflow rules in the system for how to process and analyze the sequence of the primary event documentation in the CPI
The technical component forms the composition of the satirical and technical fund of the educational institution and ensures the functioning of all elements of the system of the specified mode in accordance with the established order
The content component defines the rules and conditions aimed at creating the educational trajectory of the student, the methodology for determining the content of information resources
The Human Resources component imposes requirements on participants in the educational process of instructor-consultant students
The municipal and component component defines the scheme of information flows in the pedagogical environment as communication of communication channels between elements of the Agency for Housing Mortgage Lending with the external environment
The creative component creates a procedure for stimulating the creative efforts of VTsIOM entities to organize creative activities in all spaces of the pedagogical environment
The personal component allows you to display the personality of the user of the site [1-8]

Thus, the structure of the site of the information and educational learning environment can be presented as a video with an artificially created organizational and methodological (pedagogical) technical information personalization and a set of software tools that include a specially organized synergistic effect
It is proposed to create its own computer and software and methodological manuals for the computer summary of the hardware and software teaching complex, which includes a form of training in various levels of education and various subject areas
The creation of the structure of the scientific and educational site (portal) of the organization of education provides, among other things, for the filling of information navigation and service sections
The E-portfolio structure is closely linked to various electronic resources through clear and opaque links and allows the use of available resources to purposefully build competencies
Portfolio with different roles in the educational process offers different formats/types of portfolio [9]
Timely assessment of the flexibility reflexion of the qualitative evaluation criterion to change the continuity of ways and means of monitoring and evaluating results allows the use of information transfer rate
The available approaches to the portfolio structure are combined with the general activities of the student:
The main feature of the portfolio is the systematization of all the results of the student's activities in education and their assignment to a teacher
Portfolio includes results of independent assessment of personal result of educational process, including level of formation of knowledge and competencies
The main special characteristic of an e-portfolio is an authentic assessment used in a practice-oriented activity and understood as a type of assessment, which provides for an assessment of the formation of individual and professional competence based on the artifact specified in the e-portfolio
Thus, the portfolio is a fractional image of the professional competence of the graduate, including general and special
Portfolio in each activity - educational creative social communication and
allows you to take into account the results of individual species
Accurate relationship with competencies should be the main feature of the proposed e-portfolio site structure
E-portfolio prepared for systematization and presentation of the performance of the person providing the primary competence
Files of different types (audio video graphics text) in the portfolio		work models, resume prices, lesson plans	twofold thinking
The e-portfolio allows you to archive materials from users of a wide range of sites, including for the student community and as a tutorial, and then distribute these materials
Thus, e-portfolio technology can be considered as a way to create an open education system that allows each student, based on available resources, to choose their own intensity, trajectory and learning technology and ensure transparency and objectivity of decisions.

Through the electrocardiogram, you can find out the following information: the presence of hypertrophy of the left stomach of the heart when the heart pulse is affected by myocardial infarction or ischemic myocardium
Figure 1 shows the image of the electrocardiogram measured by the PLUX tool (the Board collection is produced by PLUX)
Figure 1
Electrocardiogram (left) recorded on 2 electrodes (right) with 3 electrodes, registered on chest (right)
When measuring the electrocardiogram near the electrocardiograph, there should be no objects causing electrical barriers
For example, measurement should be performed away from physiotherapy rooms from X-ray rooms
To fix the contact of the skin with the electrode, it is allowed to burn a paste that passes an electric current to the head of the electrode with the removal of skin oil
When sending signals through waves by the electrocardiograph, the propagation of waves in the center should be taken into account
Today there are many types of electrocardiographs
For example, Medilog AR-
These electrocardiographs have their own features
The MICROVIT MT-101/200 interface of the electrocardiograph is written in more than 20 languages, and the electrocardiograph is HeartOne convenient for recording an electrocardiogram: the user must put two main fingers on the electrodes and press the button
Next Electrocardiogram Measuring Tool Name - Board Set
Board Collection
The Board consists of the following components: MCU Bluetooth charging modulotrocardiograph EMG EDA Accelerometer from diode batteries and 5 pre-gelled electrodes
Electromyography of human electrocardiogram with board set
you can define conductivity
Board platform is compatible with Arduino platforms
That is, if necessary, you can replace the Micro Controller Unit of the Board collection with the Micro Controller Unit Arduino
Board dialing signals can receive various programs
One of them is the support OpenSignals (r) evolution
The OpenSignals (r) evolution program interface consists of the following items: Device manager for device configurations, on which it is accepted to indicate information that received signals from the selected channel, BITalino communication settings of the online store OpenSignals (r) help in using the evolution program
OpenSignals (r) evolution can store information in the format American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)
Programmers can write applications based on these files
Figure 2 shows the text of the file saved in ASCII format
Figure 2
ASCII text format compiled by OpenSignals (r) evolution
The ASCII text format, as shown, consists of the subscription start time on behalf of the instrument (about) sampling rate and t
contains information
Analysis of electrocardiogram
The last six columns of the ASCII text format values of the OpenSignals (r) evolution program correspond to the corresponding EMG EDA ECGACC LUX RAW tools (for example, values measured 316313312 accelerometer tools)
To convert the measured values of the electrocardiogram tool into a unit of volt, use the formula 1:
In this formula VCC 3
The 3 volt ADC is equal to the channel value (the value specified in the file) 𝐺𝐸𝐶𝐺 1100 n 10
In line 12 of Figure 2, ADC is 0
To convert this value to a unit of volts, use the formula 1
For example
5 mV (for line 12)
882 mV (other example) 1100
Sample Rate Value in OpenSignals 1000 Setup
if a subscription is issued per second, there will be 1billion seconds between each subscription
While the sampling rate is 100 entries per second, there will be 10 milliseconds between each subscription
For example, in Figure 2, between entries 12 and 13 (lines) in 10 milliseconds
Heart pulse fixation has several lines: counting the fixation of the teeth of the R electrocardiogram in 1 minutes; Dividing the distance R-R by sixty seconds by measuring the distance in unit per second
There are algorithms for determining the R tooth of the electrocardiogram [3]
Algorithms determine time of recording of electrocardiogram teeth widths
That is, through these algorithms, we can control the stroke of the heart
Trailers electrocardiogram
To measure the electrocardiogram, it is necessary to select a trailer for measurement
Electrocardiogram trailer - potential difference measurement for electrocardiogram measurement
There are the following types of trailers: I II III standard aVR aVL aVFV1-V6
Standard trailer determines difference in two points of electric field and potentials of points on frontal plane
To measure the electrocardiogram in the standard trailer I, it is necessary to put the negative electrode grounding electrode of the left hand plus the right electrode
To measure the electrocardiogram on the II standard trailer on the left leg, it is necessary to put the ground electrodes of the right hand of the negative electrode on the right leg
In the standard trailer III, a negative electrode is placed on the left hand on the left leg plus the electrode on the right leg.

Electrocardiogram analysis requires determination of tooth amplitude width and tooth registration
[3] Based on the above derivative, the algorithm determines the denticle R from the electrocardiogram of algorithms based on the number of zero Pan-Tompkins cuts
The accuracy of the algorithm is affected by the correct use of the electrocardiograph
Because if the electrocardiograph is misused, the electrocardiogram may contain non-dental signals
Such signals can occur in the following cases: the movement of electrodes by a person, the influence of the external environment on him during the transportation of the signal

Educational lecture on programming languages of innovative technologies of research activities of students
The main directions and ideas for the introduction of innovative technologies in the field of education and the informatization process, which have become the catalysts for the development of the education system in the country today, the issues of training competitive specialists that underlie the country's sustainable economic development - State Institution for the Development of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2005-2010
in the educational program in the Concept of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2015 in the Strategy "Kazakhstan-2030" in the Strategic Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2020 "Nұrly Zhol - Way to the Future" (2014
) "Kazakhstan in a new large-scale reality: development of growth reforms"
Especially noted in Nazarbayev's Address to the people of Kazakhstan
In higher education: "
the need for an individual to achieve a high level of quality education in accordance with world educational practices that meet the needs of the labor market for the industrial and innovative development of the country "[1]
"Development of education and science in the Republic of Kazakhstan for the 100s," compiled on the basis of the Plan of the Nation "2016-2019 concrete steps"
in the state program "[2] Concrete measures for the further development of education and science
The main goal of the Program is to increase the competitiveness of education and science, the development of human capital for the sustainable development of the economy
Specific tasks that ensure the implementation of the goals are listed
One of the main issues of the Programme is the implementation of parallel proficiency in three languages
Currently, the experience of Nazarbayev intellectual schools is widely spread to all schools of the republic
A new structure for the development of pedagogical personnel is being introduced in the country, which is based on the research activities of the teacher
The issue of forming the research activity of a teacher is one of the most important issues of training specialists in pedagogical universities, which today are decided first of all
This should begin with the organization of research activities of students in pedagogical universities
Research activities of students - elements in the field of a specific scientific discipline aimed at solving the current problem are a combination of relationships and relationships
The difference between academic research activities of students and research activities is characterized by the creation of special conditions for the study of properties and phenomena of known environmental objects [3]
Training of future specialists in pedagogical universities is not limited only to educational time in the schedule of classes
This question will allow students in the conditions of training with credit technologies to gain deep knowledge of specialties through their independent work
Because the research activities of students ensure their well-being, the formation of the ability to constantly work in various fields of activity
A creative teacher who has developed professional skills organizes the learning process, creating conditions under which a student can independently fulfill knowledge and skills
It	at first	student	interest			to wake		from him		back		it	to develop new knowledge and skills on the basis of previously acquired knowledge and skills, creating conditions for mobilization for activity
Next, you should be able to publicly protect the results and monitor the results of all research actions of the teacher according to the level of knowledge and skills obtained by the student
Organization of research activities of students in pedagogical universities			modern		innovative				technologies	achievements	opportunities and opportunities		to the management	we receive
So	to read		of the Republic of Kazakhstan		properly establish research activities of students based on the use of innovative technologies
Thus, the proposed article envisages the future	computer science	experts	in preparation		special		subject		training
Consider one innovative method of organization
And innovative technologies are modified technologies caused by traditional technologies taking into account today's educational goals and objectives
Currently, improving the quality of training of informatics specialists is becoming one of the urgent problems of the education system
Programming training is one of the main subjects in the system of training future computer science teachers in pedagogical education with a degree in Informatics
Therefore, the Kazakh National Pedagogical University named after Abay introduced the course "Fundamentals of Traditimization and Programming" for students of the specialty "Informatics"
On the basis of this course, future computer science teachers will be trained for the basics of traditimization and programming
The main goal of computer science education in a general secondary school is the formation of a scientific forecast that informatics is a fundamental natural subject
The substantive direction "Traditimization and Programming" is one of the main fundamental components of the course of informatics in a secondary school
At the same time, in the process of training future informatics teachers, their sufficient possession of special and professional subjects depends on the levels of training in the field of traditimization and programming
As shown by the practice of teaching the subject of programming in pedagogical universities, a number of problems arise due to the lack of formation of traditimic thinking skills in students
One of the main issues - the programming course will consider not only proficiency in one imperative programming language, but also training in declarative programming - object-oriented programming
When moving from one type of programming to another, students have difficulties that require using not only the method of solving the delivered report, but also the method of changing the student's thinking activity
In studies related to the teaching of programming languages ​ ​ in pedagogical universities, two different points of view can be distinguished: the first is the linear study of one of the different programming languages ​ ​ [45] the second approach [67] from among different programming languages ​ ​
And we propose to master the syntax of two programming languages ​ ​ in teaching the most imperative programming
In general practice, it is known that when learning two programming languages, one after another goes twice
Why do I need to learn the syntax of two programming languages? Firstly, most universities in this specialty "Informatics" study the programming languages ​ ​ C/C + +
Secondly, the Pascal programming language is still taught in a secondary school according to the state educational standard
And as practice shows, for a student from high school who has not studied a single programming language, it is much more difficult to master the programming language, starting with the C/C + + language.
And Pascal is easy and convenient to explain the basics of programming
Parallel learning in two programming languages can be done as follows:
Training is provided through lectures and laboratory sessions
Tasks will also be developed to organize students' independent educational activities
If the programming language is learned one after another, the program structure includes a separate time for training the main types of algorithm of the data type and
lectures and lab sessions
And with parallel training in two languages, it takes only one time to teach these theoretical materials, analyzing the main algorithms of the report output, a block diagram is created and its program in the programming language is provided in two languages ​ ​ at the initial stage
And if the program of one of the main algorithms analyzed to gain time during the lecture lesson is presented in Pascal, then the following example will be presented in S/S + +
Practice has shown that such an approach is effective for sufficient understanding and memorization by the student of the basic algorithms of the programming course
Consider how to find the largest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclid algorithm (EUOB) in a lecture lesson
The ECB detection algorithm is as follows and let's look at it for your own situation
Enter the algorithm for finding the maximum common divisor for ECB numbers (3645) step by step
We get the smaller from the first number 45 - 36 = 9, replacing its difference with the value of the first two numbers, we get two new numbers - 9 and 36
Again we get the smaller of two numbers 36 - 9 = 27, replacing its difference with the value of these two numbers, we get two new numbers: 9 and 27
We get even smaller of two numbers 27 - 9 = 18, replacing its difference with the value of those two numbers, we get two new numbers: 9 and 18
Again we get the smaller of two numbers: 18 - 9 = 9, replacing its difference with the value of these two numbers, we get two new numbers: 9 and 9
Now that we have received two identical numbers, this number is the EUOB of 45 and 36
Therefore, the value of this algorithm is explained by the continuation of the process of replacing the country with this figure with the difference in the value of the number until the final results are equal
If two digits are equal, the process stops and returns the ECB of the given number
Now we will analyze the program of this algorithm in programming languages
In the Program Description section:
To describe two given integers, describe the variables a b and a1 b1 to store two given original numbers
In the body of the program:
Output Operator prompts you to enter integers
Enter the values of variables a and b through the input operator
Their values through the property operator are placed in memory with the property of variables a1 and b1
The condition written to the While recurrence statement does not have a value of b and is repeated until it is terminated, namely, before the value of a is equated to the value of b
And in the body of the cycle there is only one control operator: if the value of a is greater than the value of b, then "a - b" by a, otherwise b will belong to "b"
If the value of a b is equal, the repetition process stops and control in the program is transferred to the next release operator
The common separator of the two numbers issued by the output operator will be printed on the screen
Now we will create a program
Here are the ECB detection algorithm programs in Pascal and C++
In laboratory classes, the student performs the proposed reporting system in two programming languages
After each laboratory work, students check the specifics of the implementation of the program related to the syntax of the language, and conclude on the effectiveness of its release
Using this methodical approach, we gain students' conscious understanding of the specifics of each programming language
In the future, the specialist will be able to independently determine in which language any report can be effectively displayed, and it is easy to translate it into other programming languages
The main problem here is understanding the report output algorithm
In parallel learning programming languages, you can organize labs in several ways
According to the first method, each student performs laboratory tasks in both programming languages, generates reporting skills, performing tasks in both languages
Comparison of reporting methods in two programming languages
This process is demonstrably shown by the student during each laboratory work
According to the second method, students perform a system of tasks divided into several groups (three or four) in two student programming languages ​ ​ in each group
Proposed tasks for this approach will be presented as a project
At the end of laboratory work, students will defend projects
The block, analyzing the algorithm, how to output the report presented during project protection, is shown in the form of a diagram with subsequent execution of the program in two languages
At the same time, the final opinion of students will be voiced on what approach is easily implemented in the programming language
Summing up the project protection is completed by the teacher together with the students
The opinion of students in each group is necessarily heard
As a result, students fully cope with the task and develop skills to master the program in two programming languages
Dual Language Mapping Training
allows you to understand and remember the syntax structure
Incomplete laboratory work on both methods students complete at home
In addition, laboratory work for the formation of practical skills is provided with tasks for the student to work independently in accordance with the rules of credit training technology
The method of parallel learning of two programming languages ​ ​ is carried out on the basis of project training methods and relies on other modern innovative teaching methods
Students from the first year will learn to accumulate an electronic portfolio
Summarizes reports and completed projects published in two programming languages into its portfolio

MIXTURES OF GASES CONSISTING OF NITROGEN OXIDATION AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF DIFFUSION AND GRAVITATIONAL CONVENTION
FEATURES OF CONDENSATION DISTRIBUTION
Isothermal multi-component deviation in mixtures of organic components H2 + N2O - N2zhәne CH4 + N2O - Arush of component gases was experimentally studied by a two-column method at different pressures in binary mixtures and given concentrations of components
In a system where diffusion coefficients at a certain pressure differ significantly from each other, special modes arise associated with high speeds of components formed as a result of concentration of components
At the initial stage of the convention, the intensity of its dependence on pressure varies linearly
Molecular diffusion occurs in a mixture with comparable Dij coefficients.
In the error zone of the experiment, the results on the practical nature of the concentration of components and the Stefan-Maxwell equations coincide
The practical value of the concentration of components corresponds to the calculations made according to the Stefan-Maxwell equations in the field of experimental errors

The development of model theory is divided into two historical directions
Well-known specialist Ch
Keisler in his work called west and east, that is, one of the founders of model theory A.
Tarsky lived in the 1940s on the west coast of the United States, and the second founder - A.
Robinson stood on the east bank
The theory of Western models is developed by the traditions of Skulem and Tarsky
In general, questions of number theory in this direction concern the theory of sets in which the formulas of all primary languages ​ ​ are provided
Oriental models developed with Maltsev through Robinson
The formulas of these theories consist of two quantors and investigate the questions of abstract algebra
And consists of a set of quantum formulas and existential formulas
Unlike Western model theory, which studies complete theories, the theory of initial models considers incomplete theories
The class of incomplete theories has a broad meaning, so we can limit ourselves to inductive theory (-aksiomatizatsiyalanғan)
All these conditions satisfy the conditions of the johnson theory
The following conclusion is that studies on yonson theory relate to the problem of "consumable" model theory
This article refers to one of the points of model theory, namely to ilson collections
The direction of the theory of these models is intended to read incomplete inductive theory, that is, Johnson theory and some of their generalizations
Moreover, he explores the modular-theoretical properties of some yonson theory in the yonson set of the semantic model

Mathematical models of processes occurring in the nature of many processes are characterized by mutual differential equations
The most common methods for solving discrete problems are the method of nervousness
Expanding the scope of digital practices for practical purposes will contribute to their development as well as to increasing demand for them
The simplicity of this implementation is applicable to complex structures with the ability to apply economics for a wide range of tasks
Currently, one of the most common methods for quantifying border reports is differential methods (grid method is the final method of difference)
These methods are in permanent places (rectangular circle parallelepiped ball, t
) is very convenient for solving problems
Their use in complex structures leads to a number of difficulties in constructing one-time circuits, as well as in implementing a computer

Collision phenomena in non-ideal dense plasma are quantified based on effective particle exposure potential
The dependence on the velocity of the electron distribution function in a strong electric field and the dependence of the collision frequency of particles on ideal parameters and density parameters is obtained
It was shown that shielding and quantum phenomena in a dense non-ideal plasma lead to a maximum in the electron collision frequency curve for some values ​ ​ of the non-ideal parameter, as well as an increase in the particle distribution function in a strong electric field as the plasma density decreases
Function of distribution of collision processes of dense plasma non-ideal plasma particle collision frequency

Communication competence in the article is carried out in connection with the change in the educational paradigm within the framework of personal-oriented pedagogical technology, which forms the basis for the transition from control over students to self-control from social development to self-realization of development from monologue to dialogue
Competence - a typical of thinking that allows you to quickly solve problems and tasks that exist in the ability to carry out practical activities that require a certain conceptual system
Keywords, characteristics of communication competence of students, concepts of competence, description of the main units in updating the content of education
Personal-oriented education as an educational methodology, which most relies on the problems of the theory of the formation of key competencies, allows you to create an individual trajectory for the development of the student, focusing on the characteristics of the individuality of each student
The introduction into practice of specialized education of students and the creation of the theory of the formation of key competencies today becomes the most relevant issue for world pedagogical science and practice
Unique changes in Kazakhstan's educational character make it oriented towards the free development of a person due to his high cultural activity.
This direction requires a new approach to the formation of the student's personality
Students - changing the pedagogical goals arising from the development of teacher-oriented education by the pedagogical community set the task of determining a full-format and socially integrated result
The general definition of such an integrated socio-personal concept as the result of education recognizes the concept of competence/competence, which gives a set of cognitive-value worldview communicative compounds
In this case, the first definition is usually associated with the qualities of the Tula, in which procedural tasks and rights are established in a certain area, the second is what follows from the relation of competence to the action manifested in specific actions.
The concepts of "Competence" "Competence" are now known only at the level of research in pedagogical science
Therefore, a clear definition of these concepts has not yet been formed
This is the main evidence of the relevance of our research work
In the dictionary of foreign words, the concept of "competence" is interpreted as the sphere of authority of a person or the sphere of issues and affairs that must be conducted by the same person with competence
Competent (French) - competent authorized competents (lat.
) - compatible competition (;
) - ability (competence) [1]
The concept of "competence" has appeared in the world of work and industrial enterprises
The term "core competence" was first adopted by the Council of Europe in 1992.
Appeared in the project "Secondary education in Europe"
The objective of the project was to analyse educational objectives and mechanisms for assessing the educational achievement of schoolchildren in European Union countries.
The International Labour Organization has introduced the concept of "key competencies" among the qualification requirements of specialists undergoing the system of postgraduate education and advanced training of management personnel
Key competencies in the training of specialists in a professional school have been voiced since the 1990s
Competence "Competence"	concepts	value	to open	For this, an analysis of philosophical edagogyclikpsychological literature was carried out.
Competent philosophical interpretation opens the way to discoveries and innovations related to the knowledge and practice of a person, and also makes it possible to determine in each class the requirements for education to the pedagogical situation [2]
Competence (the Latin word competens-compatible) - the presence of skills and skills corresponding to this work, along with a deep and fundamental biluson of tools and ways to achieve the goal.
Literacy level sufficient to establish the position of independent solution of cognitive problems arising in the process of independent education of general cultural studies [3]
The specific ability required to effectively perform specific actions in a subject-specific area and includes ways to think about specific knowledge, as well as understanding responsibility for their actions
Personal capabilities of an official, allowing through certain knowledge and skills to participate in decision-making or independently solve issues, his/her qualifications (education and experience)
The author associates the concept of "competence" with the perfection of the person and his achievement in a state that allows him to perform productive actions and achieve good results in the performance of labor duties [4]
Thus, competence is a general ability to learn from learning, based on a propensity for values ​ ​ to experience
Competence does not apply to knowledge or skills
Competence is what gives rise to efficiency
Competence is formed in the course of conscious action
Competent learning depends on the activity of the student
Work for Work Training
listening to scientific reports on relationships is useless in order to learn how to enter into relationships
It is impossible to master them until they speak English or Russian
Only in practice can you learn how to work on a computer
The visibility of competence is affected by certain circumstances
Competency is the adaptation of your knowledge and experience to this situation
In everyday life, you can find that educated people do not know how to use this knowledge if necessary in specific situations
Thus, it is necessary to create specific conditions for the formation of competence so that they are visible
A range of issues and phenomena in which a person has experience in knowing the authority in a certain area
Social competence - social skills that allow you to correctly fulfill the norms and rules of life in society
The term social pedagogy
Individual characteristics of the degree corresponding to the requirements of the specialty-competence
Competence - the ability to understand the type of thinking that allows you to quickly solve problems and tasks that arise that can carry out practical activities that require a certain conceptual system [5]
Ability and readiness for the action of a person based on knowledge and experience learned in the process of training, aimed at the independent participation of the competent person in the educational and cognitive process and its preparation for the correct introduction into labor activity
Competence - a set of interrelated personality qualities defined in relation to certain substances and processes necessary for the qualitative and productive performance of certain actions
By summarizing the definitions thus issued, the concept of competence is linked to a conscious understanding of the object of the action of the subject and the instrument of its implementation.
Competence - the choice to use competencies according to this situation
Tools that open doors can be interpreted as keys for mastering new situations expressed on key competencies
Key competence is what meets the conditions for implementing the reasons for determining competence, not limited to, but to a certain extent universal
Competencies specified by subject and key
Special importance is given to the five core competencies groups identified by the Council of Europe
Political and social competencies: participation in decision-making that can assume responsibility, participation in the functioning and improvement of conflict democratic institutions
Competence for viability in a multidisciplinary society: preventing the spread of racism and xenophobia, education should equip youth with intercultural competencies such as understanding identity, respect for other cultural languages and the ability to live together with people in religion
On possession of oral and written forms of communication	the relevance of the latter in work and public life is such that a person who does not have existing competencies is threatened with removal from society
This group also includes knowledge of several languages ​ ​ that matter today
Ownership of the new technology of competencies related to the use and recognition of public information, identification of its strengths and weaknesses in understanding its application and critical treatment of information and advertising disseminated by the media
Lifelong learning capacity as a basis for continuous training and training, as well as for private and public life
Within the framework of the project "Secondary education in Europe," a list of key competencies has been formed:
Research: the ability to benefit from practice; Linking and managing their knowledge; the ability to organize their own ways of learning; the ability to solve a problem; ability to learn independently
Search: searching for various information; Query from the environment advising the expert; obtaining information; working with documents and classifying them
Thinking: organizing the relationship between past and current events; critical attitude towards the development of society on a certain side; countering mistrust and hardship; the need for health and assessment of social habits related to the environment; ability to evaluate works of art and literature
Cooperation: ability to collaborate in a group; Decision-making; the ability to resolve conflicts; ability to negotiate, prepare and conclude a contract
Entry into action: entry into the project; responsibility; joining a group or team and contributing; the ability to organize their work; working with computing and model devices
Adaptation: the ability to use new information and communication technologies; withstand difficulties; the ability to make new decisions
This list is approved as a working document to define key competencies
Therefore, we do not consider the above list as the end result of key competencies
A description of the core competencies system developed at Cambridge and Oxford University indicates that competences are developed in the process of learning and professional activities, for example, in the implementation of various actions
UNESCO documents define the fundamental goals and objectives of education of the 21st century: education education; job training and money-earning; ability to act; life education; learn to live together
In general secondary education in the Republic of Lithuania, taking into account the main activities that allow the student to acquire life skills and practical experience of mastering social experience in society, the following key competencies are defined: social competence; competence of knowledge; communicative; creativity; critical thinking and problem solving; learning ability; competence of a healthy lifestyle
The communicative competence of students consists of linguistic language discursive pragmatic cultural components
The main linguistic knowledge of the linguistic component includes the ability to create and understand types of discourse with a formalized component from the knowledge of the linguistic component of the norm of oral and written speech in Russian
The pragmatic component reflects the preparation for the delivery of communicative content in a certain communication situation, and the cultural component gives knowledge of speech culture at the grammar level
These components correspond to the results of education specified in the state compulsory standard of secondary education of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Based on the gradual development of communication skills of students
It relates to the training process
Introducing the concept of "subgroup" requires the introduction of creative exercises
Texts of different genres are didactic units in the process of forming communication competencies of students based on personal-oriented education
This will improve the adaptive qualities of students
In order to summarize this section, it is worth noting the concept of "competence" "competence"
Competence refers to entrepreneurship, not education
Competence is a general property based on a tendency to the values ​ ​ of the experience of knowledge accumulated during training
Competence does not apply to knowledge or skills
Here you need to distinguish between authorizations and business concepts
Business-specific activity, and competent business - a characteristic obtained from actual control
Thus, business competence in this activity
Competence is what causes skill
Powers are created in the course of conscious action
Ownership depends on student activity
Worked	it is useless to listen to scientific reports on relationships in order to learn how to enter into relationships that you need to work on
It is impossible to master them until they speak English or Russian
Only in practice can you learn how to work on a computer
Thus, in order to acquire authority, the student must become the subject of his conscious action
Competence is contextual
Certain circumstances affect the visibility of competence
Empowering is to adapt your knowledge and experience to this situation
In everyday life, one can find that educated people cannot apply this knowledge when necessary in specific situations
Thus, for the formation and formation of competence, they must create clear conditions so that they are visible
Developed based on the initial level of competence, enriched and consolidated
The concept of "competence" is linked to a conscious understanding of the object of the action of the subject and the instrument of its implementation

It is worth noting that the improvement of the methodological course of study in mathematical analysis remains relevant within the walls of schools and universities.
The key role of mathematical analysis in school is not the continuity of many mathematical disciplines: this is necessary only for the few participants who study deeply in higher education and do not increase the ability to think logically: the stages of mathematical analysis are unlikely for a "rigid" presentation of mathematics in a school course
The main role of mathematical analysis elements in the course of mathematics in a comprehensive school is to create opportunities for expanding applications to mathematics in this school
This is useful not only for other disciplines using mathematics, but also for the general course of this mathematics

For the system of linear linear differential equations, an integral conditional extreme calculation is provided
To solve this foreseen report, the parameterization method is used, that is, unknown parameters are entered at the starting point of the slice separation intervals specified as the solution value
The main purpose of this method is that the interval in which the differential equation is considered is divided into parts with a certain positive step and the initial calculation is led to an equivalent parameter
Equivalent parametric extreme calculation consists of continuity conditions at the separation points from the integral condition due to the Cauchy edge for the system of parametric differential equations
The solution of a multipoint parametric extreme report is defined as the limit of the parameters and circuits of a system of a pair of functions
An unknown parameter is a system of linear algebraic equations defined by a matrix of extreme conditions and differential equations, and the function is the solution of Cauchy calculation in a given interval in the found value of the parameter
Sufficient conditions for unambiguous determination of the calculation provided on the basis of this method have been determined, and an algorithm for solving the report has been proposed
The parameter method of the final report integral conditional Cauchy report has an unambiguous solution

In the article, recurrence formulas of the quantitative solution of the 1st extreme calculation of the second-order differential equation are obtained, similar to the formula of classical confirmation (Thomas algorithm in the English literature) with unsatisfactory results of the widely valid confirmation method
In an independent case, very important conditions are provided: the coefficient of the equation (negative or variable) and boundary conditions do not satisfy the calculated stability conditions of the method of confirming wide action
As a result, a new algorithm is proposed, which is an alternative to the method of quantitative solution of secondary linear differential equations set by boundary treaties
The obtained formulas can be used for quantitative resolution of primary boundary calculations with a break factor
The algorithm is applied to specially selected examples reflecting the characteristics of the considered boundary calculations

The article provides for taking into account the propagation of dynamic waves on a dynamic body specified by homogeneous boundary conditions
The provision of homogeneous border conditions in extreme reports of the class under consideration poses great challenges
The wave process results from the application of an external dynamic load on the surface wall of a rectangular body, in particular by transmitting velocity vectors to this surface wall.
And on the lower wall of a rectangular body, non-uniform boundary conditions are established
Combined calculation in the term of stresses and speeds is solved, in particular, by the method of digital spatial characteristics
Using an improved numerical method, rational computational relations are obtained for detecting exquisite functions at a special point of contact between fixed and empty parts of the lower wall.
The boundary agreement provides for the concentration of dynamic stresses arising near points with interruptions

X-RAY SPECTRA IN 10-325 K TEMPERATURE RANGES IN KBR AND KCL CRYSTALS
The article describes the temperature dependence of radiation bands between the temperatures of 10-325 K of KBr and KCl crystals obtained at the X-ray luminescence spectrum measurement plant at the Nikolay Copernicus University in Torun (Poland)
Here, unlike the excitons of the strong-off configuration, bands with an intensity associated with annihilation of excitons "symmetry" when the temperature drops below 30 K are fixed.
The dependence of X-ray luminescence on the temperature in the CBD crystal coincides with the temperature dependence of the exciton capture dam
In the KCl crystal, the intensity of the bands associated with the reabsorption of F-centers at a temperature below 30 K increases.
Fixed radiation bands and patterns of their change play an important role in the creation of photochromic materials for recording stintillation and holograms

This article provides a method for calculating the dynamic and aerodynamic parameters of the Darrier wind turbine with two blades on one blade and four blades
A series of digital experiments reflecting periodic changes in aerodynamic forces of angular velocity oscillations and their radial tangent components is carried out by the calculation method
For each wind turbine with two blades with two blades and four blades, these parameters have a different character of change
For example, the variation of aerodynamic forces in the radial direction depends on the number of blades
The more blades, the greater the oscillation frequency
Thus, the nature of the change in these forces creates vibration in the rotating power

Boundary calculations in the combination of bodies of various sizes alternate in many engineering applications, in particular when analyzing the dynamics and strength of mechanical structures and machines and predicting their reliability
The geometry of joining bodies of different sizes is complex, which makes it difficult to effectively solve the corresponding boundary calculations
In the technical literature, you can find simplified methods for describing the calculations of combining bodies of various sizes
One of the simplest methods involves a moderate-sized model, where structures are represented as a system of discrete masses with serious elastic constraints
The most adequately characterized models are structurally resilient inertial and dissipative (shell plates), as well as three-dimensional (thick disks thick cast cylinders, t
) as an integrated system of dynamic bodies
Asymptotic theories for thin plate rods and shells attracted the attention of researchers early, but the problem of asymptotic analysis of the fusion of bodies of various sizes arose relatively recently
These reports are based on questions from scientists Ciarlet and Destuynder (1979), who still ask many interesting questions
In the proposed article, asymptotics of eigenvalues and eigenvalues of the Steklov report are considered in a combination of thin and identical dimensions of rectangles
The spectral calculation of Steklov is an asymptotic type of the Sobolev space of the Lebesgue space of bodies of various sizes

CORRECTNESS OF INTERMEDIATE CALCULATIONS FOR HYPERBOLIC-PARABOLIC NAVIGATION OF MULTISURITY OF KAZAKHSTAN
In the study of mathematical models of the spatial electromagnetic plane, the basis of the electromagnetic process is determined by its properties
If the medium is impermeable, then we come to multidimensional hyperbolic equations
Given in multidimensional parabolic equations if the mean is multipass
Therefore, when studying electromagnetic planes in complex environments (for example, a variable hole in a conducted environment), we come to multidimensional hyperbolic-parabolic equations
When studying these applications, you need to find specific report solutions
Basic mixed calculations are well studied for reduced multivariate hyperbolic equations in the space of generalized functions
Aldashev's works proved the validity of these reports and received a clear classical solution to the report
It is known that no exact solution to such calculations for reduced multivariate hyperbolo-parabolic equations has been found
The article presents mixed reports with an unambiguous solution and provides a specific classical solution for reduced multivariate hyperbolo-parabolic equations.

INTERMEDIATE CALCULATIONS FOR SMALL HYPERBOLIC SEAS
It is known that dynamic oscillations of the membrane in space according to Hamilton's rules can be modeled by multidimensional hyperbolic equations
Investigation of heat distribution process in medium filled with mass leads to multivariate parabolic equations
Thus, studying the mathematical modeling of the heat distribution process in a dynamic membrane, we come to multidimensional hyperbolo-parabolic equations
When studying these applications, it becomes necessary to clearly display the solutions to the investigated issues.
For reusable hyperbolic equations, the basic mixed calculation is well studied
This report was reviewed for multivariate hyperbolic equations reduced in the space of generalized functions
As is known, mixed calculations for multivariate hyperbolo-parabolic equations have been little studied
The article shows a unique resolve that excludes a clear form of the classical solution of mixed calculation to reduced three-dimensional hyperbolic equations

The organization of the educational process at the current stage of the development of the university system requires the choice of methods and forms of organizing training programs with an increase in the proportion of their independent work aimed at intensifying the educational activities of students
In this article, we analyzed a set of questions to find the limit of a function
The analysis identified issues with between one and three elements
At the same time, one of the disadvantages encountered in the analyzed set of exercises can be considered a high percentage of questions returned of the same structure
We have developed a reporting system on the topic "Calculating the limits of functions," aimed at enhancing the academic activities of students in this work.
Systematization in this calculation system is carried out by gradually increasing their complexity based on the development of the reporting structure, and at each level of complexity - as the problem increases

Many mechanical physical chemical-biological and t in nature
mathematical study of phenomena usually leads to the solution of independent derivatives of differential equations
Therefore, in many universities of the country, the equations of mathematical physics or the subject of differential equations with independent derivatives are studied in the preparation of natural-technical specialties
However, in most cases, this subject is studied in a one-way direction, that is, mathematical specialists pay special attention to physics of physicists in the mathematical part.
For example, when students solve a wave equation using certain mathematical methods, he does not pay attention to what characterizes its solution in the physical sense
This paper examines the physical interpretation of the Cauchy report solution for wave equation, which is often left out of the curriculum via Maple 11, drawing attention to such problems
The article shows examples of a given initial wave deviation and a graph of propagation over the initial speed (that is, viewing wave movements)
There is also a physical interpretation of the Cauchy report solution for the wave equation given by half

Calculations included in the mixture (solution) of one of its components are special types of calculations for concentration
Unfortunately, not only schoolchildren, but also some mathematics teachers did not master the elementary technique of solving such problems.
Many of its reasons are one of the main reasons that the school curriculum and school textbooks on mathematics do not pay due attention to this type of calculation
School experience shows that graduates when passing UNT poorly issue these types of reports submitted for concentration
Therefore, the article gives a non-standard effective method of solving such calculations, provided as a special type of calculations, in which one of the components of the mixture (solution) is included, per concentration

This scientific article contains questions about the fact that when water is irradiated with an infrastructure wave, some of its properties change
Simple crane water is irradiated with a low-frequency iphrade generator in the frequency range from 7 to 19 Hz
Water in the amount of one liter was exposed to low frequency sound vibrations for 10-15 minutes
Then measured is hydrogen index pH and acid-reducing potential or redox potential
The results of the study showed that between the pH indicator and the size of the redox potential (MPC) there is a dependence on the frequency of radiation
The pH and MPC values of the water exposed to radiation decrease compared to the source water with an increase in the frequency of radiation
This means that the simple water of the crane can be changed using low frequency sound vibrations
The results will allow to determine the fine structure of water and carry out further studies

AS A WAY OF IMPLEMENTING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
This article will consider the future development of distance learning technology and the need to implement its scientifically based methodology
There are identified problems and contradictions in the field of organization of remote form of training
Of course, digitalization of education is a multifactorial and complex process
In this regard, the form of distance learning in the Republic of Kazakhstan should be established by law as an independent form of education, and the system of distance learning should be carried out with a deep scientific outlook
On the one hand, the country is actively developing domestic educational software systems, on the other hand, they and their didactic capabilities are not used in the system of distance learning
Therefore, the following contradiction can be noted: there is no scientifically sound methodology for the implementation of distance learning, although there are prerequisites for the intensive development of distance learning
Thus, the task of developing a scientific understanding of distance learning has arisen, which should ensure the growth of educational networks and meet educational needs in the field of vocational education
It is necessary to create an appropriate methodological basis for the development of a remote education system, which in turn is associated with the scientific and pedagogical development of the methodology for organizing a remote form of training

VERIFICATION OF PROGRAMS BY MODEL SOLUTION
Each system algorithm is the key to building reliable distributed systems
These algorithms must ensure the correct operation of these algorithms in order to guarantee the reliability of the system
However, it is known that model checks of strength-based algorithms are only possible for small systems [1]
In the end, it is necessary to automatically check the fixed distributed algorithms in large systems
This is aimed at improving the reliability of computing systems, so it is very important that they do the right work according to the requirements of algorithms
In the argument of correctness of algorithms distributed at the temporal level for various non-termistic nodes, it will be very easy to make mistakes
Therefore, they cannot be reliable materials for model validation
However, the method of checking the model for reliability of distributed algorithms is very complex

The methodological system of training future teachers in the use of ICT in professional activities, along with training in the use of specific technologies, should be aimed at developing methodological approaches to the selection and use of digital technologies in their professional activities with the teacher
This, in turn, is necessary to achieve pedagogically important positive results and improve the quality and effectiveness of the educational process
This is a very significant property of the methodological system, because in the conditions of informing society, digital technologies are developing rapidly
Improvement of teaching methods and tools and ways of organizing practical and cognitive actions of students based on the application of ICT tools to the teacher in the context of knowledge informatization; organization of educational management; information and methodological support and
tasks are worthwhile
At the same time, it is necessary to form a critical attitude towards the knowledge of future teachers, that is, the understanding that any education will quickly become obsolete
Future teachers should be prepared to use different teaching methods and techniques, involving them in research and understanding their effectiveness
Informatization of knowledge leads to a constant change in the educational environment, as well as the need to always master new types of activities (information) for all participants in the educational process
Therefore, requirements for the training of future teachers are undergoing changes, and continuous improvement of the teacher's qualifications is a necessary element of the profession

ACCURACY OF INTERMEDIATE CALCULATION FOR HYPERBOLIC-PARABOLIC MONOGS
In mathematical modeling of electromagnetic fields in space, the nature of the electromagnetic process is determined by the properties of the medium
If the medium is impermeable, we get hyperbolic equations with multivariate shortening
If the medium has greater conductivity, then we proceed to multivariate reduced parabolic equations
Therefore, the analysis of electromagnetic fields in a complex medium (for example, if the conductivity of the medium changes) is led to hyperbolo-parabolic equations with multivariate shortening
When researching these applications, it becomes necessary to clearly represent the solutions of the investigated reports
The main mixed calculations for hyperbolic equations are well studied
The report for multivariate hyperbolic equations arising in these generalized spaces was reviewed earlier
Aldashev's articles proved the accuracy of this report and received a clear picture of the classical solution
As is known, mixed calculations for multivariate hyperbolo-parabolic equations have been little studied
The article shows a unique resolve that excludes a clear form of the classical solution of mixed calculation to reduced three-dimensional hyperbolo-parabolic equations

STORAGE LAWS FOR INTEGRABLE DISPERSIONS
Recently, interest in integrable equations and disassociable and quasi-classical hierarchy constraints has been significantly distributed.
The study of discordless hierarchies is of great importance, since it arises in the theory of physics and applied mathematics and in analysis from quantum fields and gut theory to conformal image theory in the complex plane
Generalized related dispersion equations were first solved with the proposal of Konno and Oono and the use of the backward scattering accounting method
Various methods were used to study variance equations and hierarchies
Darbu and Becklund transform used
Also an important role in the study of nonlinear evolutionary equations is played by the laws of integrated linearization and compliance with respect to parking lots
This article states that conservation laws for nonlinear evolutionary equations are determined by calculations of the Riccati method using the Lux pair
We expect the power and efficiency of this system method to be well understood, and other nonlinear evolutionary models may be useful even for models with high sequential and variable coefficients

In this paper, we linked the deformation of space AdS5 × S5 and Young-Baxter to gut theory
Deformation is transmitted by the solution of the r-matrix of the classical Young-Baxter equation (KYABT)
for the bosonic intestine, taking into account the deformation of space AdS5 - we considered the metric of eformation?
For reduction of the same metrics in the deformed look we use a bivector of a space-time metrics of A μν, connected with group of an isometry and Li's algebra, the solution of KIaBT - r-matrixes and antisymmetric Θμν
Using the example of these values, you can calculate the deformation of the metric and the Bianchi space-time metric
The new type of the deformed metrics with putting down And μν a metrics and a bivector Θμν in the set formulas with reduction to matrix type is received
In this case, two types of deformed metric were considered at k = 0 and k ≠ 0
In the case of k ≠ 0, conversions for compact recording are introduced, since the values ​ ​ of [mu] v and g [mu] v are volumetric

Modelling of diffusion of two gases under inter-isothermal conditions was carried out equally when mixing with the third gas
As the main diffusing gases, helium and argon are liquefied in one case with methane and in the other with nitrogen equally within wide concentration limits
Diffusion and convective modes of the process have been studied
The calculation was made within the framework of the stability theory extended to isothermal conditions in the mixture of three gases
Stability maps obtained for systems considered at different concentrations of ballast gas
It is shown that intensity of diffusion and convective modes at diffusion of main components depends on initial concentration of gas-liquefier (ballast gas)
The increase of ballast gas in the composition of the mixture leads to a decrease in the speed of the process of diffusion and convective modes

The paper proposes a method for constructing solutions of differential equations and their systems with constant coefficients of the second order, different from traditional
Typically, independent solutions of an equation or system of equations are created using elements of a complex analysis with a negative discriminant of the characteristic equation
The proposed method is distinguished by the creation of these independent solutions without reference to the theory of complex analysis
The node of the method in the state of a homogeneous equation is to construct linear independent independent solutions of second-order linear equations using the Bernoulli method used to solve the first linear equation
In that the right side of the method node in the conditions of an uneven equation is determined by comparing the parameters of the equation that are not related to the roots of the descriptive equation, independent solutions of the equation given as an exponential function and a multiple-coefficient linear combination of cosine and sine

Discrete continuous weight estimates have many applications in harmonic analysis, which occupy an important place in the theory of integral and differentiated operators, in the theory of differential equations, the theory of introducing functional spaces in variation calculations and other areas of mathematics
One of the important questions in the study of serious inequalities is the establishment of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the implementation of these weight estimates
However, this criterion, which establishes a weighted assessment when solving various reports, may not fit the object under investigation, so other alternative criteria should be applied in this case.
In this work, a discrete analogue of the integral value (4) (basic lemma) is established, which allows you to obtain alternative criteria in the circuit space of which serious estimates are made for matrix operators

Calculations for which one of its components is separated from the mixture is one of the most important types of calculations transferred for concentration
However, judging by school practice, many students do not know the elementary technique for solving such reports, express themselves in identifying and constructing equations in accordance with the calculation of relations between given and exquisite values ​ ​
In our opinion, one of the main reasons is the lack of attention on the part of teachers of mathematics to effective methods of solving this type of calculations.

DECORATIVE ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS
The article provides that for the anisotropic properties of soil, for example, in areas with strong shells of the sedimentary layer, the coefficient Γ of anisotropy plays a key role
Therefore, the impedance value of the electric type wave depends on the value of the anisotropy coefficient Γ
Impedance is a complex criterion in which you can distinguish a specific and false part of the impedance
This dependence is investigated, that is, a quantitative analysis of magnetic impedance type senses a parametric dependence on the anisotropy coefficient in an anisotropic medium; a mathematical experiment was performed to study the sensitivity of the impedance of a special wave depending on the parameters of the medium and wave
Mathematical modeling made it possible to determine the area of ​ ​ special sensitivity of impedants relative to the anisotropy coefficient and wave parameters

ISSUES OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN:
TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MATHEMATICAL SUPPORT OF "EXCELLENT STRATEGIES"
It is shown that it is possible to ensure a sharp increase in the quality of higher education in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Its basis is the informal exchange of scientific and technical information between students
It is shown that in conditions of purposeful strengthening of such exchange, students involved in scientific and technical activities can grow rapidly at the level of training (analogue of phase transition)
This was achieved in connection with the expansion of those who work in the preparation of dissertations by undergraduates, as well as the systematic introduction of an interdisciplinary approach and inter-university cooperation
When working on the topic of a master's thesis, consisting of an isolated "Scientific Group" of a master's student and his supervisor, respectively, the state of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the era of the fourth technological revolution is not considered favorable in this historical period
To prove this formulation, a sequential mathematical model will be created
Preliminary calculations were made at a very low level of classroom quality, showing that it is possible to ensure high quality of higher education

In recent years, serious calculations for various classes of quasi-state operators have been intensively studied, that is, they are used in the study of resistance properties from Lebesgue weight space to local Morry space, as well as in the study of bisecond operators in massive Lebesgue space
The discrete state of quasi-state inequalities is an open question
In this work, we consider a serious inequality for one class of a quasi-second discrete operator, namely the weighted price of the iteration of a discrete Hardy operator in the space of weight chains
As a rule, the imbalance with the iteration of the discrete Hardy operator is considered difficult to estimate, since it contains three independent weight chains and three parameters of different ratios

The article provides for the orientation of "three-dimensional space" "object search task" and "using coordinates"
3D primitives form the basis of many computer graphics software packages and provide the ability to create various objects of a simple form
In most cases, three-dimensional primitives must be combined or transformed to form the desired model
There are many industries that use 3D modeling and animation
For example, when testing 3D Studio MAX, users did a lot of work using this program in various areas: from creating static advertising and dynamic screensavers for television channels to emergency modeling and 3D animation
3D graphics and animation occupy a special place among computer technologies, since they can not only make electronic transfers of web pages live and spectacular presentations and slideshows, but also draw the attention of viewers to any important fragments of them
However, traditional 3D modeling packages are difficult to master and use, and at the same time very expensive
At the same time, creating static and animated volumetric elements in them requires a lot of work and a variety of knowledge - it is necessary to build a skeleton representation of the model, and then create a volumetric illusion by manipulating shadow and light by applying specially created materials to the digital frame, and at the last stage animate scene objects
Therefore, the development of 3D objects and their animation are usually the prerogative of professionals

The article provides for a secondary semicircular equation, which is a quasi-second generalization of the discrete Sturm-Liouville equation
Its continuous analogue, that is, the secondary semiconductor differential equation is associated with the p-Laplacian equation, which is important in plasma physics
If in the P-Laplacian equation all coefficients depend on a radial variable, we obtain a secondary hemispherical differential equation when it dissolves into a radial variable in the p-Laplacian equation
In addition, this class of equations has many digital applications in various areas of analysis
Therefore, the various properties of secondary hemispherical differentiated equations are well studied.
We study some local actions of the solution of the secondary semicircular equation considered here, namely the resistance and non-solvability of the secondary semicircular equation in a given discrete interval
These properties of the equation are proved based on the fulfillment of the Hardy inequality with any discrete weight

A circular plate with a primary curve is widely used as a structural element, the calculation of which leads to many questions related to the design of flexible connections of the axes of round fundamental plates with turbine disks
The nonlinear theory of circular flexible plates provides the key to explaining the process of stability loss, often leading to complete destruction of the structure
Therefore, there is a high demand for analytical methods for solving reports on the calculation of the stress-strain state of circular flexible plates taking into account the primary curvature
These calculations are mathematically characterized by variables of coefficients of differential equations, the exact solution of which is usually absent
Therefore, the creation of analytical solutions to these problems is very relevant

ON THE EQUIVALENCE OF CERTAIN SEAS TO BE INTEGRATED
In this work (1 + 1) there is a nonlinear Schrödinger equation and its generalized (2 + 1) - measuring equation, as well as the Davy-Stewartson equation
Integrable systems have interesting geometric and calibration-invariant properties, and also play an important role in nanophysics in applied magnetism
Nonlinear equations are integrated through a linear system by backtracking
For each integrable nonlinear equation, there is a Lux pair consisting of two linear equations
The compatibility condition of these two linear equations, that is, the zero curve condition, sets the primary nonlinear equation
Batch pairs can be written in operator and matrix form
Here, the matrix form of Lux pairs of nonlinear Schrödinger and Devi-Stuartson equations, as well as the Heisenberg ferromagnetic equation and the Ishimori model equivalent to the caliber of these equations, are studied.

In this article, the location of a holonomic mechanical system of degree of freedom is determined using generalized coordinates of any time
In this case, for a system of degree of freedom, the second type of Lagrange equation is determined by a generalized force corresponding to a force with a potential leading to a given coordinate
To construct the second type of lagrange equation, you must first know the expression of the kinetic and potential energy of small oscillations of the system
By small oscillations near the equilibrium point of the system is meant a generalized coordinate and a generalized speed of determining the place of the system based on the place of stable equilibrium, which allows us to consider it as the first one-time small value at any time
We limit ourselves to the first constant term in equality, since it is provided that the system deviates from equilibrium by a smaller amount
The potential energy expression obtained for the first-order degree of freedom system can be applied to the calculation of the potential energy of the system creating smaller vibrations around the equilibrium point, and the inertia coefficients and stiffness coefficients are directly?
To obtain the differential equation of motion of the system, we use the second type of Lagrange equation

One such case is the use of invariant properties
The article provides detailed methods and methods for solving equations and their systems that depend on one parameter using these invariant properties.

If in the traditional presentation of this topic there are complex roots of the characteristic equation of the differential equation, the corresponding independent solutions of the differential equation are built based on the elements of the complex analysis
As a result, in such cases, the theory of linear differential equations is introduced into the curricula, and for students of specialties in which the theory of complex analysis is not introduced, types of independent solutions are transferred as an unreasonably known fact or only for these cases elements of preliminary complex analysis are transmitted

The development of modern science and technology requires a clear and comprehensive study of mathematical models of physical and hydrodynamic phenomena of the entire environment
For example, experimental studies have shown that the presence in viscous liquids of a very small amount of solutions has a significant effect on the fall of the liquid
Compared to the physical characteristics of water and weak aqueous solutions whose density and viscosity were the same, it was found that their relaxation properties immediately differ significantly
In recent years, the study of qualitative properties of solving problems for pseudo-parabolic equations, such as disruption and stabilization over time, asymptotic change of a large time value, has been intensively developing.
This is evidenced by articles published in world ranking magazines
The proposed work is designed to study one mathematical model of a one-dimensional Kelvin-Foigt fluid taking into account the complex rheological properties characterized by the nonlinear pseudo-parabolic equation p-Laplacian (Sobolev-type equation)
The change in the linear type of pseudo-parabolic equations began with the work of Sobolev
In this work, an asymptotic change in the solution of the pseudo-parabolic equation in a significant value of time is considered, namely, the expansion and power decline of the solution
Pseudo-parabolic equation generalized solution of energy properties change of large time value

and Sapin A
Methods for predicting mortality rates have been developed and their impact on public pension payments assessed
The results showed a decrease in the mortality rate in Kazakhstan and, in this regard, an increase in the life expectancy of people who retired
And this directly affects pension expenses from the state
From 2019 to 2025, state spending on pensions in Kazakhstan will gradually increase, which will affect the gradual reduction of mortality
However, according to the forecast, the share of pension expenses by the state in IPP will decrease from 2021 to 2024
Additional spending on state pension payments due to a decrease in mortality will gradually increase as a share of GDP and reach 002% by 2024

Electrical connection diagram at the substation shall provide automation of reliable power supply and economical operating features in the network
Therefore, in this article, the main electrical installations were selected, which are designed for the electrical diagram of the substation of the Kentau Transformer Plant
To select and check the substation electrical installations, a scheme for calculating short-circuit currents with determination of three-phase short-circuit currents has been developed
The main factors in the selection of the electrical circuit of the high voltage switchgear are the reliability of the power supply and the prospects for development
It is also necessary to check and test the switches
In our case, we have four connections: two communication lines with power grids and two transformers
Several typical diagrams are allowed for this number of connections: rectangular hexagonal bridge diagrams
Switchgears of Kentau Transformer Plant substation are connected by transformers according to block diagram
Electrical installations at power consumption points are connected to the transformer mains unit or they receive backup power from another substation, since in case of failure of one line, two transformers cannot work with the rest of the mains
Therefore, it is proposed to change the electrical circuit taking into account the prospects for the development of the substation device and replace it with a bridge circuit convenient for more reliable flexible automation and eliminating power outages in case of an accident on one of the bus component systems

INVESTIGATION AND SIMULATION OF FLUID MOTION WITH CHANGED VOLUMES AND DIMENSIONS
Liquid is a physical body with accumulator properties, therefore it does not have an independent shape and has the shape of a dish filled with it
Liquids are divided into droplets and gases into two types
Droplet liquids are characterized by high resistance to compression (not fully compressed), as well as tightening between liquid particles with low resistance to contacts and tension due to low frictional force
Incompressible fluid is a mathematical model of an integral environment in which density is maintained when pressure changes
In determining the incompressible liquid, the basic properties of the liquid are preserved, in particular, the position in the constant volume can be changed
This paper presents an experiment reflecting two types of incompressible fluid
The first type is the movement of fluid without changing volume due to chronic deformation
The second type is the formation of a liquid from a liquid, which, when increased, acquires additional kinetic energy
Formulas are provided for calculating and modeling the state

This is the work of al-Farabi as a scientist and personality about his philosophical and mathematical works and the fundamental attitude to life and science as a classification of science and science (counting sciences), and here Al-Farabi combined theory and practice into a single whole.
A scientist must be not only the creator of scientific ideas, but also a person of humanism in society
His main ideological platform was philosophy and logic
And, as the Arabic says,
He reached the great Greek philosophers Aristotle (the first teacher) and Plato
And the fact that al-Farabi became the "second teacher" is not accidental, and this is due to the fact that he deeply absorbed Greek philosophical knowledge when he needed to give an excellent explanation.

STABILITY ISSUES OF NON-STATIONARY SYSTEMS OVER TIME
When we study various trends occurring specifically, we may encounter the concept of the stability of the movement - one of the important concepts
The foundations of the theory of stability of movement were laid at the end of the last century by the great Russian scientist A.
Lyapunov
The stability of the known Lyapunov is considered in an infinite period of time, which is a big obstacle for many applications, since most objects of study work in a limited time range
The concept of stability introduced over an infinite period of time cannot be used to evaluate the properties of motion over a limited period of time
The study of motion stability by analyzing the solutions of the corresponding equations will be acceptable and significant only under conditions of complete sufficiency of the mathematical model of physical accuracy
The purpose of the work is to study the stability of movement of non-linear systems over a limited period of time
Differential equations of motion of fundamental matrix oscillations with limited range interval of non-stationary systems with line of motion stability

Friction is one type of body interaction
Friction occurs when two bodies contact
Forces acting between surfaces of touching solids are called dry friction forces
They are always oriented to touching surfaces, and the friction of silence is divided into forces of sliding friction and sliding friction
Friction force depends on many factors affecting the motion of bodies in the presence of a friction process
In this regard, the description of friction forces is possible only with the help of laws discovered empirically, which are often coarse
Quietness force is an unstable value that can vary from zero to maximum
When a force exceeding the frictional force of calm enters the body, the body moves from the place
The article provides examples of movement, which are interpreted as the driving force of friction
The nature of resting forces and domain friction is analyzed from the point of view of modern physical materials science

DEFORMATION IMPACT WITH MULTIFACETED UNIT
In this work, quantitative calculations were carried out according to a one-time scheme
Analysis of quantitative results: one of the important issues of interaction is determining the duration of body impacts
Ideal smooth impact boundary conditions are used to study the process of complete disturbance of mechanical connection (formation of rupture zone)
Analysis of the dynamics of communication resistance showed that its magnitude and features of evolution depend on the geometric and physical-mechanical parameters of the deformable system in time, as well as on the type of boundary conditions
Increased acoustic toughness of impacts results in increased amplitude and duration of impacts
The impact of a weak hard die or the presence of a shielding layer of polymer material in the barrier reduces the contact resistance of the plate, but the force interaction between the shock bodies becomes longer
Analysis of the results shows that the evolution of contact stresses is characterized by a number of distinctive features
For example, cylinder height and
the direct correlation between time of full difference from obstacles is observed, at function  k t 
corresponds to zero
Increasing the acoustic stiffness of the gusts leads to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the total resistance and the length of the contact effect

Functional and graphic lines are one of the main in the teaching methodology of the course of mathematics
The priority of this line - the study of other important lines of mathematics is carried out through the prism of the concept of function
As you know, based on the experience of teaching mathematics, the concept of function is abstract and very difficult for students to perceive
Therefore, in order to enhance the visualization of investigated objects and concepts in the implementation of a functional-graphic network, it is necessary to increase the consideration of the system of calculations of physical content in order to understand and study the functions of students
In the school algebraic course, the functional-graphic method is rarely used in solving a system of two-digit equations, as well as in solving equations of the same type
The article provides for the output of physical content reports when teaching a system of linear equations with two variables in a school course of algebra
It focuses on cases when the envisaged reports of physical content are interconnected with the content of functional-graphic networks passing in algebra, and allow to disclose the practical content of the topic under consideration for deepening
The calculations of physical content proposed in the article are designed to study the functions of linear functions of algebra and their graphics and the constructive solution of the system of equations and equations associated with these functions

ABLOWITZ-MUSLIM NOT LOCAL NON-LINEAR DEMINING OF TWO SYMMETRY TREATY-BASED MEASUREMENTS
The nonlinear Schrödinger equation is a nonlinear independent differential and integrable equation in which relativistic quantum mechanics plays an important role in many fields of physics, such as acoustics and optics.
In this article, based on the Ablowitz-Musslimani ideas, the Schrödinger equation, a two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation consisting of inverse-time fields in nonlinear terms, was published.
The Schrödinger equation, not locally linear, takes a set of good properties that have the classical nonlinear Schrödinger equation: PT symmetry of the Lux pair and an infinite set of conservation laws
For the non-two-dimensional Schrödinger equation, the Darbu transform method is applied
Lax's proposal based on this method allows us to obtain a spectrum of N-type solutions with spectral parameters
Specific solutions of the Schrödinger equation are obtained, which is not a two-dimensional local nonlinear
A graphical representation of solutions obtained using various parameters is also built.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS OF OCEAN ACCOUNTING BY AREA METHODS
Mathematical models of ocean accounting are equations of the Navier-Stokes type, the construction of stable efficient algorithms for solving them, the presence of certain contractual issues associated with certain difficulties, integral-differential relations, etc.
In practice, differentiated methods for solving ocean accounting problems are widely used, but there is no work to theoretically study the stability and convergence of the applied algorithms
In most cases stability and convergence tests are established by calculation experiments
Therefore, we believe that ocean accounting is an urgent problem of mathematics for constructing convergent methods for solving a system of equations and calculating mathematical justification
The paper investigated variants of the false method of the region for a non-linear ocean model

In this work, within the framework of the cluster model, two nucleon-nucleon potentials were used to calculate the dynamic collision reaction of two alpha-alpha particles with the formation of an 8Be nucleus living in a short time
The cluster model method is also used for theoretical analysis and solving the specified problem.
One such model is a microscopic cluster model or model known as the algebraic version of the Resonant Group Method (RTAAN), which allows you to study this problem in a new way and get information about resonant states
The advantage of this method is that the Pauli principle also takes into account the internal structure of interacting clusters
To study this issue, two semi-legal nucleon-nucleon potentials were selected: a modified Khasegava-Nagat potential and a second version of the Volkov potential
Each potential has its own unique characteristics and exchange parameters, which allows for a more detailed consideration of the proposed issue.
According to the results of performed works with application of two nucleon-nucleon potentials, width of resonant state G and energy E are compared with available experimental data
Comparisons resulted in a correspondence between theory and experiment

Automatic word recognition (ACP) systems use GMM-HMM for acoustic modeling and n-gram for language modeling
Over the past decade, the deeply oriented neural network (DFNN) has almost completely changed in acoustic modeling the unknown parameters of the GMM distribution in mathematical statistics and econometry and the method for evaluating econometric models
Modern automatic recognition systems are based mainly on the DFNN-HMM acoustic model and n-gram (LM) sample
Language models based on repetitive neural network (RNN) are reported to give n-gram lower ambiguity than language samples due to the ability to model a long-term short-term context
In this paper based on these papers, we study acoustic simulations based on long short-term memory combined on a sample language based on a repeating neural network for automatic speech recognition of children
Experimental results show that simulations based on such a combined repetitive neural network are effective in appropriate and inappropriate tasks of automatic speech recognition by children

The article provides for the peculiarities of computer modeling of diffraction and interference phenomena
Mathcad is ideal for modeling and visualizing different optical phenomena
These phenomena include diffraction in the slit
The phenomenon of diffraction is well studied and the formulas describing it are given in the section of physics optics
A visual diffraction model using these formulas was originally created for two-dimensional conditions
Based on this model, a graph is drawn that can clearly reflect the change in illumination intensity in the gap section
The level of visualization of the diffraction phenomenon is increased into a three-dimensional state and is shown in graphic form
The intense light curve indicated in the plane according to the assumed assumptions is appropriate in any section of the surface in space and the intensity of lighting is characterized by the height of the surface
In other words, the light intensity is constant along the length of the gap section, and the extreme effects at the ends of the gaps are not taken into account within the created model
Observing light through a small hole, we see interference rings called Newton rings
It is easy to take into account that the intensity of light is maximum in the center of the ring and as it is removed, it feels fluctuating

It is emphasized that this method does not require calculating the extremum of a function and is based on the monotonicity of a linear function in any section
Therefore, a modern student should not only know the derivative solution of reports transmitted to the extreme, but also be armed with elements of their solution
Reports reported to extreme extremum, reports of extremum related to linear function of linear function

APPLICATION OF COMPILING MATHEMATICAL SYSTEMS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL
Much attention is now being paid to computer technology in education
Teachers should learn not only classical forms of learning, but also new ways of teaching disciplines using computers and computer technology
Of particular interest are computer mathematical systems that solve many problems of an applied nature.
We decided to study the question of whether these systems will be used in the study of mathematics in high school courses
Having read the various sources of information during the study, we came to the conclusion that this issue is very controversial
In the form of an experiment with mathematics teachers who completed a training workshop on the basics of working with the Mathcad package, we conducted our own research
At the end of the seminar, teachers conducted practical classes in their classrooms and gave an objective conclusion on the use of the MathCad package in teaching mathematics
The application of computer mathematics systems complies with basic didactic principles
Therefore, they can be used in secondary school courses
