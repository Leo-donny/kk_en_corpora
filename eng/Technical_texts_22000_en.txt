Summary
The article deals with the distribution of river waters of the Aral Sea basin; comprehensive issues of the life of the population of the regions of Kazakhstan belonging to the Aral Sea and their causes; Cross-border environmental control policies and linkages with the economy; Ways out of cross-border socio-economic and environmental exclusion; The Central Asian States do not work within the framework of international legislation and institutions that control water cooperation, therefore it is one of the ways to solve interstate everyday problems.
However, instability in the distribution of ships, the absence of long-term plans for the use of water, fuels the environmental situation and limits the cessation of economic development and the satisfaction of the country's own moral and material needs for sustainable life and the right to health
The article will present the idea of the International Bank for Transboundary Rivers (ICB)
The interest of Central Asian countries in the use of the Syr Darya River should be the basis for the principles of inter-water communication
It is also impossible to abandon administrative methods if their purpose and direction of tasks meet the corresponding requirements
However, since these requirements have not yet reached a high level in the countries of Central Asia, administrative methods should still be used as an additional method of interstate relations and over time the city should go beyond the application
In this regard, it is necessary to determine the choice of administrative and market methods for the use and protection of water resources, which are the most important in the task of creating a mechanism for international economic relations

Words: etymology semantics geographical names microtoponyms, hydronyms phytonyms transcriptional geographical objects landscape
In 1813, the traveler F. visited the Kazakh land.
Nazarov's guides describe many geographical objects for which valuable toponymic data are given
His records show that the traveler paid special attention to especially local microtopons: Kara- tomar Kokterek Saryagash Zhuzkamys Shubaraigyr Masakkamys Toreigyr Akmola Zhylanda [1]
He gave translations of the names of Kokshetau Karatau Arystanau Sholakasu in order to explain to the Russian reader the meaning of oronyms on Kazakh land
A traveler named Boraldai, who currently has a lot of controversy on transcription and etymology
in the version of "Buraltai"
This, in turn, will serve as the basis for the original version of the name to be Turning
The traveler paid special attention to the legend that the ship of the prophet Nuk remained at the head of Kazygurt
Nazarov's work provides data on the rivers Nura Yesil Kulanntpes Shu Arys Badam Keles
Despite distortion of some names, F
Data left by Nazarov are important for regional toponymic studies
Prominent scientist E.
Eversmann left very valuable data on Ustirt
In general, the first introduction of the name "Ustirt" in Russian scientific literature served as an impetus for the subsequent stabilization of this name by manuscripts of this scientist
According to Eversman, in this region a smooth high is called Ustirt (in the meaning of "surface of the earth"), since on the southern plain inhabited by the Karakalpaks, in the opposite sense, the name Asturt is given ("lowland")
Our topological "Ustirt" was originally used as a pathetic name in relation to a specific geographical object and subsequently became a common name (term)
We also drew attention to Eversman's data on the meaning and pronunciation of the local geographical term in the form of "chink" in Russian scientific works and decided to give it in the Russian version in order to be clear:
In his scientific report, which was included in the materials of the expedition called the "Naturological Journal," along with the commentary on many geographical phenomena, an overview of the meaning of local names was made
The scientist gave data on the presence of numerous bays and lakes at the mouth of the Jam River
"Strong winds in winter with Zhalatyrmuz Bay blow snow, so cattle glide along an even ice surface, so this bay is called Zhaltamyz" [2 137-b
The scientist wrote that local Kazakhs call this place and Evil because of this inconvenience
In the work of the scientist, it can be noted that in comparison with Russian scientists of that period, the Russian transcription of the names of geographical objects in Ustirta is also most correctly represented.
Scientific Russian scientific literature bears the Kazakh name of the river, which is given the name "Emba"
He clarified that this is a "jam"
During a survey of data on the name of the Sagiz River, Eversman found out that the name of the river is due to the fact that resins stand out from sandstone at the source of the Sagiz River in the heat of summer
The expedition materials say that the name Uyala refers to numerous groups of geese and squirrels nesting here, and the names of the adjacent mountains of Zheltau and Shadows are explained by the features of the local climate
A group of names compiled on the basis of the determinants "good-bad" "tentek" is given in accordance with the principle of economic assessment of geographical objects of Kazakhs (Zhaksyn Esenzhal Zak Esenzhal Tentexor)
In their notes, the expedition members pointed out that the Tentexor pump in this region consists of impenetrable mud, and the Tastikudyk mountain well is riddled with stone, that on the place called Shuryk there are dozens of wells that sound far from the source called Kurkirauik.
Valuable evidence in relation to the positions of the nomination is also the introduction of the names of wells exhibited by the nomadic Kazakh for orientation in space (Sher Taskayu Middle Transportation Arch)
Under the leadership of Negri in 1820-1821 he was part of the diplomatic mission in Bukhara.
Meyendorf left important toponymic data on the territories of the north-west and south-west of Kazakhstan
In his records published as a separate scientific work, the traveler tried to compare the names of geographical objects in Kazakh with local natural conditions
"Kyrgyz (Kazakhs - K.
) assigns special names to places that have come into view
For example, Mount Zhamantau south of Aytyktau, and the northern - Dzhaksy- tau
On the slopes of the former, little grass grows, on the latter - good pasture and water "[3 32-b
Also E
Meyendorf argued that the peak of Mount Mugalzhar can be interpreted in two meanings: firstly, this name is named in the meaning of "alone," because it stands much higher than others; secondly, it can give the value "difference" because it consists of two vertices
The conclusions of the Russian traveler about the name of the Kyzylkum desert have not yet lost significance for the toponymy of Kazakhstan
His records contain very important geographical data on Syr Darya Zhanadaria and Kuangdaria
He noted that the eternal snowy parts and deserted mountains of the Kazakhs are called "Alatau" because of the series of black and white
E, which thus accumulated special significance for the meaning and spelling of local geographical names
Meyendorf noted the presence of numerous distortions on Russian maps [3 70-b
This proves the traveler's interest in knowing the diversity of landscapes of Kazakh land and the classified nature of local geographical terminology
Famous Russian historian A.
Levshin gave a geographical description of the Kazakh land in section 1 of his work "Description of Kyrgyz-Kazakh or Kyrgyz-Kaisak steppes" (1832) [4]
Toponymic studies of this work
We see the meaning for this in the following:
The work focused on the meaning of their names when compiling a description of geographical objects in Kazakhstan
It is especially important that the toponymic data of the scientist regarding the names of Sasykkol Tobol Terisakkan Amankaragai Temir and other names give the historical name of Lake Zaysan "Zaysan-Nor" Shar River "Char-Gurban" Alakol "
Data on forest land on Kazakh land are presented on the basis of references to historical materials
The work presents information on forests Amankaragai Arakaragai Zhabykkaragai Ortakaragai Nauryzym
As you know, the Kazakh people called coniferous forests common "pine," "wooden" - ponds consisting of small leaves
If so, then
data can be used in toponymic landscape restoration studies
Since Levshin's description of geographical objects dates back two centuries, we assume the beginning of the study of some toponyms, the reasons for which are currently unclear
Information about a large number of islands in the Aral Sea, especially along the Tobol River, where corals live on Mount Bugyla.
In 1839, E.
Kovalevsky's records have a special interest in Kazakh names
It is especially surprising that the traveler concludes that a copper deposit can be discovered here, which is based on its very name.
Famous Russian scientist A.
Maksheev has repeatedly been on Kazakh soil
Described during his first trip of 1848 in many geographical objects of the Syr Darya and the Aral region
His writings show that the scientist is fond of knowing the meaning of local names
He named the two most suitable crossings on the Syr Darya River (Amanntkel Hanntkel)
There is evidence that Lake Kamystybas, which allocates Lake Kamystybas due to the large number of Kulanda Peninsula, is called Karaboget for most of the reeds [6]
Next A
The analysis of Maksheev on the names of Kazakh land, presented on a map compiled by Swedish Renat in the 18th century, also indicates that the scientist was very respectful of Kazakh names, attaching importance to the peculiarities of their spelling [7]
In the second half of the XIX century, on behalf of the Russian Geographical Society, he explored the Kazakh land N.
Severtsov's work on these journeys also contains geographical and toponymic data [8]
Especially important for historical geography and toponymic research is the description of the settlement of Mynbulak on the banks of the Bilikol River, in which the Kulansu River was mentioned in Chinese sources as information about the Kulan ridge in the Karatau system.
The scientist's thoughts on the traditions of using and protecting the nature of Kazakhs, of course, form such an attitude to the origin of "saints" on our land
Because this work proves that our people had a tradition of involving nature in its special forms
This tradition of pyritania, which began with the ancient Turks, forbade the destruction of rare forest lands requiring protection by assigning "holy" names
Traveling on Lake Balkhash and the Zhetysu region, A.
Nikolsky's records reflect the natural conditions of this territory in the 80s of the XIX century [9]
The scientist assessed Kazakhs as knowledgeable naturalists and noted that they pay attention primarily to economically significant natural objects and phenomena
This work presents data on the Tartubek Peninsula Kentubek Koktubek Aktubek
As you know, under the general "peninsula" Kazakhs call part of the land flowing into the reservoir
It has long entered scientific circulation as a term
Nevertheless, we have known since childhood that Kazakhs living in the foothills of the southeast call the "peninsula" all the suitable part for hayfields on the banks of the lake river
There is no doubt that in the work of Nikolsky there is a name for hayfields, except for the first of these peninsula
The scientist's data on the countless cokes at the mouth of the Bakanas of the Koksu and Karatal rivers, in which small Balyktykol fish, in which dense poplars and showy ponds pass into the Genghisau process in the Juzagash river valley near Balkhash, how much the natural complexes of this region have changed over the past 120 years
These data can serve as a source of etymology of indigenous names in the region
For example, the original meaning of the Prisoner's name can be explained by the following scholar's data:
"Arrested forests are very dense and difficult to pass" [9 57-b
From here A
As Nikolsky painted, because of the inaccessibility of this place, the nomad Cossack called this place Kamau
You have witnessed many times that geographical names that can be regarded as the cultural heritage of our people at the moments when you witnessed that history
Without writing down such a rich heritage anywhere, you experience the miracles of a people who have kept it conscious for centuries
Famous British historian J.
To which Toynbee replied: "Only cattle could master the dry steppe, but in order to live and develop, the nomad is his own
constantly learn new skills, as well as develop special moral and mental abilities "[10 185-p
We are confident that in general toponymic data, which are often found in travelers' guides and researchers' works, will allow you to analyze the exact meaning of geographical names and the conditions for their occurrence
Keywords: Arid zone of anthropogenic factor desert natural erosion landscape
Desertification is a global issue that is difficult to address not only in individual countries but also at the global level
A combination of natural and anthropogenic processes leading to disequilibrium in the desert oecosystem and degradation of all forms of organic life in a certain territory
Also, loss of vegetation cover that does not return to place without the participation of natural ecosystems
Water use mainly due to natural and mainly anthropogenic factors in wet-deficient areas (uninterrupted use of forest crops in pasture irrigation)
appears
Desertification occurs in all natural zones of the world [1]
Currently, the main cause of desertification in different countries of the world is the inconsistency of the structure of economic use of natural resources with the natural capabilities of this landscape, population growth, increased anthropogenic pressure, the low socio-economic situation of some countries
According to the UN for 1985, even then the volume of anthropogenic desertification reached 9 million km ² and annually comes out of land use 7 million hectares
Desertification accounts for 10 per cent of total land in Asia - 19 per cent in Africa - 23 per cent in Australia - 45 per cent in South America
Sahara Desert moves south at an average speed of 6 km/year
Desertification - the appearance of landscapes similar to desert with vegetation under the influence of human economic activity
Dunezhuz
Desertification, linked to climate change and its growing joy, is well under way
As a result of desertification, the biological product and species begin to depreciate
Currently, soil fertility in 1/3 of the land surface
1/5 of the world's population may suffer
Over the past 50 years, more than 800 million hectares of land have been desertification in the world
Most of it is from the African continent
For example, scientists who have extended about 650-700 km to sub-Saharan Africa predict that 60 million South Africans will be forced to relocate to areas other than their name in 2020 due to desertification of suitable land
In the mountainous regions of Central Asia around the Aral Sea and Balkhash, there is an intense process of desertification, including high-zone geosystems of Central Asia and Southern Kazakhstan (Tian-Shan Pamir-Alai)
The use of the waters of the Amudaria and Syr Darya rivers for agriculture led to the appearance of saline plains in the waterless areas of the Aral Sea
The degradation of landscapes around the Aral Sea is also accompanied by the exchange of lake-marsh and tugai natural complexes for halo-xerophytic
The desert zone of the Kazakh state is a landscape caused by both the physical and geographical state of nature and the result of human actions
The geographical location of Kazakhstan covers 4 natural zones: steppe desert with forest
These zones belong to regions as natural landscape zones emerging in general geographical science
Formation of zone B
Great scientists like Berg have researched
Berg considered the transition zones between these zones and divided the latitudinal zones into provinces depending on the geological tectonic orographic features
The boundaries of these zones have changed to date
The main reason is that society is directly related to the development of the economy and the influence of human actions
Global environmental problems caused by human actions are caused by increased technological pressures on the environment
Desertification is therefore increasing
For Kazakhstan, most of whose territory is on the territory of insufficient humidification, two thirds of the country is exposed to different levels of desertification (about 70% of the total land)
Its formation is affected by aridity of climate, deflation of soils, salinization of soil, as well as pollution of land by various chemicals
The complication of its further development is directly related to human actions
The deserted main zones of the lands of Kazakhstan East Kazakhstan (Semipalatinsk region) Almaty region (near Lake Balkhash) Kyzylorda region (Aral) Mangistau region (Zhezkazgan region) leads to a complication of the huge relationship between man and society today
The planetary regional distribution of our anthropogenic landscapes is due to the fact that their classification is not included in the same system
There is no systemic opinion among scientists about changing the boundaries of the highland natural landscapes of the steppe desert, of which we know
Even works and textbooks about the landscape written by scientists do not mention the consequences of classifying an anthropogenic landscape
From this it follows that there are not enough scientific and theoretical concepts of the formation of an anthropogenic landscape in a wide range
In Western Kazakhstan, where 30% of the land of Northern Kazakhstan is unsuitable, 100 million hectares of pastures with technogenic pollution of 25 thousand hectares of oil and gas industrial products are eliminated
In particular, 14 million hectares of land occupied by the Azgyr and Taisoigan landfills are contaminated with radioactive waste
Flooding of 268 million hectares of the coast of the Caspian Sea continues to be contaminated with petroleum products (the decrease in seals periodically disappears)
Number of unsuitable places increases in Central Kazakhstan
Soil impairment by man-made pollution in rivers is high in pasture wear and pollution by rocket and space waste (in Betpakdal)
In South Kazakhstan region, 2 million hectares of desert soils of Amu Darya and Syr Darya irreversibly destroy the ecosystem of salts flying from the Aral ridge
The formation of a new anthropogenic landscape is also observed at the global level
For example, test explosions in Japan Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the United States in Nevada
300 million tenge in this region
pity that the saxaul per ha was destroyed
Pollution of the environment by uranium deposits Aral Sozak Sholakkorgan is a manifestation of the anthropogenic landscape
The formation of a new anthropogenic landscape is also observed at the global level
For example, an atomic explosion in Colorado in Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in America
In the Balkhash-Alakol district of Shu-Moyinkum, the anthropogenic landscape is increasing, the arid construction of the Kapshagai Tasotkel reservoir led to the degradation of irrigated land
Also in the East Kazakhstan region large-colored metal deposits of tungsten uranium copper zinc pose a danger to residents of settlements and cities
The main difference between an anthropogenic landscape and natural landscapes is that the natural landscape itself is regulated and connected to each other, the anthropogenic landscape is not restored or goes long for self-regulation
Therefore, in order to restore the anthropogenic landscape, man needs to systematically use natural components effectively
Desert steppe zone is used slightly for agriculture
Here they are mainly engaged in agriculture only on bright pink soil
Sheep breeding and horse breeding prevail in the desert
Vegetable gardens will be planted in irrigated places
Barsakelmes Ustirt state reserves organized in desert zone
The forest area of ​ ​ the republic is only 46% of the total territory
This indicator, including saxaul lands, forest pastures and bush ponds
The actual forest cover when only trees are included in the forest is 23%
The rarity of forests is observed in the forests of Rudny and Southern Altai, where over the past 40 years the yield of coniferous forests has decreased by 7% - by 13%
The area of ​ ​ apple forests growing in Zhetysu and Iliysky Alatau decreased by 24% [2]
In the region of 50 million hectares of Kazakhstan there are hayfields
Haymaking area shrinks due to desertification
Suppression of them by weeds indicates the complete or partial death of shrubs, both resource and water-regulating role of meadow plants
Desertification of soils caused by wind erosion in Kazakhstan covered semi-desert and desert landscapes with gentle dry steppes
Due to wind erosion, soil impairment occurs
From the action of winds in sown lands, the pupil content decreases, carbonate increases, agrochemical and water-physical properties deteriorate
To date, Kazakhstan has forecasts of weak deflation in crops due to its reduction
Increased risk of increased land erosion in arid regions of the republic, especially in heavily worn pastures
During the implementation of the program for the expansion of irrigated land, massive areas of pumped and saline soils for irrigation decreased
Among the water and environmental problems of the regions in volume irrigation, the issue of uninterrupted use of water is on the agenda
This is due to the lack of economic stimulus and a tradition of saving aquifer technologies
Non-calculation of irrigation was the main cause of salinization and erosion of water, and sewage consumption led to pesticide contamination of rivers and high mineralization
The feat of a world-class planetary anthropogenic landscape is a big question that all mankind today faces due to a sharp change in the balance in the legality of the development of nature
The study of this problem by scientists at the world level turns to environmental science to determine the essence of nature change [3]
Nature protection is, first of all, an increase in the economy of the population, improvement of nature, preservation of the rich heritage for future generations
Every competent member of society cannot be preferred, knowing that these three grounds are a duty to fulfill duties, is not the average treasure of the country

Key words: national innovation system of innovative development innovative economy sustainable innovation economy theory clusters of innovative development theory innovation innovative potential information technology innovation policy
Currently, the main goal of economic development in many countries and regions of the world is to improve the quality of life of the population
Therefore, the process of socio-economic development consists of three important components:
Raising incomes - improving public health and education;
Creation of conditions for the growth of people who can respect themselves as a result of the formation of a socio-political economic and institutional system aimed at respecting human values;
Improving human freedom, including economic freedom 1
Researchers and policymakers often talk about the role of innovation in economic development
Innovation as a term is an alternative to intensive socio-economic development
The Oslo Instruction calls innovation "the application of a new or significantly improved product (product or service) or a new method of marketing the process or a new organizational method in business practice" [2 Art. 31
The American National Science Foundation describes innovation as "an innovation that creates value for society" [3]
Innovative development as a phenomenon of techno-social processes will be associated primarily with the scientific and technical industry
In the modern world, the spatial concentration of innovation increases compared to the concentration of the population and economic activity
In the scientific literature in recent years, the concept of "creative potential of the city" has been formed, considered as a source of innovative urban development
Researchers evaluate creativity as an inexhaustible resource and attach particular importance to the formation of a creative class capable of working in a changing economic situation, which allows creating creative and scientific clusters in cities that preserve an innovative spirit [4]
This question requires a special study in relation to large cities of the Republic of Kazakhstan
One of the most important areas of innovative development theory is cluster theory
One of the first founders of cluster direction N
Kondratyev in his studies showed that innovations appear in groups, that is, clusters, vary in time [5]
In the future, these studies will be
Schumpeter continued
The greatest contribution to the development of cluster theory was made by American scientist Michael Porter
This theory is based on the fact that competitive firms at the international level usually concentrate in one region, and depending on the wave of nature of this innovation cover the most competitive companies and suppliers and their competitive companies
Porter created the most important applied teaching, linking competitiveness with cluster development [6]
The scientist identified 5 main features characterizing the competitiveness of a private country
Countries with moderate macroeconomic performance are considered competitive, such as the absence of a permanent budget deficit, the prevention of currency appreciation by low interest rates
This rule does not apply to all countries: Japan, which is increasingly experiencing budget deficits, is raising Italy's exchange rate, Switzerland is constantly raising the standard of living of the population, which is characteristic of high interest rates.
Countries with lower labour levels will become competitive
One of the factors that influenced the tough move of the new industrial countries to the world market is
Countries with natural resources will become competitive
Nevertheless, this is not a frozen rule: African countries, rich in a variety of resources, which can become prerequisites for economic development: Russia and t.
countries have difficulty accessing the world market for their products
You cannot achieve economic recovery only through the development of natural resources "economists Dutch
disease "
In the 60-70s of the XX century, the Netherlands began to export huge reserves of natural gas
This reduced the country's competitiveness
Since natural gas exports declined due to the exchange rate of the national currency, which led to the containment of the development of other industries, including manufacturing, in the field of industrial services
As a result, deindustrialization took place in the Netherlands, where many industries are developing.
Countries whose governments subsidize selected industries, facilitate imports and support local enterprises are competitive
Nevertheless, this opinion is doubtful: in order to support the export-oriented industries of Japan and the Republic of Korea, it became known that the governments of these countries are being affected by their internal affairs
The competitiveness of the country will depend on various management practices, including the interaction of management and labor
This definition is also inaccurate, because in any country, due to local features, its own relations are formed, which cannot be brought into a single system at the world level
Cluster development will not only increase competitiveness, but also create conditions for innovative adaptation
Therefore, the most successful clusters will appear when entering the "new market" in the field of technology technology and production
The cluster direction is currently used in the creation of large-scale projects mainly in the study of competitive zones (state - a large city) or a certain industry and the development of a large city program
Therefore, this theory is directly related to the development of Almaty and Astana
The concept of creating a national (state) innovation system was laid in the 80s and 90s of the last century
Main compilers of the Concept of creation of the national (state) innovation system K
Nelson (1993) [7]
The concept of the national innovation system is interpreted in the state policy in the field of the development of the innovation system for the compatibility of subjects and objects of innovation that interact in the creation and implementation of innovative products
National innovation systems currently differ from country to country
The Concept of Innovative Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2020, approved by Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated June 4, 2013 No. 579, reflects the main opportunities and predicted scenarios of innovative development, taking into account the provisions of the Strategy "Kazakhstan - 2050: a new policy course of the state"
Here, the country's innovative policy is considered as the foundation for the well-being of citizens and the economic activity of the future national conformity
The fundamental content of the envisaged theories and their construction of policies and strategies for economic development based on innovation are indicated in figure 1
Figure 1 - Methodical path of territorial innovative development
Thus, innovation is one of the factors determining the long-term development of the Territory
Kazakhstan's economy, including the largest cities - Almaty and Astana, is moving to a new stage
The main elements of the innovation system at the state level are:
a system for the synthesis of scientific and technical knowledge;
systems of application and use of scientific and technical knowledge;
Innovation dissemination and support system (government support for innovation, innovation infrastructure, venture capital,
A study of the general patterns of world economic development will allow you to qualitatively assess the further development of the city
The development of the city as a whole is a multidimensional and multidisciplinary process, considered as a set of different social and economic goals
Increasing the importance of science and education during this development forms an innovative economy or neo-economy in large cities
The importance of the innovation system can be described as the complete integrity of interrelated social relations and organizations that transform scientific knowledge into a new competitive product and activity for socio-economic growth
Previously, cities were territories on which innovations related to the transport and energy housing connection of health and life were concentrated
Concentration of mental potential in cities contributes to the rapid realization of many ideas
Cities are now becoming centres of social innovation
The introduction of social innovations determines the strategic development of large cities
Thus, innovation is not only the emergence of new ideas, but also their effective implementation [8]
Sustainable innovative development of the city determines its competitive advantage
Russian scientist T
Sustainable innovative development, according to Tumina, can be called a development option, in which as a result of the introduction of innovations, the system changes from one stable state to another [9]
For this purpose, we note the four main prerequisites characteristic of such innovative cities as Almaty (Figure 2)
Figure 2 - Potential of innovative development
Thus, innovation is not only the main innovation process, but also the development of a whole system of factors and conditions necessary for its implementation.
Requirements for the urban environment change every year
A modern innovative city should become primarily "green," that is, become a comfortable environment for life that meets environmental requirements
Scientists associate the green future with the term "sustainable development" [10]
In this case, the transition to an innovative economy based on education and science will become a kind of trend in urban development
Current trends in strategic urban development by Pricewaterhouse Coopers research will be characteristic of most major cities [8]
These include:
Residents of the city strive for uniqueness, which requires types of information and social activities that take into account the most optimal individual characteristics
The territories of large cities are spatially diverse and large-scale
Therefore, in all areas it has a forced character
This, in turn, requires faster dissemination of information on improving and optimizing transport
High technology extends to all sectors of large cities (health management, transport,
) included
This should be used to provide a comfortable environmentally friendly aesthetic environment for citizens.
Because a modern city with a beautiful safe architecture can give its residents a sense of civic pride in their homeland
In large cities, due to changes in the lifestyle of citizens, fertility rates will sharply decrease and the age of life of a person will increase
In this regard, as the city develops, the number of elderly residents will increase, the proportion of children and youth will decrease
The size of the city is increasing
At the global level, not only the number of residents in the city increases, but also the number of urban areas
This is especially intense in developing countries
This will create your own environment
Climate change is also associated with urban development and the effects of urban lifestyles (increased heat use)
) will depend on
Urbanization contributes to global migration
Migration provides additional opportunities for cities, as well as poses a threat and uncertainty to their social classification
Concentration of innovative development in urban agglomerations leads to rapid development indicators and provides an opportunity for cluster development of advanced industries through targeted investment policies
For example, the Chinese government, which adheres to the policy of accelerated development
More than 100 clusters identified in more than 60 cities since 1995
In this case, the provinces where the largest agglomerations of China are concentrated have the highest rates of production of innovative products (20%) [11]
Considering that in China as a whole this figure is 36%, one can note the key role of agglomeration in the introduction and development of innovation
Spatial agglomeration of economic activity in Kazakhstan also provides support for innovation through economic consolidation and urbanization
Therefore, the development of agglomerations in the country has acquired a state programmatic character
Given the differences between the level and possibilities of socio-economic development between the territory of the country and the cities of its regions, as well as the scientific potential, the issue of creating an innovative system in Kazakhstan cannot be solved only centrally
The active participation of major cities is needed in this process
The main condition for this is the purposeful formation and effective functioning of the innovation system of large cities, created within the framework of the innovation system of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the regions

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN HUMAN BODY FROM CELL PHONE EXPOSURE
Babashev - Professor of KazUPU named after Abay
In recent years, we have made great strides in the development of scientific and technical activities in the country
A lot of vital and affordable technologies have been introduced in society and telecommunications systems have been updated
These innovations for the benefit of mankind, of course, are useful
One way or another, man-made electromagnetic fields with different frequency ranges do not have a negative impact on human health
Especially harmful for cellular communications, experts say
In recent years, a system of mobile radiotelephone (cellular) communication devices has been dynamically developing.
Yesterday in the 80-90s of the last century, a mobile phone was fashionable, but rare
However, the situation has now changed dramatically
Children who proudly go to school, changing into an open-colored phone
Teenagers who change phone models monthly by clothing color
Employees and employees of enterprises and organizations that constantly conduct continuous business conversations can hold several hours of mobile consultations per day
Unlimited limits provided by mobile companies agitate people for continued long-term use of mobile communications
One of the manifestations of the fact that our society, especially young people, is fond of capitalist life is manifested in the impact on their health of the broad areas of new mobile communication with new innovative relations between people
It is obvious that the use of such telecommunication systems by primary school students from morning to evening will cause them to arise in especially difficult conditions
About the occurrence of such cases you do not see scientific literature in studies of the appearance of mobile phones

On June 2, 1875, Graham Bell, a professor at the School of Chechen Art at Boston University, first heard the voice of his assistant using connecting wires
This innovation of the inventor of the Scot remains in history under the name phone
One interesting inventor name in English means "call" [1-3]
About a century later, the first mobile phones appeared
The invention of Martin Cooperding, a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Technology, is now almost half the world's population in the diary [4-5]

RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THEREON
It is already known today that electromagnetic fields very strongly affect all sources of life, including the human body
The results of biological and medical studies have shown that the negative effects of electromagnetic fields on the internal organs of the human nervous system that affect their physiological development are only widely mentioned in all public publications.
At the same time, according to the results of studies conducted jointly with foreign specialists, there were more facts of suicide in cities when hundreds of types of diseases were widespread due to electromagnetic fields.
One of the main reasons for this is that electromagnetic fields, having a strong influence on the construction of the human brain, immediately violate the properties of correct thinking
Currently, electromagnetic fields related to the development of telecommunications are also growing in the Republic of Kazakhstan
For example, in large cities, such as Almaty, in large megacities, where the spread of electromagnetic fields in the country has increased tenfold compared to 1990, including in cities, its number has exceeded normal standards by 1000 times [11]
For example, the stealth of the electromagnetic field wave especially negatively affects the body's protective homeostatus into the central nervous system
Reduced visual memory also negatively affects the development of the genitals and embryo
Sensitivity of the embryo in the maternal abdomen to electromagnetic field waves
it is scientifically proven that higher than higher, therefore long stay of twins in the territory of electromagnetic field overshadows infant with congenital diseases [12-15 24]
Electromagnetic fields today are found in all radio engineering sectors of agricultural medicine
These are linkophone rooms in Internet schools, telecommunication interactive boards and household
Interest in the issue of electromagnetic field (EMF) effects on the human body A
I: Pioneer works of Vernadsky appeared only in the first half of the 20th century
Since the beginning of the 1960s, the flow of information on the effects of scientific and man-made EMF on biological objects has been constantly growing [16]
Electromagnetic fields leaving the electromagnetic mobile phone can "comulatively affect" the human body, but in 5-10 years they will appear
It is possible that the tumor may be a mental illness
Therefore, when using a mobile phone, you should be very careful [17]
Scientists note that "children from 3 to 6 years old should not be given a phone"
Because the electromagnetic field negatively affected the growing brain and worsened the memory of the child
Therefore, specialists regularly check harmful waves emitted from radio engineering objects with density measuring devices
At the same time, the limit of antennas and mobile phones should not exceed 10 microwatts of square centimeters [18]
Accumulated knowledge about the harm of electromagnetic radiation to the human body, other electromagnetic radiation, such as telephone radiation, affects the physiological state of health of people who came into contact with it
There is no doubt that the head located in the irradiation zone of the mobile phone during operation has a significant impact on the brain cap and hearing ability [19-24]
Recent research suggests that long-term radiation can affect the bioelectric activity of some brain structures and negatively affect its work (say, memorization and long-term state)
European scientists have recently drawn the following terrible conclusions:
In a person using a mobile phone for more than 10 years, violation of the brain's blood-brain barriers begins, that is, filter walls that cause the non-use of harmful substances in the brain are erased
This will lead to malignancies in the brain
The paths of our life may not withstand such electromagnetic pressure
Some experts
"the vast majority of people suffer from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's"
However, based on the experience, the researchers concluded that radiation effects not only accumulate, but are also transmitted to subsequent generations.
Within a month, conducting the practice of irradiating atlamans on various mobile phones, two experienced appadansongs demonstrated the immune system of protective lambs in researchers
After that, without taking irradiation of the blood of irradiated atjalmans, control is carried out by sowing "clean" pigs
As a result, the deceased with the whole breed of atjalman [19]
Studies by the European Electronic Components Research Institute have shown that even a small amount of radiation on a mobile phone leads to the "scattering" of hemoglobin fibers
It became known that excessive passion for mobile phones leads to accumulation of stones in the kidneys and cardiovascular diseases
To prove, experts repeatedly examined blood samples and conducted radiation for from 10 to 60 hours
Currently, similar studies in Russia

Identification in the Scientific and Practical Center for Folk Medicine, headed by Chernozubov, during the verification of persons working on a computer 6-8 hours a day, a legitimate phenomenon
The researchers also noted an increase in impotence in men whose pancreas changed in the cerebral vessels, and abortion in women increased dramatically and this coincides entirely with studies of Americans and Swedes in this area
So, we made sure that electromagnetic radiation has little effect on our body, even if we do not see it
Two years ago, the Russian National Committee for Protection against Neon Rays signaled that "the use of mobile phones by two layers of women and young children is causing tremendous harm to their health"
"Mobile phone" - this negatively affects the health of children
Scientists have shown that due to the deterioration of memorable abilities in children, recognition decreases, as well as due to serum and redness in them
Many children very quickly develop a tired nervous breakdown
And in children who long communicate with mobile phones, nervous depressive syndrome is becoming more and more
People communicate by phone in the elevator, especially on the train, and we do not pay attention to the fact that this is difficult and very harmful
We do not even know that the antenna of a cellular phone in such conditions produces a large amount of radiation at a high level
This has a negative impact on human health by heating parts of the body
Young people will use the "mobile phone" day and night without a break
Even at night he listens to music.
And half a meter from the charging plant, we do not know that the high voltage electric current coincides with the high voltage dormant under the wire
This even leads to brain tumors
Scientists also found that if you talk for a long time on a mobile phone, this person heats the brain to a degree [20]
This year, the World Health Organization said mobile phones are harmful to adolescent health
Scientists believe that within 10 years, half an hour a day, communicating with mobile phones, the risk of glioma will increase to 40%
It is clear that mobile phones are the main mechanism of electromagnetic radiation
Rays affecting exacerbation of these neural endocrine and sexual diseases
Swedish scientists reported that from 10-11 years old, people with a mobile phone may have problems with brain tumors
Because electromagnetic radiation penetrates the nerve center of the brain, regulating the mental capacity
According to experts, the current epilepsy can become a wireless phone, as well as the main cause of complications and mental illness
Countries of the world are comprehensively studying the danger of a mobile phone to human life
Even in some States, children of school age are prohibited from having a mobile phone
Spanish scientists have proved that the bioelectric activity of the brain is restored within 11-13 hours after two minutes of communication on the phone 2 a young child
The same opinion was expressed by scientists who conducted research in a number of cities in the UK
A study by the Institute of Hygiene of Russia showed that within 5-10 years, 20-29-year-old citizens who used wireless phones have an increased risk of a brain tumor
This means that the earlier teenagers use mobile phones, the higher the risk of illness.
But there are those who do not agree with such an opinion of scientists
It has not yet been fully proved that a mobile phone has such an effect on the human body
Although there are numerous studies in the world, this is only an indirect opinion
According to Professor Asker Esenkulov, such studies have not yet been proved
"Therefore, do not signal the danger of a wireless phone
These are only small studies, "says Asker Esenkulov [21]
In general, the interest in mobile phone is children and youth
Mobile operators provide new services for children's entertainment
In 2001, the Office of Scientific Research of the European Parliament banned minor children from using mobile phones
Since then, European countries have categorically objected to the use of phones in schools
For example, in France, parents were required to monitor how long their children communicate by phone, when flyers should be presented in the UK to inform them of their dangers when selling a wireless phone
A group of scientists investigating the effects of radiation on the human body proposed introducing warning signs "Health Organization Warns" in mobile phone boxes
President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon in 2009 banned students in schools and universities from using mobile phones
However, children and young people remain the main consumer of the wireless phone.
In a statement, the Ankara Chamber of Physicians said: "Studies conducted in Europe have shown that people who used a mobile phone have increased the frequency of visits of some people with brain cancer for at least ten years."
The report says that mobile phones and their stations in the yards of schools should not be built in places of social life such as hospitals
The statement of the Ankara Chamber of Doctors drew attention to the fact that the impact of mobile phones and their stations on human health has become increasingly controversial since the creation of cable communication systems
translated
A statement saying that cell phones and stations communicate with each other by sending radio signals from the air said: "However, in order to distribute signals in airspace, it is necessary to create a low-level signal station in places with a large number of people, such as the city center
Communication spreads around and necessarily affects living organisms, "the report said.
A study conducted in 5 countries in Europe showed that people who used a mobile phone for at least 10 years increased the frequency of visits to some types of brain cancer
Along with this, changes in DNA occur with diseases such as changes in nerve cells, brain work and carotid changes.
Due to the threat to the health of cell phones, school yards should not be formed in places where there are children and sick elderly people, such as hospitals
English scientist G
Cooper noted that regular dispatch of envelopes and electronic vouchers through research has a negative impact on people's normal health

Summary
The article will address the issues of smoking among adolescents
Adolescence is very specific both physiologically and socially
Intensive growth and puberty are distinguished by psychophysiological manifestations, developing in that a certain psychological calm and sentiment in addition to their desire for adulthood manifest themselves as adults in front of their victims
Usually during this period, there is a desire for actions that involve young people in creating various risks or emergencies as a result of assessing their capabilities to experience.
Under the influence of certain social and individual changes, adolescents develop bad habits
Prevention of adolescent smoking should begin when these children do not have stereotypical patterns, attitudes and thinking
While dependence on the smell of tobacco and smoke has not yet developed, you need to start running
Prevention of smoking in adolescents is not only the fight against nicotine addiction, but also the preservation of the health of the entire population, and an increase in the life expectancy of the population
Parents with a high priority in tobacco prevention among children
But parents provide the necessary assistance in the prevention of smoking due to low qualifications or experience
cannot
The media (NSR) also have little consideration of youth programs with a certain reference cost, unfortunately
However, it should also be borne in mind that preventive work with adolescents about tobacco has a special place
The earlier in the article campaigning and studying tobacco smoking for all people, the more fruitful their prevention will be
Prevention of child and adolescent smoking with nicotine addiction

Formation of environmental education of the educational and methodological complex of the system of continuous environmental education Textbook of environmental education of the new generation
Efficient use of energy-saving water resources, energy-saving energy sources of green wind, natural energy resources of the future at EXPO-2017, green economy, environmental protection
Head of State in the strategy "Қazaқstan-2050": "We must create national competitive brands with a focus on environmental issues
As a result, I set the task of the agro-industrial complex - to become a global player in the field of cleaner production "
Special attention is paid to identifying environmentally friendly alternative sources that gradually destroy structures that are harmful to the environment
Described in detail in the recently approved Presidential Decree "On the Concept for the Transition of the Republic of Kazakhstan to a Green Economy"
For example, "Key priorities for the transition to a country's green economy": (1) improved use and management of resources (aquatic land biological and others); 2) construction of new ones with modernization of existing infrastructure; 3) improving the well-being of the population and the quality of the environment through a cost-effective way to mitigate pressure on the environment; 4) improving national security, including water "and" The concept of transition to a green economy "will be implemented in 3 stages [1]
Green economy is an economy aimed at preserving the well-being of society through the efficient use of natural resources, as well as ensuring the return of end-use products to the production cycle
The green economy is primarily currently prone to depletion (minerals)
- oil and gas) aimed at economical consumption of resources and efficient use of inexhaustible resources
Green economy is based on clean or green technologies
According to experts, the development of the green economy will avoid an environmental crisis in our country, which affected many post-industrial countries with its scale
Green economy projects are being implemented in the country to preserve the cleanliness of work
One of them is the generation of energy from the sun's rays, the second is the introduction of wind power in accordance with modern requirements, thereby maintaining the purity of nature [2]
The more the economy is ahead of modern migration, the more difficult it is to protect the environment
As you know, without the development of production, the economy will not advance
And stroller without killing or killing you along this path
The only way out is to develop a green economy.
In this regard, it seems to us that the international exhibition "EXPO-2017" in Astana will give a special impetus to the production of non-traditional energy sources
It is now undeniable that alternative energy sources are high-efficiency wind power for Kazakhstan
Windmills were first used in Persia in the 200s AD to grow grain
The mill, common in the Islamic world, was invented in Denmark in the 19th century by the first mill, which in the 13th century brought the crusaders to Europe and produced wind
In 1890, the first wind farm was launched and since then the United States has been building its plants with European countries, including China Japan Egypt India
Wind Power Leaders - Germany Spain USA Denmark Holland and India
Wind power is a significant part of the energy complex in more than 80 countries [4]
Wind energy reserves are one hundred times higher than the hydropower reserves of all rivers on the planet
According to scientists, the potential of wind energy on Earth reaches 1200 TW, but the use of this potential is not uniform everywhere
In order for the power of the wind passing through the vertical section to be sufficient to convert energy, at a height of 20-30 m, there must be more than the average annual wind speed
Wind power installed on the ground with an average annual specific wind power of 500 Vt/m2-қa (wind speed 7 m/s) converts only 500 Vt/m2-tyң 175 into electricity
The efficiency of wind energy (CCP) according to theoretical calculations is 593%
According to the publication, in practice, the largest wind power PKK on the wind unit will be close to 50%, but only at acceptable wind speeds provided by the project
But sometimes the wind speed goes beyond the calculated speeds
In one case, the wind speed will be too low, in this case the wind unit cannot work, in the second the wind speed will be too high, so the unit has to stop it so as not to fail [3]
For the first time in the history of Kazakhstan, the Atlas of the Winds of Kazakhstan was created
The results of the long-term joint work within the framework of this project of the UN Development Program "Kazakhstan - Prospects for the Development of Wind Energy" were announced at the Regional Conference on the Development of Renewable Energy Sources in the CIS and Central Asia in Astana, where the interactive map "Atlas of Winds of Kazakhstan" was presented
A country under the Kyoto Protocol has recently pledged to reduce to 15% the amount of greenhouse gases released into the air by 2020
The Renewable Energy Support Act was passed on 17 June 2009
Its goal was to create an enabling environment for the construction of renewable energy facilities
In accordance with this law, the Ministry of Industry monitors the "use of renewable energy"
More than 2 percent of Kazakhstan has wind power at an altitude of eighty meters at a speed of 7 meters per second
This is a huge indicator compared to the wind potential of other countries
Because in Europe, wind speed, albeit 4-5 meters per second, has established the use of wind capacities
The district of the Zhungar Gate in terms of the power of the line, which non-stop beats winter-summer in the Kazakh steppe, is in the front place
The average annual gust speed in it is 968 m/s
This will increase wind production to 5 thousand MW/s per year.
Wind speed from Silk corridor in Almaty region is 777 m/s
Also, the wind gust speed is 783 m/s in Aktau port in the area of ​ ​ the capital 68 m/s In Ereimentau 779 m/s in Karkaralinsk 626 m/s In Arkalyk 693 m/s in South Kazakhstan region will be 75 m/s in the village of Vinogradovo and the railway station Karabatan in Atyrau
The total capacity of the operated wind plants is 550 MHW, and the annual volume of electricity generation is 165 billion dollars.
kWh will be equal to
According to the Atlas in Kazakhstan, more than 50,000 km can produce 900,000 GGW - an hour of electricity per year, and these are the first steps towards a high goal
The fact that on December 5, 2011, the first 15 MW wind power plant in the Kordai district of Zhambyl region was commissioned by Izen-Su [2]
According to scientists, during energy work, 734 million harmful substances and 26 billion tons of hydrocarbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere annually
This pollution of nature can lead to a warming of our planet
You will not go far -
Glaciers of the White Ili Alatau over 50 years have dissolved by 45%
Some of its examples can be seen due to reduced vomiting
Today, when we take measures to preserve the environment of Almaty region with 22 mountain rivers in the world, such work will increase viability without compromising the health of future generations
Astana exhibition "EXPO-2017" causes public outcry, therefore a round table on this issue is organized at Abay Kazakh National Pedagogical University
Teachers of the Department of Ecology and Geography Education of Kazakhstan were students of 1-3 courses 5V060800-ecology of specialties and the Department of Youth Policy and State Language Development of Workers University "Zhasyl el" in Almaty
During the round table "External image of Kazakhstan in the international arena," reports were compiled on the topic "Pace of solving EXPO-2017 and environmental problems" "Energy of the future," as well as a discussion among students
Those present shared their views
As a result, EXPO-2017 is the only way to improve the ecological state of the country for the future of our country and contributes to its holding
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - Head of State N
Nazarbayev's message to the people of Kazakhstan
- Astana 2013
Program on development of electric power industry of Kazakhstan for 2010-2014
- Astana 2010
Main provisions: human ecology demographic situation, steady population growth, environmental pollution, environmental diseases, ecology of the city population, ecology of the population, ecology of carcinogenic substances correct nutrition
To date, human ecology is a rural village, coordination of quantitative and international relations between the inhabitants of the city and the peoples of the world, continuous environmental education and education, spiritual enthusiasm for the ethics of environmental culture is the protection of environmental rights of people and a comprehensive study of ethno-ecological problems
Currently, it is an integrated science to find ways to ensure the environmental safety of the inhabitants of the globe (B)
"Human ecology" according to the classification of the structure of ecology compiled by Reimers later (1994) means a new direction of ecology, which includes individual scientific areas, such as the ecology of local residents and archeology
The ecology of the city is a scientific discipline that studies the laws of human relations with the urban environment
Urbanization is currently under way throughout the world, which leads to an aggravation of environmental issues
The environmental situation in large cities and production centers of our country is becoming more difficult every day
This issue is particularly dynamic in terms of the degree of air pollution by water
Ecology of the population - a scientific discipline that studies the processes of reproduction and development of the peoples of the Earth
The results of such a study will make it possible to implement measures to maintain demographic balance
At the present stage of world demographic development, the trend of "demographic growth" prevails
Archeology (architectural ecology) is a new direction in architecture, providing for a more detailed consideration of the social and socio-economic needs of citizens in designing the construction of the city
It is said above that in cities the most environmentally unfavorable conditions are formed (environmental pollution by toxicants is photochemical smog t
) dramatically increases examples of morbidity of citizens
Therefore, recreation parks (parks), divided into green stripes near residential areas, fountains (fountains), strive to bring people closer to nature
installation will make it possible to use high-quality building materials in the construction of buildings and ensure their harmlessness for people
According to Novozhenova, man with the help of culture tends to exist and the ability to exist on Earth
It is this culture that gives humanity the opportunity to develop new ecological centers (niche) for living in the culture environment, creating favorable conditions for itself with the shell of the Earth in its zones [1]
The aforementioned philosopher I.
"Man" (1985)
- subject of socio-historical process
Bio- social being, genetically connected with other forms of life, developing material and spiritual culture on Earth, but differing from them in its creative activity and artificial self-consciousness, producing and expressed speech property of its means of work "
English scientists R
Park and E
Buergess introduced the term "human ecology" into science
One of the areas of research of the human ecology department is human health
Human health - its objective state, determined by a subjective feeling of physical mental and social comfort
High-grade mental activity does not provide self-regulation of the human body
Needs play the role of an internal regulator of human actions, provoke concrete actions, strive to set themselves a specific goal and achieve this goal
People are constantly organizing activities to combat environmental diseases
Environmental changes in nature negatively affect their vital activities
The 21st century is expected to be the century of allergic diseases
Cause of allergic diseases (allergy to bronchial drugs rheumatism red jaw t
b) disturbance of the immune system from the vital activity of people in the environment with a violation of the stability of the natural environment
A dangerous environment in which other new pollutants can form, dramatically changing by the dominant factors of the urban environment
Therefore, it is obvious that allergies are types of diseases caused by body resistance
Malignancies and mortality
Cancer (gr.
"oncos" - tumor) - a neoplasm exceeding the pathological growth of the uterus
The development of cancer, that is, cancer can arise as a result of the long-term use of certain products: lung cancer - skin cancer in uranium ore miners - is identified in pipe cleaners
These diseases are caused by exposure to so-called carcinogens
Carcinogenic substances (gr.
"crustacean") or simply a chemical compound, which, when exposed to a carcinogenic organism, creates a new model that is not malignant
Depending on their actions, they are divided into 3 groups:
local action; 2) organotropic, that is, modifying known organs; 3) pathogens of tumors in various organs of great effect
Alkaloid nitrogen-red compounds to carcinogens
They are in a carbonaceous layer and resin in contaminated air smoke, and many of them have a mutagenic effect on the body
Suret-4
The structure of the incidence of the population in the republic for 2013 (in units)
Now the specifics will stop	in the republic for 2013	population	the pattern of incidence is as follows:
Respiratory disease - 40%;
Skin and skin cell diseases - 8%;
Urinary diseases - 7%;
Diseases of the digestive system - 6%;
Diseases of the eye and his pupil - 5%;
Infectious and parasitic diseases - 5%;
Fainting and poisoning - 7%;
Other diseases - 22% [23]
As we see in this structure, 40% of the population suffer from respiratory diseases
Specific outbreaks of these diseases are affected by influenza and increased infection and angina
In second place are diseases of skin and subcutaneous manufacturers (8)
In third place are urinary diseases, fainting and poisoning
Increased overweight of people - a phenomenon characteristic of the habitat of the city with nutrition and low physical activity
Although excess nutrition is necessary to store energy on the body, it is necessary that energy and physical activity maintain equilibrium
However, there is an increase in the population of asthenic (dementia) people: tendency to lose weight
Both species eventually receive pathological consequences
The increase in the birth rate of infants who have not reached physical maturity is an indicator of the unfavorable state of people's habitat
Depending on the growth threshold of adaptation of the breakage apparatus to disturbances and changes in the habitat
The result of a mismatched balance of the environment causing the effects of acceleration and other changes on the growth threshold of a person who has not reached physiological maturity
The state of modern people as a biological species can also be reflected by numerous medical and biological trends that arose in accordance with the change in the living environment of the city: myopia and tooth morbidity of school-age children in accordance with an early unknown disease - production scientific and technological progress: radiation aviation automotive drugs and t.
bubbles are detected [4]
Thus, health protection or disease prevention is the result of the complex interaction of the internal biosystems of the body and the external environment
The recognition of such a complex attitude served as the basis for the emergence of preventive medicine and its scientific discipline - hygiene
Production - Urban Ecosystem
Urbanization - excessive population growth in the city, taking into account the increased population of the rural environment
Population growth and density is the main feature of the city
Julius Caesar (b
) the city of Rome during the
In 1980, the total area of ​ ​ the urbanized territory of the Earth amounted to 469 million km2, and in 2007 it amounted to only 128% of land by 19 million km2.
it is believed that the entire world population will live in urban-type villages (Reimers 1990)
Permanent population change - birth and birth of offspring, that is, natural conditions
The change in the size of population growth in a certain zone is also associated with the migration of people from other places (immigration) and their relocation to foreign regions (emigration), that is, with the resettlement and planting movement of the population
Also, the change in numbers depends on the transition of people from one group to another, depending on the marital status or social condition to the level of education.
A permanent change in population in a broad sense means a change in population size depending on natural conditions and the impact of migration
The creation of a family is of independent importance in the demographics of its development and decay
Changing the population and its parts in demography is considered not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively
For example, in addition to changing the number of people of a certain age, their changes in personal development health are also taken into account
In demography, various phenomena in relation to individuals are used to describe the state of both the entire population and certain groups of it as an independent form of research
Quantity and quality of population demographics with study of relationship of demographic processes with their dependence on socio-economic phenomena and socio-economic consequences of population development
legislation and legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan
The socio-economic conditions of society determine the changes of the population taking place in a specific social environment
The main thing for demography is the interaction of the population with the development of society [5]
Human daily life is closely linked to environmental conditions
Many properties inherent in living organisms are also characteristic of the human body
The development of human respiratory nutrition takes place in a natural environment
Therefore, a person is considered an integral part of life
At the same time, a person is a conscious person in the society in which he lives
Human growth is influenced by both social conditions and environmental factors for personal development and development

Global Warming - Green Direction of Infrastructure
If glaciers in Antarctica supply the husband in this form, then in 15-20 years ten states were under water.
Thus, due to the climate change of the planet, experts give mainly assumptions about the large release of greenhouse gases into the air and the spill of oil into the seas
The environmental challenges facing the human child have become increasingly complex from year to year, including, above all, the preservation of natural diversity and the elimination of desertification by the global challenge of climate change.
World drought hurts the lives of 2 billion people a year, and 150 million people around the world are forced to move
Global warming in Antarctica, that is, climate change, was forced to attract the attention of international organizations; at the UN meeting in Seoul in the spring of 2012, a special "Convention on Climate Change" was adopted
It was signed by 156 countries
In addition, the "Protocol on the Limitation of Emissions of Harmful Gases into the Atmosphere" was adopted
It provides for a reduction in emissions of harmful gases into the air from fuels and lubricants to 1990 levels and to 52% in 2008-2012
For this, countries belonging to the European Union - 8% of the United States - 7% Japan Canada Poland Hungary - 6% of other countries agreed not to exceed the figure of a certain year
Recently speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York, Head of State N.
Nazarbayev noted that today the deepening of the global energy crisis and the growing risk of adverse climate changes on the planet are the most acute problems for the world community
Drought, which has reached record levels over the past 60 years, has led to famine in the Horn of Africa [1]
Mann noted that carbon dioxide released into the air in the future will have some impact on climate warming, and noted that recently a large amount of carbon dioxide has been spread over the decades, which can lead to global warming
Although today's experts recognize that the weather leading to natural disasters has changed, it cannot say anything about how to prevent danger
Nevertheless, they warn that humanity has only decades to take decisive steps to prevent catastrophic changes [2]
Although it is known that changes in air temperature in general will negatively affect the environment only on agriculture and public health
Therefore, this problem is also relevant for our country
remains in state
The climate problem further changes the air temperature in the country and leads to warming of natural zones to land degradation
Over the past 100 years, air warming on the planet has amounted to 07%, and in Kazakhstan there is an increase in the average air temperature to 13 degrees in the republic.
This is twice the world level
Each region will have its own weather
If its system is violated, the weather will undergo large changes
For example, recently in Europe we can talk about unprecedented weeks
In 2003, 70 thousand people died from heat in Europe
Then the temperature in France rose to 40 degrees
The same temperature was in Switzerland, which is considered a mountain zone
This temperature is never recorded in this country in the next 250 years
And in Hungary, drought lived the entire crop
Not only Europe was affected by mass warming, but India, where the air temperature reached 40-50 degrees, killed 1,400 people [3]
Scientists say such a list will continue if ice melt continues in this state
And in the 2040s, such accidents became stable when people felt like they were in a thread
"And before this disaster, people themselves will begin to destroy themselves," says Antonio Guterres, Commissioner of Migration at the UN
- For example, due to global warming, when the water on Earth rises by only one centimeter, about a million people will be forced to move from one place to another
And in this case, due to a quarrel with the ground, a civil massacre may begin "[4]
In agriculture, changes are noticeable that do not feel the inhabitants of the country
According to special specialists, today more than 60% of Kazakhstan's lands are subject to drought
With a decrease in green spaces and forest-steppes, livestock pasture narrows
Most of the agricultural land has become desert
Declining green spaces in a poor forest country further accelerates drought
In the country, the saxaul and bush region is 42%, and the forest area in the whole country is only 12%
That is, this nature of climate change has a negative effect, which can lead to negative consequences.
In general, issues raised by the Head of State, especially environmental ones
That is, no one should object to modern clean production and high technology
Kazakhstan has been working for several years to attract international investments included in the Kiota Protocol
Thus, Kazakhstan attracts large investments in re-equipment of energy sector
Because most of our production equipment is outdated from the Soviet Union
Also along this path, it is possible to update equipment based on advanced technologies and increase the competitiveness of domestic industry in the world market
This will not only save energy, but also clear the air from reducing carbon dioxide emissions
This, in turn, will increase our credibility with the international community and increase the chances of becoming a competitive country [5]
According to research by scientists, the climate of Scotland, when global warming deprived today's France of priority in the production of wine in the world and, conversely, gave whiskey for centuries, can be very favorable for grapes
In particular, the hot summer of 2012 covered the south of Europe Italy Spain reduced grape harvesting in France by 12%
Scientists say that an increase in temperature above 35 degrees negatively affects the vineyard, later winemakers often suffer from such barriers
Damage to agriculture will not only affect drought and flooding, but will also lead to the spread of tropical pests to wider zones.
Scientists note that already with a warming climate, the spread of tropical pests is moving north at a speed of 3 km/year
Researchers note that some mushrooms move 6-7 kilometers
Scientists' anxiety grows due to the emergence of new strains of infectious diseases under the influence of various global warming
And their ability to withstand treatment year after year speaks of the dangers of adapting to the environment
The famous English economist Lord Nicholas Stern said that in 2050 millions of people escaped hunger due to prolonged drought and other climatic fluctuations: floods and hurricanes
fears it could be a "climate refugee"
Ultimately anthropogenic climate
The consequences of the change will also cause huge damage to transport and other infrastructure
All this should understand how difficult the economic and socio-political problems will be, which will go forward globally as a whole
Therefore, it is important that each country be as prepared as possible for climate change, trying to diversify its economy
At the same time, the importance of which state keeps the economy in the green direction will increase every day [6]
Therefore, if it is not too late to avoid climate change, including global warming, it will cause great harm to all humanity
Of course, to do this, it is first necessary to prevent anthropogenic factors
Summing up, I want to say that only people who can solve them themselves are to blame for the beginning of these problems.
Therefore, all together must take care of the environment

Summary
The traditions of verification of results are diverse
Recently, much attention has been paid to improving the testing of students' knowledge
In addition to traditional forms of quality testing of this regulation, the pedagogical test is widespread
There are four main types of test:
Tasks 2
Tasks for Identification 3
Open jobs for proper job placement
In closed tasks, the student selects one or more correct answers from the presented options
When preparing them, 4-5 options for answering tasks are drawn up in such a way that one of them is correct
Odds of random responses with few answer options are significantly higher
Each alternative answer should take into account proximity to reality, so to speak, the basic errors of the student
For identification tasks, you must assign multiple items to identify a single item
To do this, the definition of formula 2-3 is recorded on the left side of the chain, numbered with numbers, and the answers indicated by letters are indicated on the right
Each concept on the left must correspond to a formula or the definition of one correct answer on the right
In this case, the correct answer consists of two paragraphs
In tasks to build tasks in the correct sequence, you need to test students' knowledge of the sequence of actions
Special instructions should be given before such tasks: find the correct sequence
Task name and its main elements are transmitted in random sequence
A rectangle is placed in front of each element, in which each student sets a number indicating the order of the answer
In case of one error, the answer is considered incorrect
Open Jobs
Answers in this type of tasks are not issued by trainees, supplemented (compiled)
When compiling tasks, formula 1-2 is composed in such a way that there are numbers or words
To do this, leave room to complete the answer
One way to improve test tasks is to increase the number of correct answers
The correct answers in such tasks can be found in knowledge of the chemical properties of substances of certain types of laws
Oxides, one of the main representatives of inorganic compounds
Test tasks related to this topic have been created
Three of the 6 assigned tasks are correct

One of the main tasks of the education system - the introduction of new educational technologies - access to international global communication networks for the informatization of education
Informing the educational process - development training using new innovative technologies provides for increasing the efficiency and quality of all levels of the educational process with the implementation of the goals of targeted individual training
The United Nations solution is called "The 21st Century - The Information Age"
The Republic of Kazakhstan has also entered a new stage, when the main sign of scientific and technological progress will be the informatization of society
In recent years, important measures have been taken to fundamentally modernize education
One of them is the e-learning system introduced in accordance with the state program for the development of education for 2011-2020
Ensures the continuity of e-learning in the global information space and increases its competitiveness
E-Learning - Educational
a specific type of training, implemented on the basis of pedagogical and information and communication technologies of interactive distance in the information educational environment based on interactive methods of activity and taking into account the results of student education
This type of training is carried out as a variety of the type of educational and cognitive actions of students and interactive interaction with the educational information environment [1]
Complex of electronic resources - electronic textbooks
Existing electronic textbooks can be conditionally classified as electronic copies of textbooks and multimedia electronic textbooks
Unlike the first last - it contains various videos, animations, interactive tasks and drawings 3D-үlgіlerі virtual labs and tests
Interactive tasks are very effective for formative assessment of students
In world practice, e-learning is an integral part of modern education
In terms of e-learning distribution Kazakhstan lags behind US Finland Singapore South Korea Canada Australia New Zealand
Education models created in these countries work to accelerate the development of the economy and successfully achieve strategic goals that increase the country's competitiveness [2]
One of the main conditions of the e-learning system is ensuring the transparency of the educational process in accordance with the requirements of the best international practices
International rankings of the International Institute for Assessment of Training Results, such as TIMSS PISA, should be carried out in order to determine the positions of Kazakhstan's education
To this end, a review of modern foreign training programs for general education schools in geography will be carried out.
One of the main examples of innovative educational programs in geography for schoolchildren:
French company Anuman Interactive first created Earth Atlas in an interactive 3D image
Convenient systematization of demographics with large volume processing of topographic meteorological geographical hydrographic data
A new multimedia tool for secondary schools in grades 6-7 of the Cyril and Methodius Virtual School series, based on the content of interactive exercises from video fragments from three-dimensional models [3]
Interactive maps
Integrated in control tasks and training tasks in the departments of physical geography and economic geography
Here, the answer is automatically checked, the instruction to bring to exact state to complete tasks is fully registered on the Internet in the format of "digital training resources"
Google will allow you to see the depths of the oceans based on a new 3D map model of the Earth
The countries of the world compiled by Jewel have created interesting information about the history of the economy and the climate of the state structure of cognitive geographical data in the form of online lessons [4]
Widely known products of major international content companies such as TWIG (UK) SANOMA (Finland) PHET TED (USA) IDP (Poland)
Based on such experience, the domestic manufacturer can call "BMG"
Front-line company on translation of e-learning content in another language taking into account state educational standards and linguistic and cultural characteristics of the Kazakh education system
It is based on the platform of multilingual education (Kazakh Russian language - truth), created on the basis of the achievements of the modern field of digital educational resources for general education schools in the geographical subject in the future [5]
This will be the largest collection of educational content that meets modern requirements
Developed in accordance with the curricula as an educational tool for general education schools
Here are test exercises of theoretical and practical types of lessons and graphics diagrams of figures of geographical maps
used in "digital learning resources" format
Figure 1
Structural content of the lesson
Here, in a geography lesson, you can see the informative features of information on the topic "Shape of the Earth"
According to the theme "Earth as Geoid" "Understanding the Ancient Indians" "The Concept of Plato" "Aristotle's argument" Calculating Earth Circles "" Changing the Idea of ​ ​ the Earth Form "" Earth and Globe "" Test Tasks "are created from the" Final Results "
Figure 2
Short course of classes
Students will be presented with a short mini-thesis on "Earth as Geoid" with an introduction to Earth data
That is, here the concept of "geoid" can be read recently along with a photograph of students about the nature of the geoid discoverer of this term
Figure 3
Aristotle's argument mini-thesis
Regarding the topic "Understanding the Ancient Indians," one can explain the brief content, which depicts such information as "Explanation of Plato," "Proof of Aristotle"
Figure 4
Films connect the knowledge of students of interest with real life, thereby ensuring the preservation of memory
For the use of educational organizations in the educational process and self-students, it is enough to create a fund of video recordings of cycles of thematic classes and lectures of foremen
Video recordings of lessons can be seen on the local Internet in off-line mode and on simple computers
Such educational video materials in small educational organizations will be in demand in educational organizations with a low supply of educational materials and technological infrastructure
Figure 5
Structure of practical sessions
To perform practical exercises, it is necessary to determine the main elements of shers based on the data passed in the theoretical part with photographing of the figure
Focus on research modules based on scientific results
In turn, the identification of intellectual opportunities to clarify and remember the student's knowledge on the new past topic provides an opportunity to monitor the level of preparation for classes
Figure 6
Test Job Results
Test tasks and their results can be seen in order to summarize knowledge of new classes
In the e-learning system, teachers can create their own tutorials and tests
Their work will be standardized by a single Microsoft Word Microsoft training content creation system PowerPoint Adobe Flash Adobe Photoshop in text and graphics editors and environments
In addition, based on scientific results, they are focused on educational modules of a research nature:
special thematic maps and graphs;
geographic maps and an educational environment with a set of patterns obtained from an artificial earth satellite;
a set of materials designed according to chronological rules;
virtual laboratories or models based on the study of its phenomena;
collections of information sources;
complex interactive learning materials
Also, one of the personal tasks of this training is the creation of digital educational resources and the delivery of content providers for the education of children with disabilities [5]
The use of digital educational resources in classes is carried out by students:
Resemble materials that are missed and forgotten to save time
Find additional materials not found in the textbook as soon as possible;
Endlessly repeat misunderstandings;
Carry out their own training activities and verify themselves at all stages of work;
Take advantage of modern information technologies in organizing training activities;
Use multimedia technologies of hypermatinic and hypermedial systems in the training process;
Monitor the intellectual capabilities of students at the knowledge level of the business level in preparation for classes;
also allows you to use personal computers and mobile devices
New textbooks, rich in multi-media, are produced using technologies for creating and distributing e-books and textbooks, which allow you to listen to them for reading by all types of electronic devices
Its features:
Development of high-quality e-books with textbook processing in pdf files;
Creating the ability to easily complement the text of a multimedia book;
Reading electronic textbooks through all devices (including mobile);
Textbooks are freely used in schools and other educational institutions;
Books are available to individual readers in modern ways;
Can use interactive books using a personal computer and mobile devices;
Can create its own electronic library;
Based on storing copies of books on all devices
Thus, digital educational resources are of interest not only to students, but also to teachers, and their use will certainly not lead to a result that is not based on planned principles and didactic goals.
Therefore, the use of new information technologies will certainly have a positive effect
Act No. 319 of 27 July 2007 on education
State programme for the development of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020
The theoretical method of the communication method of the dialog method of the simulation method of educational and cognitive action - a traditional lesson in illustrated training
The goal of education and upbringing in modern society is the comprehensive development of the individual
In the current conditions of constant and rapid change, the creative actions of the teacher and student are relevant, requiring a person's ability and effort to realize himself
At the same time, the main part of the social questions asked by parents is the question of ensuring the development of children as individuals, and not just education.
In this regard, pedagogical science is faced with the task of forming a person who knows how to set a report with a developed intellectual thinking ability and find rational methods and means of solving it independently
In the classroom, effectively apply learning technologies by developing the ability of students to acquire new knowledge, as well as shaping new ways of their actions with the help of learned knowledge and skills
Learning technology, focused on the patterns of personal development, creates the most favorable conditions for its development, considering the student as a person
General philosophical development began to be understood as a national principle of knowledge and interpretation of the history of society and nature with irreversibly directed changes in the rule of law and universal properties of matter and consciousness
Organization of developmental training will allow the student to learn mental actions
A feature of the methodology of developmental education is that it is formed on the basis of joint actions of students and teachers
Motivation of collective affairs in which the teacher organizes cognitive activities, and not an evaluator explaining the ready knowledge in this case
Only such training opens your eyes to the mind and develops the creativity of the child
Methods and techniques of work can be invented in the lesson and be able to choose certain forms of interaction between students
In subsequent years, the development of education became a question of psychology and pedagogical sciences
Damata
The purpose of the training is training, the tasks and approaches of which are brought into line with the legislation of the child's development [1]
In modern education, four conceptual versions of the theory of developmental learning are widely used:
Zankov's concept (didactic system of primary school);
for different types of education system
Davydov's concept of developmental training;
Biblera concept (development system "School of cultural dialogue");
The Amonashvili concept (primary education system based on the principle of cooperation) [2]
The general significance for all these types of training is that it is aimed at the ability of the student to have personal qualities
The core of these theories is that personal development is carried out in the process of learning and upbringing, as well as that the development of the student's mental ability is advanced.
In solving the problems of comprehensive learning and personal development of a student within the framework of the theory of developmental learning, it is important to solve the organizational actions of students, such as differentiation and privatization of education.
Training taking into account the peculiarities of educational activity organization
Education Belikov
"A whole range of activities of the student and teacher-educator ensures its development and formation on all sides of execution" [3]
By a new active-effective type of training can be understood the place of developmental training-illustrative training
An important and common condition for achieving developmental training is the preservation of the research and research nature of the educational activities of students in the case of providing a system of theoretical concepts as the quality of the subject of learning
In the context of developmental training aimed at assimilating the concepts, "I know, but I can't yet" is translated into the formula "I can't," that is, I don't know "
A number of scientists (L
Halperin et al.
) created the following important principles of developmental learning:
The learning process should arouse the student's interest in learning;
When compiling the content of the lesson, the educational process should be designed so that the student, based on his current development territory, can solve the calculation or problem;
for the effective development of the student, it is important to take into account the "conditions of profitability" of each of them, that is, to give tasks that the student can perform on his own in order to obtain a result;
assessment should be made in the process of achieving the final result, that is, the student should compare himself with other students with his previous actions
There are a number of methods for organizing the development learning process:
Research method
It will be aimed at implementing the idea of ​ ​ "news discovery training"
In the framework of this method, the student must independently identify the patterns of phenomena that can solve calculations previously unfamiliar to him
He relied on his knowledge and knowledge
Communicative or Dialog Method
Students are authors who can express their views on a certain scientific problem
When implementing this method, students form the ability to express their thoughts, and the understanding of someone else, the ability to be critical of him develops, expressing his attitude to the "truth"
Simulation method
Each of them independently works with a common task, imitating a company or institution divided into class groups
Results of actions are evaluated and the best and most interesting of them are determined
As such, you can get project protection in the lessons
Let's try a comparative analysis of traditional training and developmental training
Thus, when applying the technology of developmental learning at school, the teacher needs to approach any opinion of the student on the content of the topic in which his professional position is discussed
What attention should he pay to the content of the student, without thinking about what material he reported in the lesson, and conduct an even interview in the analysis of their opinions
Each reader should be able to express his opinion on the issue under discussion
The teacher's task is to provide them with support by summarizing the "options" voiced by students, emphasizing that their more scientific content coincides on the subject of classes
The most important feature of developmental learning is the provision of the opportunity to successfully master the material of the program with the support of students participating in psychophysical relations
If the teacher pays great attention to informing the material (lecture - practical lesson) in a traditional lesson, then the teacher in the training should be in the assistant organizer of a corrective interview with the separation of students into groups depending on personal characteristics, in order to create all favorable conditions for the individual development of each student
At the same time, the deliberate application of developmental learning technology helps students, by increasing their interest in the subject, become actively independent citizens who are able to strongly express their thoughts on education.

"The new position of problem learning is that at this stage it is necessary to put it into practice, and not in the type of methodological system of teaching didactics or in the form of training," says E.
Problem Training - New Type of Training
It can become the basis for learning students on the basis of creative search with the replacement of the interpretive and illustrative method
The main difference between traditional learning and problematic (problematic) learning is expressed in two aspects:
in order to organize the pedagogical process;
rules;
The goal of traditional learning is to equip students with knowledge of the basics of knowledge, and the goal of problematic learning is not only to form the level of knowledge and skills of the results of scientific knowledge, but also to achieve these results, to form the cognitive independence of the student and increase his ability to find skills
Problem learning refers to active education technology, such as a programmed learning system
On its basis, any task refers to a solution to a problem
Greek problem
"problem" - from the word of the task
In a broad sense, a problem means a question that requires a theoretical and educational unresolved solution and research
The psychological dictionary gives the following definition: "the problem is in the subject's understanding of the impossibility of solving difficulties and contradictions in the current situation thanks to knowledge and experience"
Problem learning - creating problematic issues and teacher leadership and actively solving problems and student pages
As a result, their thinking abilities develop - create conditions for the formation of skills and skills
Turning to the history of the formation of problem learning, socrates directs his students into logical thinking to find the results of research
Russo drew attention to the situation in the development of knowledge
Among the scientists who used it on their own experience are the works of Pestalozzi and Disterverga
Based on this training method, D systematically implemented it
Deune died
Depending on the type of follow-up training
Makhmutov made a great contribution
The goal of problem learning is not only the mastery of the knowledge system of the results of scientific knowledge, but also the mastery of the process of achieving these results, the formation of cognitive independence of the student, the development of his creative abilities
A new system of rules for the use of long-known languages ​ ​ of instruction and instruction, developed taking into account problematic educational - thought operations and laws of search activity of students
Therefore, in many ways it develops the mental abilities of schoolchildren and ensures the formation of trust
Unlike other methods of problem learning - education does not seem ready for students, on the contrary, they are tasked with solving a certain problem themselves
Thus, the solution in the search process allows the students themselves to master the knowledge
Problem training "problem" "problem issue" "problem task" includes the concepts of "problem situation"
The problem is that the subject has available search tools (literacy search experience, etc.
) can be solved
Any question is not a problem task
The main condition of their problem is that when finding an answer, the student will not have a ready answer or an example, and he is aware of the contradiction between his knowledge and ignorance, in other words, there is not enough knowledge or a way to solve a given problem.
Problematic situations suggest that the phenomena that have arisen can lead to conflict without explaining the facts by a person
The problem task includes part of the action, for which students have to do several studies on their own
For example, perform Experimental work
Pour 1 g of copper and 2-3 ml of 01M iron (III) chloride solution
What is noticed? Record your changes in the notebook
Is that what interested you? Compose the reaction equation
What are the Fe + 3io properties? This is the largest educational task
Solving this problem requires the absence of special search data
Therefore, we are considering ways out of these difficulties and moving on to their action
The actions of the student during the period of problematic response are characterized by an independent search for thinking
Problem training requires not only the creation of problem situations, but also the development of approaches to their correct solution
To do this, the teacher must teach the methodology of studying self-exclusion to assimilate the ways and methods of solving it, creating conditions for the student to correctly understand the contradictions of thoughts on the topic
The main way is to learn how to think properly
The effectiveness of various types of exercises in the examination of many teachers and psychologists lies in their variable characteristics
Problem problems prove what and how the conclusions appeared in the interpretation of the lesson, and direct logical thinking on the path of scientific search
Problem tasks have a greater impact on feelings and develop the student's passion for knowledge.
Oppression of humor leads the student to an independent search
Without a search, there is no creative thinking
The result of the problem task can be called the perfect maximum stage of the student's ability and ability to work independently
The goals of problem training are:
training in logical scientific creative thinking;
education based on the formation of a scientific dialectical and materialistic worldview, proving and convincing the creation of educational material among students exclusively without the formation of knowledge;
contribute to building the strength of knowledge, since the information found by students on their own is well preserved in memory;
forming beliefs such as influencing the emotional field of the student, satisfying them with the complexity of mental actions on the reliability of their forces;
Development of simple search and research skills;
developing student activity through the stress of his passion for science, attaching importance to his desire for knowledge
Problem Learning Tasks M
Under general and special tasks, Mahmutov divided:
Common Problem Learning Tasks:
students mastering educational systems and mental and practical techniques of activity;
development of cognitive independence and creative abilities of students;
formation of dialectical and materialistic thinking of schoolchildren
Special tasks of problem training are:
creative learning skills;
developing skills in creative application of knowledge (application of learned knowledge to a new situation) and ability to solve problems of learning;
formation and synthesis of experience of creative activity;
increasing the scientific degree of training;
improving the effectiveness of the formation of a scientific worldview
Currently, problematic learning technologies have shown the following achievements:
creates the conditions for the formation of a real scientific worldview of students
Ensures that students have their own views
Forms the learner's cognitive interest
Develops the disciple's thinking
Creative search of students involves the discovery of cognitive phenomena
But this technology also has the following drawbacks:
The formation of practical power and skills cannot be constantly effective
Compared to other learning technologies, it takes a long time to learn the same amount of knowledge
Finally, opportunities for problematic learning technologies:
A new concept of a student is directed to independent creative activity
Students learn new knowledge with the help of a teacher in order to consistently and purposefully pose a cognitive problem to them
Provides a special kind of thinking so that students can use knowledge, as well as in creative experience with knowledge
In this regard, the interaction of teacher and student in problem learning will be as follows:
Ways to Create and Solve Learning Problems
There are several ways to create problematic conditions in chemistry training
Message or visual display of unknown and data to be explained to students
The emergence of a contradiction between education and the facts of the student under consideration
Explanation of facts based on a well-known theory;
Validation of prognosis based on known theory in practice (through chemical experiment);
Find the initial conditions and effective solution path when giving the result;
To independently find a solution to the issued contracts;
Application of the historical principle;
Report or show visual (demonstration) data, unknown and requiring clarification to students
Consider Class 9 Carbon
1 stage
Preparation for the adoption of the problem
The teacher asks students the question: "Have you met a simple thing in life - carbon?"
Schoolchildren resemble coal and charcoal
Stage 2
Create problem situations:
The teacher clearly shows diamond coal and says that when these substances burn in the air, carbon dioxide is formed
The opposite is the emergence of contradictions: the formation of different substances by oxygen of one product
Stage 3
Wording of the problem:
The teacher comes up with what questions to ask the student to create problems
What is the composition of diamond graphite?
What are the physical properties of these objects?
Why do these substances have the same chemical properties and physical properties are different?
What do you even call these things? Stage 4
Solving the problem
All questions asked are explained by the presence of allotropic changes in carbon
All these questions are aimed at solving the situation, so they can be periodically raised
We solve a big problem by creating several thumbnails
Answers:
Diamond graphite coal - simple substances
They are formed from carbon
Combustion products consist of CO2 oxygen and carbon;
Diamond graphite characterizes the physical properties of coal: diamond hard graphite is soft and t
Students compare the physical and chemical properties of carbon diamond graphite; shows differences in physical properties and similarities in chemical properties
As a result, it is concluded that the difference between these substances lies in their internal structure.
Stage 5
Prove the correctness of the decision
The teacher clearly shows the crystal lattices of diamond and graphite, explains the amorphous structure of coal and hay
Students resemble the phenomenon inherent in the properties of oxygen and sulfur, which they have previously considered, that is, what they say about allotropic changes in the composition of the same but different properties.
Is it possible to create a problem situation on this topic differently? For example:
The teacher clearly demonstrates allotropic changes and explains why this phenomenon is possible
The contradiction between the student's education and the facts under consideration
to use
Next Topic
Consider the topic "Hydrolysis of Salts"
1 stage
Preparation for the adoption of the problem
Training acids visually determine reaction medium of distilled water from bases and salt solutions using indicator
Students carefully monitor the specified experience, fill out the schedule (Table 1)
Indicator color and reaction medium
period
Creating a Problem Situation
Previously, schoolchildren learned that acid solution is the reaction medium - acidity, and alkalinity -
During the experiment, a new fact, that is, the presence of acidity or alkalinity of the middle of the salt solution, requires clarification based on additional knowledge
period
Formulate a problem
Explanation of the acidity or validity of the aqueous salt solution to the indicators
Stage 4
Solving the problem
The teacher divides the students into groups and offers tasks:
Presenting various ideas to explain the properties of salts in aqueous solution;
Analysis and evaluation of different ideas come to a common conclusion;
Listen to each group's responses
Stage 5
Check and evaluate the solution
Teacher summarizes
Introduces the concept of "hydrolysis of salts" and together with students issues a certificate for this concept
Then he considers other salts with schoolchildren to pre-suggest the reaction medium in their aqueous solution and test it as an experiment
The use of problematic learning technologies in the educational paradigm - develops the logical thinking of students, increases interest in educational work, accustoms them to self-education, gives a high result to creative education and durable education

Summary
This article describes the test tasks for determining the correct order on the topic "Survival of unicellular animals"
Assign test jobs to determine the correct order of action
Check formation generation in the chain
It is necessary to give instructions on such tasks: to determine the correct order
Tasks name and their main elements are given in arbitrary sequence
A quadrangle is placed next to each element, in which the student writes a digit, which is a sequence of numerical actions
With one error, the answer is considered incorrect
Testing and evaluation of learners' knowledge is the most important part of the educational process, the purpose of which is to determine the volume of students' knowledge on the strength and degree of knowledge of practical skills of remembering, self-awareness and application of knowledge obtained in practice
Extensive pedagogical testing with different forms of knowledge testing and evaluation to test and evaluate students' knowledge
In pedagogical practice, when applying tasks in a test form, the teacher established that the psychological burden on the student is minimal, since the student's knowledge is objectively assessed independently of the teacher, the education of all students in the class includes a one-time examination, and the time for its conduct is slightly reduced
Of several test job forms, 4 types are most compatible
Closed Jobs 2
Compliance Tasks 3
Right Order 4 Tasks
Open Jobs
Most tests are closed jobs that give jobs and one correct answer from multiple answers
Test tasks for determining the correct order are often not compiled
This article provides examples of test tasks for determining the correct order on the topic "The existence of unicellular animals"
Tasks with closed forms of test tasks for knowledge testing and pedagogical testing, Tasks for determining the correct tasks
Selection of educational technologies for the organization of the educational process for the training of environmental education specialists, sustainable development and evaluation of the result
This model will combine all the possibilities of logistical support of environmental knowledge and education carried out by enterprises and organizers - customers and educational institutions, and take into account their joint use in the form of a national training research and production ground, intended for use by all founding organizers.
The assembly of one-meter models has to carry out the scientific systematization of the available materials, and both tags - in fact with a new improvement
Other measures that ensure the further development of the practical structure and ideas of environmental education and education as a system that can meet rapidly changing needs in the process of environmental education and education in order to ensure the environmental safety of the Republic of Kazakhstan
replaces modules [1]
The role of the media in environmental education and education
Media work is carried out on the basis of the information and environmental system
It will be traditional media
Radio TV periodicals
At the same time, multimedia technology is a computer system
The enormous role of the computer system in environmental education and education
Provides multiple information messages from a computer system
In all environmental scientific data of interest to members of society involved in the re-introduction of some of the faults of stopping components of the biosphere;
Only areas of specialized educational disciplines and restrictions are generally oriented towards a certain orientation
Environmental and biological scientific materials;
Reflects the possibilities of access to many banks without data from case studies and other sources of environmental knowledge for the formation of an assessment of environmental truth in various ecological zones of the Republic of Kazakhstan [2]
Traditional media:
Prepare a communication for training on environmental protection and the rational use of natural bioresources surrounding the appeal of the child of mankind;
Ecology For the holding of a monthly or annual contest of beautifully erased posters on the protection of components of the biosphere (terrestrial plant world) and the use of biological resources, the work of the media;
Allows you to form the theme of programs from televisions on the organization of environmental education and education [2]
Introduce distance (distance) education, taking into account the fact that compared to other tools, the one-time redundancy of instrumental assistance bpr
Sooner or later we will be remote in the 21st century
with the help of tools, we will certainly be guided by training
Often, in the reverse process, environmental materials are involuntarily remembered, and information is presented in logical and figurative form
Allows you to maintain the strength of the game when viewing information
Thus, environmental thinking is formed
Measurement of vision becomes sure of the possibility of re-upgrading the screen phenomenon or process at any speed
The collective work of the creators of the means for training (screenwriter-producer, methodologist-teacher of the artist) should be aimed at all available opportunities for constantly reproducing the truth to the film photographer
In the XXI century, the main goal - in schools of the Republic of Kazakhstan, including in schools of Almaty region, environmental education and education of young adolescents are identified by the world education system
To do this:
Studying international experience of ecological education and education and its detailed scientific analysis
Life itself shows that environmental education and education of young adolescents can be associated with their implementation, creating basic key and special scientific models for success
It became known that the education and education system of the twentieth century will become unsuitable for schoolchildren of the 21st century
In the 21st century, the growth of science and technology is so great that even humanity cannot predict
In this regard, we have the opportunity to present to students of the 21st century several "models of environmental education and education" [3];
Basic Model System - scientifically simulates content and structure of standards standards by course topics
It itself serves as the basis for the creation of a special scientific model of continuous environmental education and education;
Key models - ensure the fulfillment of the tasks of a special model of environmental education and education with various resources;
Each group of special models is created for certain social groups in the field of environmental education and education
The orientation of each model takes into account the possibilities of the structural topics of the training program with several thematic associations, as well as the methodology and characteristics of the group
Special models are created on the basis of basic and key models, taking into account the needs of a certain social group, in some cases they are combined
When transferring specialists of environmental professions of special models of continuous environmental education and education to train and sail specialists with excellent knowledge of the environment, statesmen should create a set of models for training workers of non-state organizations of print radio broadcasting in the field of power
Scientific models of continuous environmental education and education of urban and regional regions should also be created
They should take into account the national traditions of the Kazakh people established in connection with the protection of the natural environment surrounding the human child [4]
The complex of basic scientific models will cover all levels related to the new model of the national education system of the Kazakh country in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the school will have special secondary higher education and additional education for those who will remain here as the main specialty.
To supplement the content of special programs, it is necessary to have scientific models of environmental and educational work and propaganda work of the population in the field of ecology
These scientific models should help the public knowledge to take control of the adoption and implementation of environmental decisions to create an environment in the field of environmentally competent social sphere by identifying environmental specialists
It is necessary to develop a system of professional requirements for persons engaged in environmental activities in organizations, regardless of forms of ownership, by creating and implementing basic models of environmental standards [5]

About these historical monuments
Valuable feedback was expressed on the research of South Kazakhstan archaeological expeditions led by [1]
- When we saw the Syr region, you had dust on the land of Yaya Akmeshit, and at the bottom of each bush there was a piece.
Watch your shallow animal!
Ruzbakhani in his note "Hotel and Bukhara" says about the Cheese region: "The fields that should be irrigated from Syr Darya are abundantly processed with fruit and berry products, poured with green trees, rich fields, wild goats (black tail) develop there, like sheep.
According to the data, the last of them, who lived in Syrovark, was caught by Aral fishermen in 1848
Becchurin says he saw wild horses in the area
Taking into account such historical, cultural and physical-geographical location of Kyzylorda region it is possible to consider as potential of tourism development of this region
Head of country N
Nazarbayev spoke about his message to the people and the development of tourism in the Kazakhstan-2030 program
Tourism development needs to be turned into an income-generating industry in the country's economy
To this end, extensive use of tourism opportunities in the republic and the creation of tourism infrastructure in accordance with international standards
In our country there is an opportunity to travel to picturesque places of nature
Road links with a large number of historical and cultural monuments found in the region
The situation attracts the attention of travelers, including Kyzylorda region differs from other regions of the republic in socio-economic and historical conditions of nature
This region is physically and geographically located within the Turan lowland on the western slope of Karatau in the lower reaches of the Syr Darya River
The northern branch of the Great Silk Road passes through the territory of the region
Through it, silk of China and precious stones of India are supplied to Great Siberia in Europe
In the early Middle Ages, many great states dominated Cheese
Among them were the countries of Ogyz Deshti-Kipshak with a developed economy
On the territory of the region there are places in cities such as Ozhanak - Zhankent Barshynkent Sauran Ozgent Accorgan was a large trade and political center of the Kypchak state
Depending on the interest and specialties of tourists in the region, it is possible to organize ecotourism and ethnotourism in the cultural and art direction of the historical direction
In general, Kyzylorda region has more natural and socio-economic recreational resources that use tourist and excursion purposes
Cheese, which settled Syr Darya in the south-west of the country, has a unique nature and uniqueness, not unlike another region
One of the districts of Kyzylorda region, distinguished by its natural system - Aral
Aral district - an administrative-territorial unit located in the north-west of the Kyzylorda region
Founded in 1938
Area - 551 thousand km ²
Total population 692 thousand people
In the area of ​ ​ 58 settlements combined into 1 urban 2 village and 12 rural districts
The center of the district is the city of Aral [2]
In the west and north of the district with the Shalkar Irgiz district of the Aktobe region in the northeast it borders with the Ulytau district of the Karaganda region in the east with the Kazalinsky district of the region in the south with the Republic of Karakalpak
The territory of the district lies almost in the north of the Turan lowland in the Aral district
Consists of a flat landscape occupying the province of Northern Aral
In the northwest are elevated ridges and mountains
The highest point of the area of ​ ​ the region is a mountain lying northwest of Shevchenko Bay (324 m)
There are several sand fields
These are the sands of Aral Karakuma Thin sand Darbas in the central part of Barsh in the north of Maly Borsuk sand in the northwest
On the coast of the Aral Sea are the peninsula Kokral Koktyrnak Barsakelmes Shubar tarayz Kulanda Chernyshev Tushybas Shevchenko Butakov Saryshyganak and Berg
On the peninsula there are other horns Isenaral Uzynaral Karatobe Domalak Aidarli
It is also worth noting separately the historical and cultural objects that are the basis for the development of tourism in the Aral Sea region: Kerderinsky mazar is a historical and cultural object at the bottom of the Aral Sea
In 2001, the archaeological expedition "Aral-2001" (head archaeologist T.
Mamiev) 75 km south-west of the village of Karatereng, Aral region
As a result of archaeological exploration, it was found that the relic is a mausoleum
Total volume 50 m ² height 2 meters
Brick bricks with broken carvings architectural materials filled with large stones
Human remains discovered in the west and north of the main foundation

They ruled the Khorezm country in the I-V centuries

He is an outstanding art critic L.
As Rampel shows, the work of civilization of the X-XIII centuries arose due to the intervention of nomadic Turks in Khorezm, who became close to the art of Arab countries in the IX-X centuries
Data from the Kerderi mausoleum found on the edge of the Aral Sea indicate that the findings of the study indicate a vivid work of Turkic culture of the X-XIII centuries
This is a historical and geographical ecological cultural philosophical type related to the history of the Aral Sea region
introduces a new approach to questions [3]
Begim-Ana Tower - a monument of architectural art, preserved from about 10-12 centuries
It is located at a distance of 35 km southeast of the village of Zhanakurylys
Investigated by the expedition of the Kazakhstan Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments in 1979
According to legend, the wife of Emir Begim-Ana Zhankent became a victim of slander
The tower is built of raw brick with two rows of fried brick (23x26x6)
Height 105 meters
The top of the octagonal prism, slightly rushing up, ended with a pyramid
Up to the average level (about 55-6m) the tower pillar has a room as a whole above
Entrance to this room is possible through the beam opening on the east side
There is an assumption that the tower could be built for a monument or to inspect the guard of any kind of alarm
Medieval towers of this type (Uzyntam Sarmankos) in Kazakhstan are not so common, and in Central Asia they are practically absent
However, such monuments, known as the "Mausoleum with Towers" (after the XIII-XIV centuries), became widespread in Iran and Turkey in Azerbaijan
This may happen due to the displacement of the Turkic tribes of the Aral region to these countries
In 1989, the Begim-Ana tower was reconstructed
Aral Sea - a closed lake located on the eastern outskirts of Ustirt in the desert zone of the Turan depression in the land of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan (Kyzylorda and Aktobe regions)
Before intensive anthropogenic actions in the region (1960-1980
) lies at an altitude of 530 m above world sea level
The water intake area of ​ ​ this level is 661 thousand km ² (including islands), the water volume of 1064 km ³, the average depth of 161 m (the deepest 67 m) was 420 km ²
During the continuous extraction of water for economic purposes in 1998, the sea level decreased by 18 meters
As a result, the sea was divided into two reservoirs - Big Island and Small Island [4]
The Aral Sea has been known since antiquity
Ancient Greeks and Romans consider the sea the "Saki Gulf" of the Caspian Sea
Macedonian called the sea Ox (Greek name Ox-Syr Darya)
Ptolemy later determined its geographical location
The Aral Sea has names such as the Kerdery Sea in the Khorezm Sea
Arab travelers Ibn Ruste (X g
) also in the records of Abilgaz there are data on the Aral Sea
A comprehensive study of marine nature began during the policy of the Russian Empire on the colonization of the East
In the years 1848-1849, a naval sailor and explorer A.
Butakov's expedition first explored the reservoirs of the Aral Sea, as a result of which in 1850 the first complete map of the Aral Sea was compiled
Complex geographical and hydrological studies of the sea and its environs in 1900-1903 L
Conducted under the leadership of Berg
In subsequent years, many research and design institutes were covered by the study of the sea
A number of foreign research institutions of Kazakhstan also discussed issues of Aral Sea study
After there were 1,100 groups of islands in the Aral Sea with a total area of ​ ​ about 2,235 km ² (35% of the reservoir), a number of them turned into a peninsula and were annexed to land
The largest islands under Kokoral Barsayames Revival
In the north there are high and floodplain shores
Their deep bays and cut eastern shores are found in flat and sandy small bays and coastal islands
The southern coast consists of the name Amu Darya on the western side, with a slight cut consisting of peripheral layers of Ustirt up to 250 meters high
The 2 largest rivers of Central Asia (Amudaria and Syr Darya) flow into the Aral Sea
Aral Sea in the middle of the Cainazoic era
21 million.
1,200 years ago, the Island joined the Caspian Sea
Because from a depth of 80 meters from the modern Blonde Akespa, the remains of a whale, the large son of a red fish that lived during the time of Oligocene, were discovered on the teristic surface of the sea
This suggests that the sea connects to the ocean
Thus, the study of this reservoir, which is currently attracting the attention of the countries of the world, has continued since now.
Therefore, it is easy to determine the evolution of the development of the Aral Sea basin and its coast, comparing ancient research and modern new data, as well as the nature of change over the centuries
For example, in ancient times, the Aral Sea was known to many countries
Because the data of Arab scientists of the 9th-10th centuries - Ibn-Khordadbeh Ibn-Rusten Masudi Istakhri - are very valuable
In these works you can learn about the size and shape of the shores of the Island of that time
Ibn-Khordabeh in the work "Kitabi-al-masalik Val-mamlik" (Book of Travel and States) calls the Ceyhun Sea of ​ ​ Lake Aral Kurder
And the fact that Ibn-Rusten wrote about Amudaria and the Aral Sea more accurately suggests that according to his data, the area of ​ ​ the Aral Sea is 80 farces, that is, one farce-6 kilometers
Ridges on the main coast of the sea are called Siyakuhs (black mountains)
And the right bank is swampy, a dense forest grew there
That is, the mentioned Siyakukh - can be a vertical eye of the urine
The height of some points reaches 190 meters
Arab geographer Istakhri called the Aral Sea
Called Lake Khorezm and gave information about Syr Darya
Istahri says: "There are 100 farsahs around the lake
Jeyhun Ilash (Syr Darya) and other rivers flow into the salty lake "
The Aral Sea is also described in the manuscript "Regions of the World from East to West," written in Persian by an unknown author who lived in the 10th century
It indicates that the sea area is 300 farsahs, and the shores are sandy
Travelers also wrote that those who left information about the Aral Sea were not seen mainly by those who specifically explored the sea, but by travelers who collected small data on global literature
Therefore, it can be said that there were no specific scientific studies about the Aral Sea at this time
However, the reflection of some features of the natural conditions of this period allows us to determine the nature of the change in the nature of the modern region
Collection of specific documentary information about the Aral Sea, the beginning of special studies (XVII-XIX centuries.
) at the turn of the century
Because the current name Aral has been given since the 17th century
That is, in 1740-1741, Ivan Murain was one of the first to take part in the study of Syr Darya and the Aral Sea, for the first time writing a map made as a result of a special survey of the eastern coast of the Aral Sea with great accuracy
The last complete research on the Aral Sea dates back to 1946-1950
That is, according to these data, the longest part of the sea with an area of ​ ​ 66 thousand square kilometers is 424 kilometers, and the average depth of 292 kilometers is 161 meters, the deepest is 68 meters
But on the sea, which really remains today, there are about 15-20 thousand square kilometers of water bodies
Thus, the assumption that for the first time in the region in 2001 the Aral Sea became the place of the city due to such drying of the sea became a reality these days
At one time, some old captains of navigation heard about it from themselves
And now that the sea was stretched and the shores began to open at different levels, now it is becoming more noticeable
Also evidence of this is that the western surface of the island of Barsakelmes is connected to the continent, which is known from the history of the Aral Sea until 1592
Separated from land due to sea water rise
Also, as mentioned above, according to Arab scientists of the same morning, the volume of the sea changed in the same binary volume.
For example, 80 100 and 300 farces
If one farce has 6 kilometers, then the largest volume of the sea or only 300 x 6 = 1800 kilometers
This indicates a low sea level compared to the same 1950
In this regard, in a word, it is obvious that the island of Barsakelmes continues on land until 1592
And all that we are talking about will get appropriate places in our region
For example, the Aral disaster zone can be attributed to the Baikonur space zone and the dangerous island of Vozrozhdenie
Consequently, adverse environmental effects cause significant damage to the health of the population of the region [5]
Separately, it is worth noting that the Aral region is located in the ecological zone (1863 settlements with a population of 178 thousand people)
The Aral Sea, which ranks fourth in size among the lakes of the common planet, is gradually disappearing from the surface these days
Because, still, there are about 66 thousand square kilometers of water bodies
Scientists believe that the sea will be completely destroyed in 2015
Only the isolated Northern Aral Sea (Small Island Sea) is regulated by human actions
Lake Kamystybas - the largest lake in the Aral region
Located on the left bank of the Syr Darya River
Located on the right bank of the Syr Darya, 2 km west of the Kamystybas railway station
The lake is extended in a latitudinal direction by 30 km wide 5-8 km
Maximum depth 10 m
The lake lies at an altitude of 581 m above sea level, the length of the coast is 178 km 1156 km
The lake is replenished by the Towip Jarma Canal
There are several lakes around it, such as Laikol Kayazdy Jalangash Rayym
The eastern shore is sandy
Southern alpine (up to 23 m) North coast reaches a height of 5 m
The southwest coast of the plain continues with Syr Darya
There are 15 species of fish
Main: cakes for sazan
In the city there is a nursery "Koszhar" for growing small young animals
Its annual production capacity is 134 million young people (2005)
Duck goose on the lake
birds are found among cane ondatra
Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve
In our country, 10 state nature reserves with a total area of ​ ​ 1,075,498 hectares
One of them is the Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve, located in the desert-desert zone
Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve, located on the former island of Barsakelmes in the northwestern part of the Aral Sea, with a total area of ​ ​ 16795 hectares
Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve was founded in 1929 as a reserve for the production of precious furs
Due to the sharp decline of the Aral Sea and the restriction of the Eastern part of the Barsakelmes Reserve with land, the administration of the reserve raised a difficult issue
In search of good pastures and reservoirs, ungulates are settled in new territories
In this regard, a scientific technical and economic examination was prepared with the financing of the Fund for Saving the Aral Sea for the accession of these new territories to the reserve
Based on this examination, the territory of the Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve from January 1, 2006 increased from 16,795 hectares to 160,826 hectares in accordance with Government Decree No. 1162 of November 25, 2005
In 1953, he was sent from the Badkhyz reserve of Turkmenistan to the territory of the reserve in order to acclimatize recent kulans
From 1929 to 1970, 7 species of animals were sent to the reserve in order to acclimatize rabbits: coolies of black-earth wild boar
All of them began to better adapt to the natural conditions of the island and increase
Currently, the Barsakelmes State Nature Reserve consists of two cluster sites: the Barsakelmes site, the former Barsakelmes island and the adjacent Aral Sea, with an area of ​ ​ 50884 hectares.
This section consists of 2 inspection zones
All infrastructure collected in the central estate on the Barsakelmes site
Administratively belongs to the Aral district of the Kyzylorda region and is located at a distance of 180 km southwest of the city of Aralsk
The Kaskakulan site includes the former east coast and the islands of the Aral Sea with an area of ​ ​ 109942 hectares
This site consists of 6 inspection zones and on the territory of the reserve there are wells that are the main water sources of ungulates
There is an extensive saxaul forest of natural growth
Kazakhstan is closely connected with nomadic and settled world
The land of ancient civilization with important trade routes (the Great Silk Road) connecting East and West, which developed and flourished due to the mutual influence of cultures and religions with a unique history, different from the great powerful empires and states formed after their creation and destruction and re-renewal from the ashes
The Republic of Kazakhstan is currently in a good position to exploit the potential of ecotourism
To this end, in the Barsakelmes Reserve, by increasing the volume of inbound tourism and domestic tourism, create a promising environmental tourism system that will be able to ensure a steady growth in state and population incomes with the employment of local residents of nearby settlements of the reserve (Karatereng Tastak Karashalang Bugen Zhanakurylys)
As mentioned above, the Aral region has the opportunity to contribute to this
For example: religious and cognitive direction of the ecological route "Begim Ana-Kaskakulan" and motor transport
Route time 2 days depending on the length of the road with a length of 68 km
Route life from April 1 to October 1
Maximum number of people in group 5
2 groups per week can take 8 groups per month 48 groups per year
You can also establish unorganized domestic tourism on the coast of Lake Kambash with the involvement of local residents, preserve a gentle ecosystem and develop beach tourism in the area
This system, in turn, consists in providing additional sources of income to the State and indigenous people by supporting their failure to eliminate the ecosystem in the Lake Kambash system
To organize a beach tourist destination on the shores of Lake Kambash, it is necessary, first of all, to develop the infrastructure of state organizations with the involvement of representatives of small and medium-sized businesses in non-state organizations
Upon arrival in the Aral Sea Zone
measures should be taken to develop tourist facilities, taking into account the importance of their improvement
We know that the Aral disaster is world famous
But so you can't be black
This accident caused the influx of foreign tourists
According to the statistics of the migration police department of the Aral region, every year the influx of foreign tourists to the city of Aralsk increases for various purposes
That is, there is demand
It is necessary to develop tourism, increasing supply, without losing these requests

Main words: active type of tourism sports tourism mountain tourism camping hike tourism technology tactics tourism rehabilitation camping direction safety
The route nature of mountain tourism in tourism activities differs from many activities
In this regard, one of the most important practical tasks in many types of tourism is the creation of camping programs and optimal directions
Does not require the equal creation of destinations for all types of tourism, especially the creation of principles of technology-oriented traditional types of tourism
On a wide scale, tourism covers many types of travel and recreation, such as fairly sustainable (recreational ski tourism) and nature-oriented (excursion tourism cognitive tourism)
In this regard, the creation of the optimal direction in active sports and mountain tourism is necessary not only to improve and get impressions, but also to ensure the safety of tourists in mountain conditions, which is the most relevant and productive issue of geographical knowledge.
Due to the nature of the voluntary organization of a tourist trip, sports tourism is characterized by a steam character
The availability of convenient forms and institutional mechanisms for active mountain and sports tourism contributes to the sustainable and rapid development of these activities.
That is, the results of the organization will be reflected in connection with the great experience and business skills of tourist travel
One of such methodological results enabling the development of mountain tourism is geography orientation, improvement of work with a map and compos is due to each tourist group [1]
Sports tourism in the system of multi-level tourism is a combination of geography and sports in terms of its features and significance
He notes that interest in environmental knowledge covers a large area and depends on the geographical factors of the tourism technology program
Its symbolism and content belong to the classic type of tourism from the point of view of society
The nature of targeted activity, in which theoretical and practical actions in sports and mountain tourism have become different at the present stage, can be useful for types of tourism with similar positions in relation to tourist equipment and transport
New concepts, such as environmentally active nature-oriented tourism, are close to sporting mountain tourism
School child and adolescent tourism has many similarities with the category and concepts studied
The above types of tourism will be closely related to geographical science, adhering to the rules of sports tourism
Methodologically, it is necessary to analyze the belonging of mountain and sports tourism to the system of geographical sciences and its relation to geographical qualifications and determine it
The geography of sports tourism includes recreational geography on a small scale
In particular, mountain and sports tourism will choose extreme places for people in the natural environment
For sporting trips in places located at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level, recreational activities are considered suitable
Tourism scientist Professor S.
According to Erdauletov, "sports tourism is based on the principles of socio-economic and physical geography related to natural orientation"
Also M
According to Trofimov, "sports tourism is included in the applied sections of geography and general geography"
One of the categories adopted in geographical science that allows you to focus on mountain tourism is the concept of "environment recreational system"
In the study of many tourist phenomena and trends, this platform is of great importance for the development of mountain tourism, aimed at linking various elements to the space, such as tourist resource bases and route grids during hiking [2]
Natural conditions are reflected in the geographical patterns of distribution and territorial organization of mountain and sports tourism, as well as in the tactical model of technical means and trips
Because many campaigns are held in the highlands around Almaty.
Each territory is distinguished by hemorphological climatic high-altitude infrastructural political ethnographic and other features
In this regard, for each territory there will be convenient aesthetically attractive types of travel, allowing them to be classified according to different parameters
Therefore, for each mountain area, you can offer several optimal mountain trips that are considered suitable for a tourist trip
The most suitable method of these trips is to provide any individual or several types of tourism
Such a mountain category of complexity, allowing to extend throughout the tourist area, will also be real
In accordance with these Rules, scientists studying mountain tourism, on the basis of organized expeditionary research and travel, propose a periodic method for assessing the opportunities for the development of territorial sports and mountain tourism depending on the complexity of tourist mountain hiking [3]
It will allow you to choose the most convenient types of tourist tourism, corresponding to the categories of complexity of the tourist route, suitable for organizing attractive and active tourist trips
The presented understanding of suitable types of trips of sports and mountain tourism determines the types of optimal and safe for each territory, which allows you to familiarize yourself with the geography
A hiking chain suitable for mountain tourism should pass through sights passing on both sides of the main diving ridge and popular tourist attractions with a safe complexity of no more than the established standard for range and duration
In turn, the Route Form Program in this area should reflect the features of attractiveness, the possibility of providing transport with a combination of natural barriers
The direction of the tourist trip, suitable for tourism, determines the requirements for travellers in this territory, its geographical knowledge of the category of development of tourist methods-approaches
This will ensure safe risk management activities in sports and mountain tourism [4]
Therefore, the analysis of theoretical tactical and technical overtones of mountain tourism based on geographical knowledge on the formation of a network of tourist trips in the territory will allow scientifically and methodically correctly solving issues of assessing and using tourist recreational resources of mountain areas

Animation programs for children with animated animation programs for animated animation, animated animation programs for children
The concept of "animation" comes from the Latin word (anima - wind of air; animatus - revival) and revitalization means the activation of the spirit
Animation is a peculiar type of services aimed at improving the quality of services, as well as a peculiar form of attracting guests and their acquaintances, also designed to sell a tourist product on the market to increase the profit and profit of the turbine business
Hotel animation is one of the effective ways to attract guests to the hotel
This will have a positive impact on the hotel as a whole.
This is a form of providing additional services to one consumer, the purpose of which is to awaken the positive emotions of guests so that they can enjoy their holidays and return to this hotel again.
Tourist animation is a tourist service that participates in active tourism in the provision of these services
He noted that the animator will participate in direct contact with tourists along with the animation program of the tourist complex.
In this tourist complex, one of the types of tourist activities carried out on cruise ships on the train, it mixes tourists with various events by participating in a specially created leisure program
Tourist animation is an important part of the joint activity of the tourist enterprise, an important component of the tourist product
The goal of the tourism animation in the end is the wellness satisfaction of the tourist, the restoration of the physical and moral strength of his positive moods
Here is an important recreational function of tourist animation
Preconditions for tourism animation Negative effects of industrialization and urbanization
The consequences of rapid technological development (industrialization) include factors such as daily fencing with technology, environmental pollution, work overnight, lack of time and strength in physical and mentally tired creativity and favorite business (hobby)
Urbanization also produced various negative effects: life loads with an increased high density of the city's population, a tense (anonymous) connection with many people in the city
Opponents of such negative influences want to leave the city into pure nature, reaching spiritual values ​ ​ (history, art), transforming their life feelings, realizing new people who experience physical and mental fatigue, being in a state of rest and entertainment surrounded by friends
As a result, the demand for such tourist services as hobby tours, excursion and entertainment routes focused on environmental nature, sports, entertainment and treatment and restoration services has increased [1]
Thus, the changing nature of the work and educational activities of modern children, associated with industrialization and urbanization, changed its need for recreation, respectively, the content of the tourist product
In addition to accommodation and nutrition, other elements aimed at meeting the need for emotional relaxation in interesting and fun leisure activities were included in the entertainment.
In the terminology of tourist action and service in the hotel, the concept of "tourist animation" appeared, a type of action aimed at meeting the animated needs of a tourist
Tourist animation is aimed directly at performing two functions within the three main recreational services (medical rehabilitation and cognition) - sports and recreational and cognitive
Where appropriate, its treatment activities are also carried out indirectly
In the practice of animation, the following tourism animation services can be noted for the targeted design of animation programs
making it possible to move from adaptive everyday conditions to free leisure;
exempting a compensatory person from physical and mental fatigue from everyday life;
forming positive emotions that stabilize and educate mental stability;
rehabilitation is aimed at restoring and developing the physical strength of a person weakened by everyday work;
information state zone of people and
providing an opportunity to obtain new information;
Enabling the validation of knowledge about the world of education;
improving intellectual and physical maturity;
the tourist state through advertising programs allows you to make the tourist complex an advertiser of a tourist company
This variety of tourism animation functions contributed to the variety of animation activities, as well as the variety of animation programs and events
"Animation" "recreational animation" "hotel animation" differs from the concept of "tourist animation" by a large number of animation programs and types of actions
Recreational animation - a type of leisure activity aimed at restoring the spiritual and physical strength of a person
Programs implemented for recreational purposes can be implemented by tourist enterprises with tourists and cocoons, as well as spend leisure time with local residents
This concept of "recreational animation" means "tourist animation"
and means a broader concept than "hotel animation"
Tourist and hotel animation is closely related to recreational animation, since the main role of animation programs in sanatoriums, as well as in special animation tours in hotels, is to improve vacationers, increase their daily activities, that is, restore vitality and energy
Tourist animation is a tourist service that provides tourists with active activity in the provision of these services
When preparing animated programs, such features as the age of tourists, gender, nationality, as well as the activity of tourist participation are taken into account
Garanin tourist animations are distinguished in the main form by their importance and the volume of animation programs in the general travel program (in the tourist product)
From a systemic point of view, tourist animation is the satisfaction of specific tourist needs in entertainment, allowing the movement to culture to spend better time on creativity
All these needs should have the following types of animation that meet their child tourism needs specific to children:
animation in motion - meets the needs of a young person in movement, which is combined with entertainment and good time;
animation through the passage of the head - a feeling of new uncertainty satisfies the need to overcome new discoveries during the intervention process, as well as difficulties;
cultural animation - meets the needs of the state for the spiritual development of children through access to cultural and historical monuments and modern cultural values ​ ​ of the population of the region;
creative animation - meets the needs of children in demonstrating their opportunities for creativity and contacts with people who are spiritually close to each other through joint creativity;
animation through communication - satisfies the needs of people to communicate with new interesting people in revealing the inner soul and self-knowledge through relationships
Actual animation programs are often complex, and the above-mentioned animation programs are integral elements of these programs
Animation programs, along with entertainment events, accompany various sports games, training and competitions
This compatibility makes these programs more interesting and useful for promoting health recovery, so in a combination of tourist animation and sports, recovery efficiency is achieved - recovery
When organizing animation programs, it is necessary to take into account the characteristics characteristic of various age categories of vacationers at tourist sites
Children are the most active people for them
the main thing is to spend your vacation as fun and interesting as possible
During this period of life, infants and adolescents are physically ripe, their behavior and attitude to life echo
The main activities at this stage are training and productive work, and a lot of effort is required
However, at this time, children carry energy, so the children's leisure program can include evenings and dance evenings, auction festivals and shows, sports games, Olympiads, debates, theatrical performances, as well as various games
Animation activities at tourist enterprises should be very carefully regulated and organized both financially and methodically
Let's take a look at animation technology
The technology of creating animation programs is a set of methods of the animator's work, organizing this work, using special technical means (facilities)
The reason for this complex and multifaceted process is that creating animated programs solves the following problems: economic accounting of the prices of each program and creative transformation of programmed animated events upon their completion
This process is a complete integrated system of interaction of all components
The technology for creating an animation program for children consists of several systems connected to each other as systems
Consider them separately:
Organization of interaction between economic and technical advertising departments of the organizational and animation team;
Instructor-methodical - compiling event scenarios with excursion texts, compiling hiking routes for choosing sports games and competitions;
Directorial - drawing up plans for preparing for the distribution of roles;
Equipping of technical facilities (facilities)
) musical support for lighting the details of the scenery and t for the animated event (venue (script)
to prepare
All listed systems form a technology system that serves as the basis for the operation of the animation service
An animated action is a true and special world with its characteristic rules, which creates professionals to attract more people to the process of their creation
Here there are characteristic septic patterns of the activity of animated actions
The process of creating animation programs includes the following elements:
form of action - serviced tourist (groups and individuals);
action subject - leading specialist of animation service;
animation action, including all components - subject response to object [2]
The success of the animation program largely depends on a properly organized advertising campaign
The game occupies an important place in the animation program
The game is a means of relaxing people with entertaining intervention
During the game, the person gets satisfaction and the nervous system relaxes
The game is characterized by an active cognitive character, which contributes to the aesthetic education of the mind and physical development
With the help of the game, the world will be recognized, creative initiative will be trained, the ability to wake up and think will be activated
The main task of the game is human development, aimed at creative experimental activity
Game trainer gives a positive emotional charge to restore strength
All functions of the game are closely related
The main features of the game include:
with communicative-expansive action
The game covers all participants (participants - spectators), that is, it maintains an emotional connection:
action - determines the interaction of people with each other and the world around them;
compensatory - invigorating psychological loads that restore the life balance of energy;
educational - organizer of human activity
The game provides the opportunity for targeted education and training;
pedagogical didactic - developing knowledge and capabilities (training ability to receive information of different modality with attention to memory);
predictability - experimental forecasting of the future;
modeling - linking reality with impossibility;
entertainment and entertainment - turning a scientific event into an interesting state that forms a favorable atmosphere;
relaxation-positive effect of emotional loads on the crucial nervous system;
psychotechnical - guiding the player's psyche to accept a large amount of information;
development - an adjuster of personality self-realization in game models of life situations
Two important factors are combined in gaming activity: on the one hand, players develop physically, interfering in practical activity; and on the other hand, moral and aesthetic satisfaction with this act deepens the knowledge of the world in life
All this has a positive effect on the education of the person as a whole when it ends [3]
Thus, when considering the possibility of using an animation program in children's tourism, they are determined
The tourist company is a place for the provision of tourist services, in the activities of which tourists are also actively involved
The duties of the animator are based on the participation of tourists and their personal contact in the recreational activities provided by the ship's animation program.
A variety of tourist creativity will be performed on a cruise for shipping in the hotel, which invites tourists to participate in various programs
The animation program is aimed at meeting special tourist needs, the movement will be held in creative recreational evenings of culture
All such needs are in children, i.e. there are appropriate types of animation that meet the needs of children's tourism
When considering the specifics of the organization of animation programs in various areas of children's tourism, the following conditions for their organization are determined:
Differential treatment of the socio-cultural needs of children with interests in different groups;
inclusion of well-known leisure activities in the children's environment in the animation program of tours;
style unit between the main tour program of the tour and its animated part
Main words: diaspora irredent diasporology, field culture, types of diaspora demographic growth, current geopolitical situation, national interests of oralmans population geographical location of oralmans
Today, about 5 million Kazakh irredents and diasporas live in 40 countries of the world
However, the exact quantity is incomplete
Why do we divide them into irredents and diaspora, because now and on the part of the government in the private scientific environment of Kazakhs in general they call the Kazakh diaspora
This is wrong
Because both concepts give the other two magans
We know that the word diaspora in Greek means "spraying"
This is the name of the diaspora of people formed due to the relocation of part of the population from their place of residence to other countries for various reasons
The role and importance of the diaspora are changing as populations who do not move from their land in the world, as they are now, are global in political economic and cultural trends
It can be a source of various provocations along with enhanced cooperation among States [1]
Therefore, studying the history of diaspora development is an important tool for implementing the foreign policy of many countries
At this stage, science appeared - diasporology, studying the history and dynamics of the formation and change of the diaspora
He will summarize historical facts and events about the causes and periods of the formation of the diaspora, as well as detailed information on the number and composition of the traditions of their culture and profession
Second, diasporology is the science of the methods of adaptation and survival of a people into a cultural ethnic environment with the history of periods and directions of formation outside the historical homeland [2]
Based on this branch of science, you can learn about the following types of diaspora formation:
forced (Jewish Armenian Irish Russian Kazakh
effects of colonial migration (British German Portuguese Russian);
labour migration (Chinese Indian and
professional (business trade) migration (Japanese Chinese and
"cultural" migration (Latin American Indian China)
Today, about 5 million Kazakh diasporas live in 40 countries [3]
And the word irredent means citizens living in a region that is a tarihiota of ancestors who, due to socio-political changes, are in the border division.
Summarizing these two different concepts, China
Kazakhs in Mongolia of Russia and Central Asia can be called a diaspora, except as irredents, our compatriots living in neighboring countries
We have compatriots in these two different categories
However, some of our scientists and political scientists note that Kazakhs abroad have the common name "Kazakh diaspora"
Such a name is scientifically wrong
Because because of historical circumstances, how the brothers who were on the front lines at the border units "scattered," we attribute them to the number of diasporas
Have they not been Cossack steppes for a long time? Therefore, we must treat them on the basis of the category of irrenets
Then there will be justice
And the word of the irredents can be called Kazakh or short "Settlers"
Kazakhs - diasporas - they can be called "immigrants" or "muhajirs"
We have to spread each other
Otherwise, Kazakh parent lands will be identical to what we ourselves recognize as foreign land
Reason for 1997
The Act of 11 July on languages in the Republic of Kazakhstan states:
"the diaspora is part of the population living outside their historical homeland (ethnic group)" [4]
Help issued
According to the latest data, there are 11 million 1 thousand 739 Kazakhs in the country, including 5 million Kazakhs located abroad, and 16 million Kazakhs worldwide
This is the population of one large city of the country with a large population
And in the land we occupy the 9th place out of 200 countries of the world [5]
Why are few people so empty? He has several reasons
One is the connection with the economic, social and political geographical location of the country
Ancestors who contributed to human civilization in a city engaged in nomadic and visiting cattle breeding in a vast territory inhabited in the center of Eurasia, and left stylized manuscripts of great powers on the political map of the world, fell into the sakan of history
The proportionate properties of the West and East showed an example of mixed cultured meat
They combine Mongolian elements made by ancient European and introductory [6]
However, the burdens of the Kazakh peoples between the XVII-XVIII centuries and about three centuries until the middle of the XX century became the basis for the formation of the Kazakh diaspora and irredents
In these historical periods, many countries have never encountered the interests of the Kazakh people by mutual agreement
Diaspora developed during the persecution of the Kazakh people among world species
It includes the Head of State N.
Nazarbayeva:
Kazakhs scattered face to face so that one people knew that one nation was a country
There is probably no people who have not seen colonialism on Earth, but have not been a Kazakh for a century, "he said [7]
As you know, the geographical environment has a great influence on the philosophy of life on human health in the culture of peace, from this point of view there is a high property of the Kazakh people to adapt to any environment created in a special geographical environment.
To this end, the Kazakh people still maintain their national diaries, although they constitute the smallest groups in these countries, although they extend to many countries of the world.
If there were a people with poor adaptation, then the disappearance of our people as a nation would not be surprising
After the Republic of Kazakhstan gained sovereignty, many discoveries and changes occurred in the life of society and the life and heritage of foreign Kazakhs
A new analysis of the history and culture of our people has appeared
This was facilitated by the support and initiative of the Head of State and the Government
The Head of State also noted that at the Second World Kurultai of Kazakhs in Turkestan on October 2002, 23:
And thinking about this, the question of what awaits tomorrow our brothers, who make up a third of Kazakhs around the world living in more than 40 foreign countries, unwittingly wakes up "[8]
Thanks to such appeals and a special program of the government for the period from January 1991 to January 1 2015 259,159 families or 952,882 ethnic Kazakhs (including 3792 families or 8247 people in 2014) returned to their historical homeland and received the status of oralman
This is 55% of the total population of the country
If we talk about the geographical specificity of these brothers, then the majority or 615 percent - from Uzbekistan, of course, because of this, our citizens stuck abroad as a result of the border agreement between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan can get into this figure.
This is followed by 143% - from China 93% - from Mongolia 68% - from Turkmenistan 46% - from Russia and 35% - from other countries.
212% of them - to South Kazakhstan region
163% - Almaty region, 13% - Mangistau region, 94% - Zhambyl region, 401% - other regions of the country
At 556 working ages, the share of pensioners under 18 years old - 399% was only 45%
902 per cent of Oralmans, including general secondary education and higher education [9]
Land volume of the Republic of Kazakhstan 2
900 square kilometers - the largest inland land country in the world in ninth place in the world
The population as of September 1, 2013 amounted to 17 million 75 thousand people and takes 61st place in the overall standings around the world
The population density is 63 people.
That is, the ratio 9:61 can be attributed to the negative proportional ratio 1:68
This disturbing form of communication
In addition, Kazakhstan has an important geopolitical position
The preservation and strengthening of national sovereignty in such a tense political and economic situation as it is now is of great importance on the agenda
Therefore, the growth of the quantitative share of the Kazakh population of Kazakhstan is a necessary demand
I believe that the political stability on Kazakh soil, the integrity of our country, the spatially effective location of the economy, to form the minimum level of education and health of transport routes of infrastructure, the population of our country is 50 million.
must be
Government plans to increase population to 25 million people by 2050
It is undeniable that this noble initiative contributes to the return of compatriots from abroad to the country
Kazakhstan has 11 million Kazakhs scattered in more than 40 countries
155-16 million Kazakhs worldwide, including 1 thousand 739 Kazakhs
The annual growth of the modern population of Kazakhstan is 200 million people, counting 1 thousand people
a person will need about 5 years to grow
If for 20 years the total number of compatriots who returned to the country is 1 million people
There is complete evidence that with the arrival of compatriots called oralmans, the 5-year natural growth of the population of Kazakhstan increased due to oralmans
In addition to the quantitative growth of compatriots, the development of the national language and culture will contribute to strengthening foreign policy and social ties to the prosperity of the economy and economy.
However, ignoring such a potential or neglect and inability to use so much of its wealth is a great criticism in our country
It is necessary to raise complex issues of the modern diaspora not only from the point of view of state sovereignty, national interests, our national unity
It is a very necessary research attempt to restore social justice, correct the mistake of the past, protect human rights, as well as national security
First, we will answer questions about how many Kazakh disparate diasporas are left, where and no matter how they are there
This is one of the main issues of our independent demographic policy as a young state
In such a difficult political situation as now, the main task for our country is to perpetuate the political and territorial independence of Kazakhstan
The need for compatriots from countries near and far abroad to participate together with the local population in this ambitious task
In modern civilized life, it will necessarily consider and solve various issues in scientific and diplomatic terms
It is clear that policy decisions and actions taken without scientific research are exhaustive
In this sense, the time has come to systematically consider foreign Kazakhs in the framework of special scientific research organizations

Economic growth of agro-industrial complex Manufacturing infrastructure Investment and credit agricultural machinery entrepreneur economic effect
One of the most important factors of Kazakhstan's economy development is agriculture
The level of development of the agricultural sector is still poorly developed, despite the country's climatic conditions and financial assistance
However, we hope that in the future it will develop
For the country, agriculture is an important branch of the national economy, allowing sustainable growth of national production to increase labor productivity and develop infrastructure
Therefore, accelerated agricultural development is an urgent task
To do this, full state support and assistance in this area must be created so that entrepreneurs are given real opportunities and affordable loans for the use of natural resources
To achieve high economic performance of the republic, it is necessary to carefully monitor the level of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production
To increase the efficiency of the economy, the state should allocate the necessary funds without providing the material and technical base of research organizations, monitoring the level of funding for research and development work in the field of the agro-industrial complex
If indicators of this level are provided, the possibility of further growth of the agro-industrial complex will be provided [1]
In connection with the development of the agro-industrial complex, the Government announced the Development Strategy of Kazakhstan until 2030
This future-oriented message focuses on the development of agriculture in the real sector of the economy [2]
Head of State pays special attention to agricultural development
For example, on January 27, 2012, in his traditional message to the people "Socio-economic modernization - the main course of development of Kazakhstan," he gave instructions in ten areas
One of the most important directions of the Address is the development of agriculture [4]
The formation and development of a competitive agro-industrial complex in order to fulfill these tasks should comply with the international quality management and modernization system
To this end, it is necessary to consider new ways and means of improving production efficiency and effective management of the agro-industrial complex, taking into account the diversity of types of agricultural enterprises and their forms of management and legal and organizational forms.
Therefore, having studied the state of the country's agro-industrial complex in crisis and subsequent times, improving production efficiency, increasing the volume of products, improving quality and improving its competitiveness in accordance with modern requirements, the current current issue [5]
In today's economic environment, there is a need to find and apply effective ways and methods of management and economic stimulus at all levels in order to improve the efficiency of agricultural production.
Adaptation to market conditions - the leading conditions for improving efficiency are increased indicators of agricultural production, in particular, growth in the volume of quality products, increase in labor productivity indicators, formation of effective systems for the implementation of production of exchange consumption [6]
From this point of view, or one of the main directions of socio-economic development of our state is the creation of competitive agricultural products, which at our level contributes to the development of the Turara Ryskulova region [7]
Most of the population of the region works in the field of agricultural development
According to statistics, agricultural production amounted to $608 billion in 2012.
The area of ​ ​ crops reached 142 thousand hectares
64 tons of fuel and lubricants were allocated for spring field work 71,397 ears were sprinkled on an area of ​ ​ more than a hectare, the average output reached 19 centners
This figure was 33% of the grain part of Zhambyl region
The guarantee fund for the 15th anniversary of the crop feed above the grain harvesting plan has been drawn up
In 2013, the area of ​ ​ crops amounted to 18 thousand hectares
Spike crops sown on an area of ​ ​ 10 thousand hectares
Such a high income of the region is related to the ability of farmers of the region to carry out sowing on a scientific basis and the correct use of the transitional sowing system [8]
Regional leadership to attract large-scale investments in the project "Gold mining" in the amount of 525 million tenge
tenge allocated
About 150 people will work on the Kokkia gold mine, planning to build a new construction facility "Relsvarochny Enterprise" and implement a project for 8 billion tenge
According to the project "3rd branch of the gas pipeline," a compressor station was built, a project of a battery station for the use of solar energy in the region was developed and it is planned to build a plant for the production of mineral drinks
In connection with the implemented projects in the Region, 200 hectares of land are allocated from the Akyrtobe-Abdezim power plant and the Karakystak valley, which provides the entire area with energy, with a capacity of 50 mGW
$1 billion
tenge
Karakystak small water power plant with capacity of 23 MgW was commissioned [9]
Entrepreneurs of the region develop their professional work to improve the economy of the country and contribute to the socio-economic development of the country
Economic efficient economic system of regional peasant economy "Aktogan"
Manufactured products consist of a valuable production complete cluster
The peasant farm is engaged in the production of flour with the addition of enriched vitamin additives, along with the production of pasta of the cheapest exclusive variety in Kazakhstan
The products of this farm are popular in several regions of the country, and not in the region
Cost
supplies 25 tons of flour per day to the market with great demand in the market as a cheap high-quality product
Labor force "Vitreous-24" Spotless "
"Bogarnai-56" and "Nauryz-6-2" spring varieties of wheat with high yields grow elite varieties of high reproduction
Production products are equipped with modern devices for production of products in the volume of the market
Grain analysis equipment installed at the enterprise
With the help of modern equipment, the necessary analysis of grain composition is carried out within 3-4 seconds and tools for determining the initial quality of products are installed
The project for the construction of a fodder harvesting tower with a capacity of 6 thousand tons, based on the creation of a welding package and storage of bread products, was transferred for completion
Two short cut pasta production lines launched
One of the world's leading pasta companies is the production of the Italian company Italpast
Produce up to 10 tons of pasta per day
The line of automatic packaging of pasta from 200 to 5000 grams has been launched
The Aktogan peasant farm has a qualitatively equipped equipment, a separate laboratory for the production of a large-tonnage tower and pasta
The main goal of the economy is the formation of the leading industry at the level of the world standard for improving the quality of products [10]
The peasant farm "Ayan" is one of the professions that contribute to the development of the country's economy
Ensuring food security is the main issue in our country
Agriculture "Ayan," aimed at solving regional food problems, received support from the Government
Bakery "Ayan Economy" was created in 2012 to provide food to the population of the regions
Specialists produce more than 4000-5000 bread products per day
With the expansion of the economy's income, production is provided by new foreign advanced technologies and foreign-style bread stoves
Entrepreneurs of the Turara Ryskulova district entered into contracts with bakery farmers and local flour companies to stabilize bread products
Perspective plan of the enterprise equipped with new equipment, increase of market demand for production of sweet types of bakery products
Peasant farm "Kaiky"
The main profession of agriculture is agriculture and animal husbandry
Agricultural products as a high-quality product, taken into account as high-quality products, occupy successful positions in the economy of the region and the country
The production center contributes to the development of the country by exporting meat products to neighboring Kyrgyzstan and providing the city of Shymkent, South Kazakhstan region
State support for small and medium-sized enterprises provided in the region
Programs and projects created for entrepreneurs show their effectiveness
He, in turn, contributes to the development of his profession
Within the framework of the Program "Business Roadmap - 2020" several sources of medium-sized business will be opened in the region, in the process of advanced development of professions of business representatives
The region has created conditions for the development of the profession and the development of the country in the highest category
However, a number of issues remain in the area
For example, despite the large amount of groundwater in the region, the economy lacks high profits
Currently, with the optimal solution of this problem, specialists use the method of drip irrigation of underground empty artesian wells with the commissioning of tray and pipeline water systems
109 mine wells of the region are moistened by a system of 41 wells by drip irrigation of an area of ​ ​ 3,000 hectares of arable land
Specialists of the regional institution increased agricultural yields using irrigation methods in Austria
As a result of the drip irrigation method with economical use of water with an increase in the area of ​ ​ irrigated crops in the region, 4 thousand hectares of irrigated crops were transferred
Therefore, the region does not have enough specialists needed for a number of industries and peasant farms
For example, 6 tons of milk with each of the 500 heads of Alatau cows
Milk processing factory does not operate in the milk production area
A number of qualified technologies are needed for the development of the dairy processing plant
A number of technical training programmes for young people aimed at optimally addressing this problem have been conducted
Owners of regional enterprises will launch a dairy processing factory in bolashak and will supplement the level of economic growth of the country with a new flow [11]
Increase of efficiency of agro-industrial production of Turara Ryskulova district
Supporting competitiveness at a qualitatively new level for regional entrepreneurs and every citizen
If the projects planned in the future are implemented systemically, we will be able to effectively use natural resources and economic products, then we are confident that Kazakhstan will reach high development heights!

Natural wealth of one of the main national wealth of the state - its natural resources
Aksu-Dzhabagylinsky reserve - one of our riches in Kazakhstan - in the country occupying the northwestern part of the Talas Alatau (Western Tien Shan) and the Ogem ridge, in 1926
first open reserve
You will be surprised that Alash learned to think deeply in the mind of his ancestors
The unique territory of Kazakhstan in Central Asia is a unique territory all over the world, and we should always remember the exceptional merits of the pride of the nation - Turar Ryskulov, who made a special contribution to the creation of the Aksu-Dzhabagyla reserve
In July 1920, a group of scientists from Tashkent University began to enter Talas Alatau
According to updated data, in 1920, Professor Hydrobiologist A.
Under the leadership of Brodsky, scientists at Tashkent University visited the area of ​ ​ the modern reserve of Western Tien Shan
1922-1923 - the Turkestan Committee for the Protection of Natural and Art Monuments and Museums recommended organizing a reserve for scientists
M, in a group of scientists who studied the region
Dimo stressed the uniqueness of the region between the Aksu and Zhabagyly rivers
for the first time about petroglyphs in the Kaskabulak gorge - images on rock D
Kashkarov spoke about his works
In February 1925, it was decided to accelerate the creation of the Aksu-Zhabagylinsky reserve
Subsequently, until July 1926, uninterrupted operation was carried out
Soon, the leadership of the Kazakh SSR decided to create the Aksu-Dzhabagyli reserve
The decree was approved by Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin and Turar Ryskulov in Moscow
The first director of the Aksu-Zhabagylinsky reserve was the scientist Boris Petrovich Trizna, a full member of the Russian Geographical Society.
Initially, the area of ​ ​ the reserve was 30545 ha.
Thanks to Ryskulov's care, in 1935-1937 it was increased to 69826 hectares
And the current territory of the reserve is 85754 hectares
Its main zone is located on the lands of the Tulkubas Tolebi and Baidibek districts of the South Kazakhstan region and the Zhualyn district of the Zhambyl region
Also
the reserve includes two palentological parts
One covers an area of ​ ​ 126 hectares in Karabastau
second -
Area "Holy" 100 hectares
Both are located in the Baidibek district at a distance of about 120 km from the main zone of the reserve
The current area of ​ ​ the reserve, as noted above, is 85754 hectares
Of these, 21255 ha in the Tyulkubas district
in the Zhualynsky district of the Zhambyl region - 10682 ha
The center of the reserve is the village of Zhabagyly, 18-20 km east of the Tulkubas railway station
The largest river in the reserve - Aksu - reaches 10 meters wide 120 kilometers
There are more than 200 species of 550 species of animals and birds in the Aksu-Zhabagyly reserve
Most of them are listed in the Red Book
In the mountainous region, wheat grasses, celery forest, subalpine and alpine meadows grow on the slopes of the wormwood
Rocks covered with glaciers and perennial snow
Speaking of the plant world, diversity
Of the 61 moisture, 58 cereals of lead from 1400 plants of the highest stage (from medicinal plants: coniferous coniferous oaks; from technical plants: arched ragash ram; from fruits, wild apple trees spoiled with cherry currants; from fodder plants: chipped poor fox; from endemic plants: kiya karatamyr tomagashgul, twisted into yellowish chips; from relict plants: mine Minkwitz false Shame Karatau seten)
The wildlife of the reserve is also rich: 42 (barys Tien - Shan brown bear hogweed) mammals
); birds 238 (pricks pastoralist Sakaltai golden black earth sardines
); 9 (black rag snake loam with yellow liver on the liver
2 (green frog and turtle) and 2 species of fish live in cosmos rivers
Diverse invertebrate insect species
Research work in the reserve is carried out without interruptions
More than 400 works of scientists on the natural wealth of the reserve have been published

In fact, it is impossible to convey in words the beauty of the nature of this region
Visiting the reserve in the spring complained that the glossy cucumbers of Aksu-Jabagyla, apparently, are a symbol of the reserve, as well as a real behind-the-scenes small sight of the Greage Fever
Scientists from European countries are forced to admit that today Aksu-Jabagyly is the birthplace of rubella, known to civilized countries around the world under the names "Greig jargon" and "Kaufman in a fever"
After all, the common people understand that this is the name of scientists who first discovered scientific research
Otherwise, as if Aksu called the fishermen Zhabagyla in Alatau, or as if he did not get into the treasury
Name! Greig was highly regarded in Holland in 1877 and awarded a special diploma
Since then, more than 200 species have been distributed in our fever
Botanist N. Aksu-Zhabagyly, known for his flora features
Karmysheva left a lot of work
He was a researcher and assistant (1939-1959)

The special plant of this region is especially studied
Arsha Aksu-Zhabagyly
According to a study by the scientist, at the junction of Alatau and Karatau there were six species of algae
Over the next three hundred years, its three species completely disappeared
To date, chernozem algae and weeds remain

At the same time, the Aksu-Zhabagylinsky reserve was created and served as the reason for achieving an excellent arsha to date [1
Currently, 30% of the reserve is occupied by spruce forests
Karmysheva wrote in her works: "The amazing Aryan fields made for centuries have been preserved throughout Kazakhstan only on the territory of Aksu-Dzhabagyla and in the tracts of Sairamsu and Saryaigyr."
Scientists say that only one hectare of barley emits 30 kg of phytoncides distributed by air per day
There are no microbes in the place where the phytoncide flow occurs
The common people know that in this phytoncide is the famous Borovsky region, which treats airways useful for the human body, as well as lung diseases
The difference is that phytoncide in Burabaya is spread from pine forests [4124 b
In the amazing mountains of Aksu-Zhabagyly, not excluding landslides, they retain this - arsha
Desirable moisture control - vodka
Also, the pride of the reserve is that the maralcona bear takes refuge in these spruce forests
Arsha boar forests are hogweed and fox.
Divers are also silent and stop at the bottom of vodka
High-rise arches and tautek tueski cross around the Christmas tree at a certain time
Scientists also expressed the opinion that beautiful vodka, such as the Big Aksu Small Aksu Zhabagyly Baldyberek and Balabaldyberek, contribute to the preservation of hundreds of lake lakes, such as thousands of stream streams and Ainakol Kyzulgenkol
The museum of the Aksu-Zhabagyly reserve stores a cut of vodka made about four hundred years [5 16-b
No less vodka that has committed six hundred and seven hundred years

It is surprising that arshyl fuses with a slope to the occipital bones of vodka
In the Aksu-Jabagyla region of Tien Shan, water lands spread the natural aspect-phytoncide for air purification in the villages and cities of Kyrgyzstan in nearby regions of Uzbekistan
According to scientists, this part of Western Tien Shan was the bottom of the sea 440-570 million years ago
Animal remains found in gray limestones
With subsequent flooding of the site of the drained reserve for the second time
350-400 million years ago, a favorable warm climate was established
230-280 million years ago, coniferous trees began to appear
Our ancestors left several notes and drawings in the historical stones of Aksu-Jabagyla
These inscriptions and signs and drawings have been surprising scientists, specialists, nature lovers in general for many years
Marals, among whom wild animals lived, as well as hunters with great skill are depicted in marals
Hundreds of inscriptions-drawings on malignant braided stones in cascabules are scattered with a high culture and taste height
Corals in them, tautecs and arcars, like people, are depicted courtesy
Unfortunately, these inscriptions and symbols have not been comprehensively systematically studied
There are no book albums that detail genuine and detailed pictures
It is briefly said that the secrets of Kaskabulak have not yet been revealed and not fully revealed [2 78-b
Aksu-Jabagyla has a special world, except for fever and algae
They are called Sievers apples in the scientific literature
But in fact - Axu apples
Aksu will witness Uzbek channels
Not Arnovskoe Gorge, probably right
The length of the Aksu gorge (canyon) reaches half a kilometer wide 500-600 meters deep 18 km
In some data, the American ranks second after the famous Colorado Gorge
Wild apples of axu are different
T orange red with white colors
The taste is also different
Locals do not have time to collect these apples, which themselves ripen
Because in every village house in the region large orchards grow
Kazakh birches are found on the Ogem River, as in Sairams and Kaskasu
Kazakh birch with an unshaven brownish tint, not white red birch
Also in the rivers grow yellow and red fruits of a dense shrub grove with wild cherries and apricot cabbage
Employees of the reserve conduct a census of animals 3 times a year in the spring in autumn and during the first snowfall
We are pleased that according to the results of these censuses there is an increase
You can get to the Maidantal, which is considered inaccessible in the reserve, only in the summer
Until now, the huntsmen who saw the arcars, which were not there, were especially pleased by the inhabitants of nature
And if you look into the world of endicus, then a famous scientist studied the fauna of birds
Bucket released the book "Birds of Talas Alatau"
This book describes about 240 birds living in this reserve
In the works of Sherhan Murtaza, starting with blondes and frogs, and ending with a tazkar and other birds, these mountains are a favorite place [370-b
Reserve staff who speak English correctly set up a journey along three trails along a special ecological ten routes for hiking or horse travel for travelers from abroad
Road transport routes are also provided
No matter how many people come on the tourist route, even if it was the only tourist, a tour instructor is ready for you
Foreign tourists are especially interested in Axu canyon
Mountain Aksu canals, preserved in their natural form, are often mentioned that butterflies and birds with larks and reddish flowers and other trees continue to wave their heads.
Why not be proud of this natural beauty of the world
Why environmental workers, together with employees of the tourism sector, are not interested in creating new environmental tourism projects in the region
Why not do such work as cognitive, leisure and recreational, standing in nature?
It is possible to develop environmentally conscious tourism, preserving the richness and beauty of such a nature, along with the aforementioned Aksu-Zhabagyly, in other regions of the country
Only the introduction of annexes to special laws will return to the proposal for financial sponsorship, as well as the fact that qualified specialists will work in the field of environmental tourism
If in Ulan-Ude there are many citizens of Kazakhstan belonging to nature, then the date when this proposal becomes a real matter is not far away

"Sorption of heavy metal ions of sulfocationite based on glycidimethacrylate copolymer"
Non-ferrous metallurgy and metalworking industries generate wastewater contaminated with heavy metal salts that are most damaging to the ecosystem under technological trends
One effective method of treating wastewater from poisonous metal ions is the ionizing method
The purpose of the work is to study the sorption of heavy metal cobalt (II) and lead (II) ions with copolymers of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) and new sulfocationite obtained from concentrated sulfuric acid
The creation of ion replacement processes of high-quality and high-performance can only be decided as a result of an in-depth study of the equilibrium and kinetic properties of ionites
Sorption of heavy metal ions under static conditions with typical solutions based on comparison of KU-2x8 Co2 + Pb2 + new sulfocationite with industrial sulfocationite was investigated
To study the sorption properties of the obtained cationite, the ability to produce sulfocationite of an industrial power plant crosslinked at the KU-2x8 level was studied.
Change of concentration and kinetics of pre-prepared model solutions of cobalt (II) and lead (II) based on GMA-TPGA copolymer and concentrated sulfuric acid depending on pH value is investigated.
Results of experimental works showed high sorption and kinetic capacity of KU-2x8 sulfocationite compared to GMA-TPGDA-H2SO4 of industrial cationite
In particular, the equilibrium unit to GMA-TPGDA-H2SO4 mg/g at 32 pH for cobalt ions of the sorption vessel (CE) of new 3830 sulfocationite ends at 2 hours.
At 29 pH for lead (II) ions, the concentration of sorption (CE) of 5180 mg/g is carried out in 1 hour
Thus, based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that this new sulfocationite (GMA-TPGDA-H2SO4) is a highly effective ionite for sorption of cobalt (II) and lead (II) ions.
It exhibits higher absorption properties than industrial cationite, and KU-2x8 hydrometallurgical plants can be introduced.
Reference words: copolymerization of sulphocationites of ionic sorbent metals
Keywords: synthesis of pheromones, environmental monitoring catalysts
The search for safe and animal-friendly vegetation with fewer chemical treatments to reduce pesticide pollution is one way to improve the environment at present.
The use of insect pheromones for this purpose is a selective method of combating pollution
Since the 1980s, research on pheromones has been intensively conducted around the world
They were known in 1986 in 1000 species of Tukticans (Arn et all
1986 Skirkevicius 1988); In 2005, more than 7,000 insects (El-Said 2003-2005) became known in tuccanates
The use of pheromones in ecology and agriculture on an environmental-biological and chemical-technological basis is presented in monographs (Shorey McKelvey eds)
The science of pheromones, studying the biochemical foundations of insect relationships, has appeared and developed since the late 1950s (Shumakov 1986)
To date, the biochemistry and molecular biology of insect pheromones is one of the main areas of chemical ecology (Pickett 1998; Van der Pers Minks 1998; Rojas Wyatt 1999; Valeur et al
Many reviews and monographs present the objectives and uses of pheromones (Roelofs ed
Hundreds of years ago, it became known that insects have a special smell that attracts species such as the opposite sex itself.
The experience of the famous French entomologist Henri Fabre (1823-1915) proved that male insect cheeses Saturnia fly to females from a distance of several kilometers
The receiving member of insect pheromones, called antennas, is in the head - without them the male is not able to find a female by smell
Initially, it was proposed to call the means of chemical communication "telergons," but in a scientific association
the term "pheromones" means a carrier of excitation translated from ancient Greek
Authors of the term P
By the definition of Lucher (1959), pheromones are substances synthesized in living organisms, released into the environment and causing a responsible reaction (characteristic of them) of these biological species
Since odor substances are synthesized in the body in small quantities, their chemical examination turned out to be very difficult
Bombicol, first subjected to chemical examination, is a silk spinning pheromone of the Bomb Seas
Hecker and D
As a result of the study of Strain's work, bombicol - 1012-trans cis-hexade- cadiene -1-ol (figure a-c) turned out to be over 20 years.
Currently, gas-liquid chromatography methods of mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy allow analyzing nanograms of one animal origin
In nature, chemical signaling is widespread, which occurs not only in animal insects, but also in water algae and low-frequency fungi
Pheromone communication research is one of the main areas of the new branch of science - chemical ecology
The main form of environmental chemists studying pheromones is insects
Preventing communication between females and males of pests and disrupting their reproduction is one of the promising methods of plant protection
Pheromone Research - Opens the Way to Insect Management [1-3]
Pheromones are divided into two main types: releases - sending any reaction actions and primaries - changing the physiological state of species and modifying its development
Re- lysers are highly accurate, distributed mainly through air, and primaries are substances distributed by contact
More studied releases than primaries are divided into several types
Attractants - causing substances (sexual pheromones and aggregation pheromones) repellents -
frightening arrestants - stabilizing stimulants - deterrents that cause activity (for example, signal pheromones)
- retarding reaction
Some stimulants (aphrodisi-oaths) are mating substances of sexual arousal
Pheromones, which track the accumulation of insects of aggregation pheromones, direct the movement of species, indicating the territory.
Pheromones - impurities of the main component with smaller applications (minor components) by low-quality mass
A single substance may have several different functions
For example, secreted from the uterine gland of bees in the oral cavity
"royal thing" (figure i)
This pheromone, as a release, together with men attracts working bees to motherhood
The chemical structure of pheromones is different compared to their functional types
The relievers are characterized by high flight speed and relative simplicity of synthesis in the body [4]
Drawing
Some insect pheromones: a-b - smoky silk spinner (complete and abbreviated structural formulas - short chemical formula); g- pathetic
ants of the Acanthomyops family (alarming pheromone) from a silky d- room fly; Bees of the Trigona family (tracer pheromone); birch puncture; shells (aggregation pheromone); the main component of the bee "in royal matter"
Carbon atoms in green with bluish-acidic yellow - double bonds with designated hydrogen atoms in red
Most pheromones identified to date, together with alcohols and their acetates, form aldehydes and ketones
(Figure)
Insects chemically structural and optical
isomerism phenomenon is widely used
To accurately recognize the signals of most natural odors, the proportions of individual isomers and the ratios of the main and minor components in the pheromone mixture are used
The table shows the names of chemicals and the frequency of visits in the sex attractions of butterflies Amphipyrinae and Hadeninae [5]
Chemicals containing sex attractants of butterflies Amphipyrinae and Hadeninae
Butterflies belong to the tops of the genus Ditrysia
The carbon gene chain in their molecule is not branched and has from 12 to 18 atoms
Dyspalur widespread or 78-cis-epoxy-2-methyloctadecane is a sexual attractant of the pathetic silkworm of the Porthetria dicpar family (Figure d)
Butenandt) the first species is the chemical structure of mulberry silkworm pheromones from the moment of detection to the present, the construction of several thousand insect pheromones has been determined
The properties of pheromones made it possible to become an important part of the plant protection system
Integrated plant protection provides specific data on insect populations
This information is taken when observing insects using a gate pheromones
Used to protect cost-effective plant species and studied by deeper pheromones: oriental worms (C)
molesta) worm black (C)
cotton butterfly (Heliothis armigera) cotton (Pectinofhora gossypiella) and t
There are 3 main areas of application of pheromones in plant protection: hunting male insects for monitoring purposes, mass capture of male insects in order to reduce the population and deception (disorientation) in order to disrupt the sexual communication of insects
Using a trap in early spring, a new insect habitat is identified and population dynamics are predicted, revealing the spread of infected insects in places of infection
Monitoring is used to determine the optimal time of application of plant defenses to predict the number and time of insects
Pheromone monitoring during damage to plants by several species of insects will create the most dangerous species in the economy and a strategy for protecting against it
Monitoring will find new species to study previously unknown aspects of insect biology
By the number of caught pests, it is impossible to predict the number of egg worms and the economic damage caused by them by females
It is necessary to take into account the influence of natural factors on the development of the population
For example, adverse natural conditions reduce the number of eggs and worms, and with high catching of males, plant damage is reduced
The use of synthetic sex pheromones for monitoring is widely used in developed European countries in the USA to protect grape cotton orchards in Japan
This will allow you to move from generalized processing to cellular processing and reduce costs by 2-3 times
In Russia, pheromone traps are used to determine quarantine objects
Plant protection stations use pheromone farm monitoring to determine the time of effective application of insecticides to predict evaporation of fruits by worms to determine the dynamics of butterfly reproduction in the summer season
Bulk fishing
Many examples of fruitful application of mass fishing
VNITIKIZR (N) research on the use of pheromone compositions for feed
Atanov (1993)
efficiency was 88-90%
Research work carried out in a separate kindergarten with 50 gates per hectare
There are several limitations and difficulties in applying the method of mass fishing
Novartis Crop Protection contains 016% apple feed pheromones and 6% permethrin or cypermethrin
This composition is transferred to the plant in the form of a solution or viscous paste with a drip
For each hectare with a drop of 009 mg of pheromones and 342 mg of insecticide, 1200-2000 drops are consumed, each season 2-3 treatments of males are carried out for 4-5 weeks.
In many countries, including Russia, the joint use of pheromones and chemosterilants or regulators of the development and growth of insects has not been implemented in practice, although fruitfully.
The mechanism of disorientation of male insects is still unclear
Disorientation - the result of adaptation of receptors at high concentrations of pheromones or conjugation of artificial force along a false trace into the boiling water of pheromones was not revealed
In order to achieve the disorientation effect, it is necessary to bring the concentration of pheromones in insect treatment sites for the entire flight period to a high level
Maintenance of constant concentration for a long period is provided by dispenser
For this, hollow fibers of the capillary type with a single head are used
Pheromones in them are contained by capillary forces and evaporate from the open side
The uniformity of evaporation is ensured by the internal area of ​ ​ the capillary
Effective use of the whole dispenser disorientation method requires a large dose of the agent, preferably 100 g or more.
Given that the components of pheromones are expensive substances, the disorientation method does not meet economic requirements
When using these types of dispensers, most pheromones are released into the air in the absence of insect activity
To reduce the cost of drugs, the use of pheromones with additives to disorientation is being studied
For example, a Japanese company has produced modified pheromone drugs in experimental volume
Its effectiveness is improved when a small amount of alcohol is added to acetate in a disorienting preparation with butterflies (Spodoptera exigua)
For the viability of the disorientation method, it is necessary to search for means and installations of a new prolonged emission of pheromones
For example, the use of a spray providing a 20-fold increase in the emission rate of pheromones was more fruitful than conventional dispensers.
Pheromone distribution was carried out with a propulsion system equipped with a timer
These pheromones can only be used with increased insect activity
Such 4-5 plants are used to cultivate 1 hectare of land
Such drugs in 2000-2002 in Italy were fought against apple feed and other leaves
The yield of pheromone in each season is equal to the level of standard insecticide protection technology - the result of disorientation 160- 220 g
The method called "Auto-confusion" is interesting in that it contains pheromone and electrostatic powder with adhering properties to the bodies of male insects
After he is recruited, the beast flies away and takes the pheromone with him
Pheromone on the body of a male animal leads to the adaptation of its receptors and disruption of the entire sensory system, which is why the male cannot find the female
Processed live males make a "fake pheromone trail" because they look like mobile pheromone dispensers
Normal males, trying to contact females, take on part of the pheromone composition, thereby dispersing pheromones
This composition received positive results in England, Canada, Spain, reducing the number of rice worms with apples (Chilo suppressalis)
Scientific institutions of the Russian Federation (VIZR VNIIKHSZR VNIIZR, etc.
) in Moldova (VNIIBMZR) in Uzbekistan (SANIIZR) in other foreign countries implemented the practical application of poultry farms for the protection of crops
This was due to the major practical work of VNIIBMZR (Chisinau) and VNIIIHSZR (Shchelkovo) at the University of Tartu, where dosage forms of apples intermortants and other winter wheat and cabbage feed were made
However, due to the weak theoretical basis of applied work, they turned out to be contradictory
Research works for silkworms of leaf throwers and other pests are not used to monitor and reduce the number of butterflies using pheromones
The creation of ways of practical application of Tuktican pheromones is of great importance:
on many crops (cotton vegetable fruits, t
) control of first-class leaf butterfly pests and other seals is carried out annually in large areas; b) reduce the volume of chemical plant protection preparations during the mass introduction of pheromone production, as a result of which material costs can be saved, as well as reduce pesticide pollution
In order to improve the use of pheromones as a means of monitoring harmful fruit crops in the world and their development of new formulations, more detailed identification of components of tukikanate pheromones and their analogues (Arn et al.
1997-2003; Lib-likas 2004) intensive research on synthesis is carried out
The class of chemical compounds to which most pheromones used in practice belong are unsaturated aliphate compounds - substances of low toxicity
Pheromones are not contained in plants and other natural objects due to high volatility
Therefore, it is impossible to determine the amount of residues in the fruits
Pheromones used in the United States and Western European countries less than 150 grams due to the low toxicity of pheromones and their minor use are not subject to registration
Pheromones used in traps for mass fishing and monitoring are not recorded
Records, taking into account the danger of insecticide in such a preparation, if the pheromone is used together with insecticides by the method of "coagulation and killing"
At this stage, in the All-Russian Center for Plant Quarantine (FSBI VNIIKR) since 2009, Doctor of Chemical Sciences Professor B.
Under the leadership of Kovalev, fruitful work is underway in the field of synthesis of natural biologically active compounds (insect pheromones)
Their laboratory and field testing, as well as the phytosanitary risk of quarantine pests of pheromone and flower traps in the territory of the Russian Federation, approved by the Rosselkhoznadzor, in the largest zones of 2011-2015.
production operation is carried out according to the inquiry program
In 2011, the Rosselkhoznadzor issued and used about 80 thousand traps for monitoring the quarantine phytosanitary condition on the territory of the Russian Federation, which is 27 times more than in 2010
As a result, 750 944 thousand hectares were identified from 11 types of harmful quarantine insects in the Russian Federation, including 648 new ones
Since 2010, according to the protocol of the bureau of the plant protection department of the Rosselkhoznadzor, the All-Russian Center for Plant Quarantine was transferred the case of the synthesis and use of pheromones of quarantine pests
Unfortunately, work in Kazakhstan in this direction stopped
Work on stereoselective hydrogen of acetylene derivatives, which at one time are intermediates in the synthesis of pheromones in the 1990s. "
Sokolsky Institute of Catalysis and Electrochemistry "intensive work was carried out [6-10]
The basis of synthesis of pheromones and other biologically active substances is stereotalgam water supply of acetylene compounds to the corresponding cissolefins
Acetylene derivatives for this: carbinols, aldehydes esters and t
it is applied
The synthesis of cis and trans-olefin compounds containing components of any pest pheromones is constantly carried out abroad.
Stereotypical hydrogenation of the three bound compounds in most cases is carried out in the USA, Japan and France
However, the yield of cis-ethylene derivatives is 972-98%.
And in the CIS countries, stereotalgam hydrogenation of acetylene products and the production of catalysts are not always systematically carried out
Despite this, the yield of the ci- isomer is 97-98%, and for the yield of cis-olefins 98%, methods of borohydridation and magnesium bromidation of alkali metals are used in laboratory practice
Multi-stage process, first - economically inefficient, second - labor intensive
Hardware is also required
Therefore, the production of stereotalgam catalyst systems that meet the requirements of the new time for the purpose of high stereospecific hydrogen of acetylene compounds, the yield of the synthesis of basic pheromones in cis-ethylene is 99-100%, is currently very important
Many scientific articles in this direction were published and received patents, but these works were not entered into production for various reasons
As mentioned above, there is a prospect of using pheromones to control pests in agriculture and preserve the environment, so we consider it necessary to resume work in this direction.

International conservation practices have strategies to protect protected biological objects in situ and ex situ
In-situ protection strategy addresses comprehensive issues of protection of biological objects in the life environment
Getting out of this - it is necessary to protect their growth environment to protect species
The protection strategy in ex-situ conditions is designed for various aspects of the protection of biological objects outside the growth environment - in cultural conditions [1]
Therefore, it is important to know the environment of plant growth
In this article, we should elaborate on the plant cover
Currently, there are 500 thousand plants of higher stages and about 15 million animals on earth [5]
And every species has an important place for the biosphere, and we have to keep it as a pupil of the eye

In 1908, as part of the Northern Tangirtau (Tien Shan) botany R.
Soil and botanical expeditions of the Ptashitsky resettlement department worked [9]
The calculations of these expeditions contain many materials related to the vegetation world and vegetation of individual areas
However, since they remain in the nature of diary entries, it is difficult to get an idea of ​ ​ the legality of the spread of vegetation cover in some area

At one time, coke products played a large role in providing the rubber industry
The next stage of the study of the plant world of the Rayymbek region is directly related to the publication of the 9-volume (1956-1966) work "Flora of Kazakhstan" [8]
In accordance with the zoning adopted in this work, the Ketpensky and Teriskeysky Alatau is distinguished as a separate district in the Republic
According to "Flora of Kazakhstan" [12] in this area grows 801 species of plants of the highest stage
This list will be subsequently changed to V

One can note Saparbayeva's dissertation work [4]
According to Saparbayeva [4], the species composition of the Rayymbek district is about 1,500 plants
The diversity of the soil cover of the climate of the relief of the Rayymbek region affects the diversity of the vegetation coatings that form in it.

It presents the meadow-steppe forest-steppe belt (subalpine alpine meadows) and species of belt plants
Desert belt plants are found only in the form of fragments on the Golgash plain: Korolkova pair (Allium korlkowii Regel)
Tanirtau (Tian Shan) (Artemisia tianshanica Krasch
) (Caragana leucophloea Pojark
) и (Anabasis L
In the Rayymbek region, steppe vegetation is the dominant species
The vegetation cover of the field belt is distinguished by the presence in it of common field xerophytic raw legumes and mesoxerophytic mixed shrubs and field xeromesophytic plants
Meadow-steppe strip - solar and sunlight rays in the Rayymbek district are found only on the slopes
Spruce forests
Spruce forests are common in the Rayymbek district
The eastern part and northern slopes of the Rayymbek district are almost entire spruce forests, as well as spruce forests are often found in the form of bays
The subalpine belt extends in fields from the lower border of the alpine strip to the upper border of the spruce forest
The most common legumes in subalpine meadows: spark spark (Trisetum spicatum (L)
) red surface (Festuca rubra L
) bells (Poa pratensis L

Description of the natural conditions of the Rayymbek region as a prerequisite for the protection of plant species listed in the Red Book
Sedimentary Alapmunai associated gases Kyzylorda region South Turgai massif Aral Bay oil pipeline "KazTransOil" Atasu-Alashankou will be ecologically affected by economic development
The Republic of Kazakhstan occupies 35% of all oil reserves in the world according to the explored oil reserves
That is, today Kazakhstan ranks 9th in the world in confirmed oil reserves
According to the results of geological research, it was established that in almost all regions of the land of Kazakhstan there are oil and gas deposits (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Map of the location of the sedimentary massifs of Kazakhstan [1]
It follows from this map that 15 sediments live in Kazakhstan: Caspian Northern Ustirt Bosashi South Mangistau Island North Turgai South Turgai Teniz North Kazakhstan Syr Darya Shu Sarysu near Balkhash Zaysan Alakol Western OR Eastern Iliysky massif
Of the indicated sedimentary massifs in 5 massifs, in particular on the Caspian North-Ustyurt lakes of the Southern Mangistau South Turgai Shu Sarysu, industrial oil and gas content was revealed
No full studies of oil and gas were carried out in the remaining massifs
Therefore, currently oil and gas are produced only from West Kazakhstan Kyzylorda region (Aktobe Atyrau West Kazakhstan Kyzylorda and Mangistau regions)
From the chart below you can see the shares of explored oil and gas reserves in the regions of oil and gas production (Figure 2)
So far, only Amangeldinskoye gas field has begun to be developed from the South Kazakhstan region
Figure 2
Share of oil reserves by region
Share of Kazakhstan's oil reserves in the world is 35%, gas ore - 13%
During the years of independence of the country, oil production increased 3 times - more than 5 times
Gas ores are also well developed in the 5 above areas (Figure 3)
Figure 3
Share of gas reserves by area
Oil and gas fields of Kyzylorda region are part of sedimentary massifs of South Turgay of the Aral Sea and Syr Darya among the above sedimentary basins [2]
The South Turgai massif is an integral part of the Turan board, which forms the southeastern part of the Turgai district
This is the first discovered deposit in the sedimentary region of Kumkol (1984
Subsequent discovered deposits: Aryskum (1985
) Kyzylkia (1986
) Akshabulak and Nuraly (1987
) Aksai (1988
) Settlement (1990
Currently, 17 oil and gas fields have been discovered on the territory of the massif, including Arys and
Deposits of the Southern Settlement are gas condensate, the rest - oil and gas condensate
Both fields belong to large reserves Kumkol and Akshabulak
In the north and northeast of the Aral sedimentary massif, bounded by the Irgiz volost and the Central Ustirt dislocation system south of the Lower Syr Darya, the Aral Kyzylkum rebellion system plays the role of the extreme element of the massif in the west
The basin area is about 80 km2.
Upper Paleozoic formations are considered the crystalline foundation
Syrdarya sedimentary massif
In the northeast and southwest, the Middle and South Tian are associated with the eponymous ridge bounded by the Shan Mountains
Basin area 150 thousand km2
According to some researchers, the crystalline foundation consists of boards and Paleozoic complexes of gneiss and granite
Kumkol oil field is located 160 km north of the regional center
Oil field with a total area of ​ ​ 23143 hectares, discovered in February 1984
Due to the geographical location of the field south of the Turan Plain, the Kumkol field after the discovery became the third oil and gas province in the country "Turan"
The total explored oil reserve at the field is 280 million tons, and suitable for development - 130 million tons
Oil is produced from a depth of 09-14 km
Together with the total oil, gas will be extracted from the Kumkol field
Total gas reserves 15 bcm
Oil Kumkol will produce two oil companies

Associated gases of oil deposits heavy 494-6383% methane
302-45% heavy hydrocarbons have 2-35% nitrogen and a small amount of carbon dioxide helium
In 1990, in connection with the beginning of the development of the Kumkol field, the Kumkol-Karakoyyn oil pipeline was built, designed to transport Kumkol oil to the Pavlodar-Shymkent oil pipeline
The first point of this two-part oil pipeline with a diameter of 530 mm is designed to bring Siberian oil to Kumkol and mix it here with Kumkol oil, and the second point with a diameter of 720 mm to bring the resulting mixture to Karakoyan
Mixing of Siberian oil and Kumkol oil is carried out in the form of a ratio of 30% to 70% in order to reduce the rate of thickening of the mixture
With a pipeline productivity of 720 mm diameter of 8 million tons of oil per year, this indicator of the pipeline with a diameter of 530 mm is 6 million tons per year
KazTransOil JSC and China National Oil and Gas Exploration Corporation set up Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP for construction of oil pipeline
Length of Atasu-Alashankou oil pipeline 962 km
Pipe diameter - 813 mm
Oil pipeline passes through the territory of three regions: Karaganda East Kazakhstan and Almaty
And goes to the last puk of Alashankaya in China
Financing of the project was carried out by providing a loan under the guarantees of the Chinese side
Buyyrtsa by 2020 through this pipeline 20 million per year

The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline project with a capacity of 10 million tons per year is the 2nd stage of the Kazakhstan-China project and is the National Oil and Gas Corporation of China and
According to the agreement between the joint-stock company "National company" KazMunaiGas "dated December 20, 2006 will be implemented by the Chinese by the KKP LLP
Kenkiyak-Kumkol oil pipeline will pass through the territory of Aktobe Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan with a total length of 794 km with a diameter of 813 mm
The primary capacity of the pipeline is 10 million per year
is 20 million tons per year
considered increase to tons
Financing of the project was carried out by providing a loan under the guarantees of the Chinese side
In October 2009, the launch complex was put into operation, in December 2010, the project for the primary construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol oil pipeline was fully completed [6]
With the commissioning of the Atasu-Alashankou main oil pipeline in Karaganda and Almaty regions, 296 Kenkiyak-Kumkol main oil pipelines in Kyzylorda region were put into operation, thanks to the modernization of the main oil pumping station Kumkol, more than two hundred jobs were created
According to the results of 8 months of 2013 year, oil operators of Kyzylorda region produced 69144 thousand tons of oil, which is 952% to the same period of 2012 year
In 2012, more than 107988 thousand tons of oil were produced with oil operators of the region, which is 987% compared to 2011
The decrease in oil production is observed in Torgai Petroleum JSC Torgai Petroleum JSC, Oil Company JSC and CNPC Ai Dan-Neft JSC due to the high level of well irrigation and
Related to the transfer of Kumkol and South Kumkol fields to the final stage of production
At the same time, the decrease in oil production volumes is due to the long-term preparation of documents for the long-term execution of design documentation and the procedure for obtaining permission for gas combustion during the transition to trial operation of fields or stages of industrial development of fields.
In order to improve the economy and social sphere of Kyzylorda region for 2012, memorandums of cooperation were signed with 12 oil companies of the region, amounting to 1144 7098 (one billion one hundred forty four million seven hundred nine thousand eight hundred) tenge in equivalent

Gas turbine plant at Kumkol field of PetroKazakhstan Kumkol Resources JSC
The gas processing plant of the joint-stock company TorgayPetroleum began work at the Kenlik field for the production of gas gasoline using associated gas
Oil and gas industry causes irreparable damage to the environment, influencing the development of the region's economy
In particular, soil air leads to chemical contamination of water
In the region, the production of oil and associated gas of the industry for the production of food products for sewing and textile paper and building materials is developed
Development of mineral resource raw materials for industrial development of the region
Therefore, the main industries are the extraction of non-ferrous metallic uranium oil and gas
But one source of pollution remains oil and gas production and processing (Table 1)
Main enterprises producing pollutants in Kyzylorda region
In general, oil and gas fields of Kyzylorda region have a special place in the economy of the region
But this combustible raw material is not so far away
Studies have shown that oil and gas reserves in the region will be enough only for the next 15 years
So we should consider other sources of economic growth

Healthy ecology with educational form and life skills of young people.
One of the long-term priorities in the program "Қazaқstan-2050" of the strategic direction of development of our state is "Health of citizens of Kazakhstan in the field of education and health"
shows the need to develop our citizens for a healthy lifestyle so that our citizens are healthy for the rest of their lives and that the environment is clean
This issue is especially reflected in the Government's programs in the Plan of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2015 and in the program "Salamatti Қazaқstan" [1]
Who guarantees the existence of earthly life in the future due to the fact that today humanity does not know what earth's health and human health are?
The purpose of this small article is to explain to the future generation the situation that has developed today, to educate the nature and healthy existence of their heads
Teaching to the younger generation of the principle of maintaining health in their hands
Do not forget that the task of parents in the family, not to mention school
Because to avoid natural disasters, we need to know that a healthy life begins with a family
For this, the literacy of parents in a healthy lifestyle plays an important role
Let's not forget that the apple is not far from the tree
In order to ensure a full blood education of young students for a healthy lifestyle, the teacher himself must have high personal qualities of educational symbols of a healthy lifestyle
This is the attitude of the teacher's face to the student as a subject of the educational process
In this case, the student feels like a person doing voluntary work, he feels that he considers himself a person who believes in his opinion.
Abdizhapparova R.
Aitbakina in the work "Issues of educational work at school": "Holding a conversation about a book of joint reading of works with a small amount of extracurricular educational work is necessary in a creative direction taking into account the age specifics of students" [23]
The environment of children from the day the younger generation turned to the threshold of school
education with parents in the protection of the environment and nature is the responsibility of the teacher
It is worth noting here that the Kazakh people from the very beginning raised their descendants without any scientific evidence of nature conservation
For example, not to kill an innocent living living, not to contaminate water that does not thirst for a plant, "she explains that you live like you.
Environmental control of one of the environmental industries
Not only the production of technology for conflict with nature, but also the lack of incompetence in the proper management of people's actions
The principle that our ancestors living in exile daily take out of life in order to preserve their health is that human health can only be in earthly health.
No matter how absent the science of the Kazakh people (in the comments of today's scientists), no matter how migration lives, do not pollute yourself with the environment, that is, do not kill the innocent living owner of the plant - in the matter of nature protection
fell asleep with great foresight
After all, in educating future generations, we did not nurture contempt for the environment, explaining this by the sin of religion
In contrast, today the Kazakh people have a lot of unwritten law on everyday life not on the principle of science, which has reached the peak of its development
After all, if today's development of technological progress leads humanity to the destruction of the Earth, then the Kazakhs from the very beginning explained this as a personal crime
In the Semipalatinsk region, we are talking about the fact that one tenth of the newborn is not healthy.
That these facts lie in a depth that we do not yet know
The conclusion from this is that scientists who disassemble an atomic bomb are not aware of their crimes aimed at destroying humanity
One of the authors who once detonated an atomic bomb, Academician A.
Sakharov for the first time refused to recognize his idea
Too bad it was late
Today, the current ecological situation on the land of Kazakhstan, if no measures are taken to preserve nature, it is difficult to believe that in the future humanity will live a living body
This can prove our opinion, but not above the above examples
The protection of mother and child health should be under the direct attention of the public health authorities of our state
An environmentally bad situation causes 20% of deaths, and in some regions the situation is even more difficult
1/3 of our compatriots use poor-quality water
Malnutrition and malnutrition have negative demographic consequences
Therefore, everyone should pay special attention to nutrition and drinking water
The mother must be healthy so that the child has good health
The stronger the health of a child born to small-blooded mothers, and not from the degradation of nature with an increase in blood incidence among mothers
The future of our country is a young generation, but on this day their health is small
Do not public Kurds such as prostitution and drug addiction, which has recently begun to gain momentum, contribute to it?
Because of this, many dementia children are born
If a newborn is a ceiling, then how many have fallen out
The State should take care of the health of the mother and the child in general
15% of those born were sick
The number of children born with disabilities is particularly high
Every year, 3,500 children are born with heart defects
Incidence of diseases such as yellow tuberculosis is decreasing year after year
TB patients increased by 13%
This year alone, 700 children fell ill with tuberculosis
If we analyze the causes of the infant's death, then in the first place are those who died in the perinatal period, in the second third place are those who suffer from inflammation of the respiratory tract and intestinal infection in 1993, President of Kazakhstan N.
Nazarbayev signed the United Nations Conference on the Rights of Children
This ensured the good health and development of every child at the conference
President of Kazakhstan in 2030 paid special attention to issues of public health, including motherhood and childhood
Mothers and children have a lot of diseases that occur in double women
In front of mother's milk
poisonous nitrate not encountered with us
Opening the light, the baby fed her mother's liver
Premature baby loses immunity to various diseases
If you survive the trouble, at the end of this generation there will be a weak child who will not withstand the hot cold
Isn't that a problem for a small population? About twenty thousand people get sick every year
This is the ecological blockade of our environment
Missing land with vegetation dilapidated luxury
This catastrophe before us affects the behavior of people with a smile
Another ecological region of Kazakhstan will include Baikonur
Because Baikonur, going into space, connects millions of radioactive rays
Radioactive rays attached to the iron affect water on the ground in the air
These rays affect not only superiors, but also humans
Harmful diseases spread from radioactive rays to humans: cancer - tuberculosis
In practice, science has proved that the current environmental situation in the country is due to a variety of ecological potologies
The biological impact of environmental pollutants is due to the fact that their poisoning of humans causes malignant neoplasms and depends on mutagenic properties.
It has been proven that very common poisonous substances are very harmful to human health, especially in nature with a low content of MPC, that is, with a low sufficient concentration in the environment.
After all, all these stealthy substances that pollute the environment, when combined, increase their value
Of the environmental factors affecting the living organism, cytostatics that inhibit the formation of chemical and biological protein, alkylating compounds of purine peroxide and pyrimines, base derivatives of pesticides and herbicides used in agriculture, defoliant agents and mineral fertilizers.
Under the influence of the above compounds, the structure and activity of the cell is disrupted
As a result, potological processes arise, characterized by loss and distortion of cell activity
Cell damage is directly related to damage to its membranes
One of the functions of the membrane is to provide immunity to morbidity, removal and neutralization of foreign substances and their poisonous products
The cause of damage to this biological membrane is some preparations of organic and inorganic poisonous substances, as a result of which the body's ability to withstand chromosomal allergy diseases is deteriorated, exchanges of protein hydrocarbon water and electrolytes are reduced
In addition, the frequent penetration of foreign chemicals into the body leads to a violation of the acid basic balance in the body
According to scientists, the state of health of people by 50-52% of the lifestyle depends on 20-25% of inheritance factors 18-20% of the environment 7-12% of the level 5 of maternal health care
Anthropogenic factors create new man-made diseases that were previously absent
Among the factors that have harmful effects on human health, various pollutants take the first place
As a result of human actions, more than 4 million non-characteristic substances have been released into the biosphere
In addition, thousands of new substances are released into the environment annually
Most of them are xenobiotics, that is, foreign substances for humans and living organisms
The increase in incidence is also due to the fact that the natural environment with various transformations and its complete destruction turns into industrial complexes into the same type of dwellings and so on into a third nature
The impact of social and economic conditions on health is increasing
Unfavourable social economic conditions, even if the physical and chemical environment is pure, show that the disease is fatal
The deterioration of the socio-economic situation affects the psychological state of a person through stressful phenomena
According to the World Health Organization, about 500,000 people are poisoned by pesticides every year in the world, of which 5,000 are fatal
According to scientists, 90% of all malignancies due to adverse environmental effects in Germany for 10 years, the proportion of cancer patients increased from 15 to 23% in men to 17-25% in women
Diseases are common in industrial and contaminated areas
All harmful phenomena occurring in nature are artificial human suffering
Consciously and unconsciously occurs due to a lack of basic knowledge of nature protection by people created for nature
Where in most countries environmental education began earlier than in our country
For example, in Japan in the 60s of the XX century
It was at this time that a surge of anthropogenic negative factors occurred
The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known as Minamata, which occurred in the 50s of the last century, demanded strengthening environmental education in Japan
Now let's try to look at the scientific basis of how environmental disorder activates, and then we'll know what we're doing.
In order for living life not to disappear from the Earth, first of all, it must have the goal facing humanity - the assimilation of the legality of the natural phenomenon
Man notices that he needs to master phenomena in celestial (atmospheric) space
The fact is that not scientific reference is even a religious concept and an explanation of the fact that the physical structure of a person who loves legends consists of water and air - primarily from soils, in how much air affects the human body.
Readers already in the XVIII century discovered that as a result of such control, that is, in celestial space, there are ions with different charges, currents are formed from the interaction of these ions during movement
One of the first to prove such ideas was the French scientist I.
Bertlan (1780s) for the first time proved that the airways of life are subject to diseases, provoking the internal organs of the body, conducting an electric current of airspace
Of course, compared to the achievement of science today, this can be called the era of the first event of science
The scientific direction of such a rule is associated with the phenomenon of space biology today, said Russian scientist S.
In 1938, for the first time on a scientific basis, Chizhevsky gave a certificate on the incidence of life organs when sunlight approaches the Earth's surface due to its highly active effect
Therefore, during such a period, infectious diseases spread between the living, since not all organisms are exposed to the disease at a certain time from sunlight
Because each body takes sunlight in a variety of conditions, since sunlight has a gradual effect on the body, and an organism suffering from the disease necessarily infects a healthy living.
Hygiene (the relationship of the body with the environment), which developed these rules, is one of the founders of science I.
Skvortsov developed a scientific concept, studying how useful is the effect of negative charge ions in airspace on the body
According to him, negative ions in the air play a large role in maintaining the internal-external balance of the body
If negative electricity ions in the airspace decrease in the environment where the body is located, then a physiologically unfavorable situation arises for the body
In hygienic terms, the main explanation should not be the physical or chemical composition of the atmosphere, but the electric charges in it.
That is, it has been proved that today the electrical conductivity of the environment, that is, air, depends on the movement of its positive and negative charges [4]
Constant charges in the air today will be called "aeroions"
Thus, aeroions in the air are useful to the human body at a stable level in a certain amount
If the level of ions does not increase or decrease, then the health of life immediately undergoes changes.
Of course, today's environmental disruption in Kazakhstan is not limited only to the influence of a phenomenon in celestial space
Since humanity became human, direct communication with nature has taken away its needs from this natural phenomenon and flourished on the basis of this
Realizing this, mankind has come to the point of harming wildlife, moving from there and settling elsewhere.
What does it mean
Man himself recognized himself as a member of this nature
So he explained the harm to nature by what he did to him
Nevertheless, humanity is developing
Technological progress is progressing very rapidly
A person had to live in big cities
In this regard, humanity has lost the opportunity to live together with everyday nature and is now deliberately starting to destroy the phenomenon of nature
He himself began to abuse his health
Thus, the enhancement of high-speed sound movement in the life of the city when mixing especially harmful chemical impurities in the airspace with an increase in the level of carbon in the air of various rays, the treatment of arable land with chemical impurities, water pollution in places of rest
replenishing the biological composition of food with harmful additives
All phenomena should have the basic principles of the conscious elimination of human health - an increase in toxic and harmful substances that destroy human health, that is, reduce life
World-famous Russian artist Sergei Obraztsov, who became a healer of the child's soul, never left the theater and did not return home, stumbling upon a group of children running on the way to the pigeon
Looking back, the artist says that the soul of the children took off and landed, and the legs rolled off the roof
Then they say that they made a pigeon - cut off the leg
Then C
Specimens says it's a bird if you stand and say what you're going to do
The devastated artist said that no one will come out of them except the evil wolf.
The conclusion from this is that we have not been able to popularize in our generation except cruelty and mercy, and today we have not reached the state in which people, preserving nature, eat each other alive.
Article 4 of the State Programme for Public Health, adopted in October 1998
"prevention of diseases is the reduction of healthy eating objects that are harmful to the environment and compliance with health measures with physical education and alcohol consumption, etc.
"[5]
The conclusion is that the main goal of the entire society that has survived humanity was to grow a healthy generation that will further develop this society.
Is it possible to believe here that, based on the historical principle, a healthy generation of Kazakhs will grow in the future?
Then our health will be only in connection with the natural phenomenon, that is, with the environment
Therefore, if we talk about longevity, we need to keep the ground as if the child is freezing
Let us summarize that if every erroneous step is left to us, it will jeopardize our future
Let's find a way that will not be sick until we get treatment!!!

Environmental Market Management Environmentally Friendly Production Process Greening Market Greening Production Ecology- Economic Relations Green Business Plan
To maximize human survival in the natural equilibrium in the environment that has undergone deformation due to the pace of economic development, an important approach to the relationship between modern man - nature
In this regard, in the implementation of efficient environmental management, it is important to develop environmental management in the country
But the supervisory authorities in the environmental safety management system do not have time to ensure the safety of the environmental development of all industries
While environmental audits of these services are provided to private firms that can create competition in the area of advisory training and engineering services, the main issues related to sustainable development are addressed at the level of production and teams
And they often do not have specialists at the level of existing requirements for greening in the production management system
In this direction, there is a need to contact an environmental manager or a consulting manager who can answer environmental questions
Learn more about the term environmental manager or environmental manager
The term is used by authors in various ways, for example, economic management in a system of greening production or conscious management in order to achieve sustainable development
That is, maintaining a balance between economic growth in production and environmental quality and natural resource recovery
Therefore, in the term environmental manager, priority is given to an environmentally trained management specialist, and in the ecologist-manager - to an ecologist with the necessary managerial skills
Consultant Manager Role of a specialist in this environmental management system who can respond to environmental issues in the Ministries of Greening Large Industries [1]
Due to the fundamental natural resources of the economy of Kazakhstan, environmental specialists dealing with these issues need to train modern managers and strive to further expand their sphere of activity
Therefore, for the training of specialists in the era of globalization, first of all, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the goals of environmental management
The term management (from English management - management organization) - production management; combining methods and forms of production management principles [2]
The main key to the performance of any business in a market environment is management - that is, a proper management approach that requires the ability to regulate priority values ​ ​ and such constraints in the direction of the goal.
In connection with the simultaneous field of activity and education, management occupies a strong place in science and culture in modern economic management
Theories and practice of modern managerial understanding are characterized by 3 new trends:
Pay more attention to simple reality and correct thinking
In this regard, professional managers involved in the management sphere will implement daily strong motivation of ordinary managers and performers
Discard the habit of feeling like an observer in the outside light
Internationalization of management is manifested in practical application as a result of collective thinking of globalization of the world economy [3]
Environmental management - a special management system based on a regulatory system aimed at preserving the quality of the environment with social environmental and economic regulatory parameters
Environmental management - a management that provides for the timely formation of an environmentally safe production and territorial complex and ensures the optimal ratio between environmental and economic indicators of the products of this complex [1]
Objective: To be considered as an object of environmental management in order to achieve what is desired on a scientific basis and practice
Basic principles: justification of economic motivation; timely solution of environmental problems; Be responsible for an environmental accident resulting from a decision taken at any level of management; the importance (priority) of addressing environmental problems
Main tasks: implementation of environmentally sound production processes; ensuring environmental compliance of the company's entire production; achieving optimal environmental-economic relations (achieving maximum achievements with minimum environmental damage); Monitoring of harmful anthropogenic effects in production; use or destruction of products produced; in front of society
the formation of a green image; Any control system consists of stages regulated by a certain system for the realization of the set goals;
There are no stages in eco-management that must be met, but the practice of achieving the goal shows that this will save time on the necessary substances of resources
In the construction of a new production or reconstruction and modernization of the old, there should be the following positions (responsible environmental manager)
Preliminary coordination of actions;
Ensuring that future production meets the requirements of the international environmental standard;
Compliance with the internal state standard;
Strengthening environmental requirements [2]
Environmental management in military production complexes is of particular importance in the development of biotic resources in petrochemical chemical complexes in agricultural mining and production complexes
Including we will focus on the system of environmental management in production
Eco-management in production - making effective other decisions to improve the environmental performance of production
Any production is required to develop a Green business plan to protect itself from harmful environmental impacts and results
Green Business Plan - a transformation of the views of production managers to show the opportunities that open up to its strong weaknesses in a green production environment
The basis of the business plan guide depends on the nature of the production activities and the environmental impact [3]
The task of the environmental manager is to show in practice the compliance of production with the environmental requirements of its activities
Therefore, the Zhasyl business plan will have the form of an environmental analysis of production, in which strengths of weaknesses can pose economic risks when environmental requirements are strengthened
Environmentally priority production parties
environmentally friendly products;
resource-saving technologies that do not harm the environment
the image of green production;
support for workers in the workplace
a good vision of social environmental movements and foundations;
possibility of obtaining additional and preferential investments;
strengthening research to produce environmentally sound products;
green ads, etc.
Environmental weaknesses of production
Products shall not be disposed of (not destroyed);
Packagings of packaging materials shall not be destroyed naturally (under residual conditions);
"dirty" production;
hazardous production wastes;
availability of production as a source of environmental pollution;
neglect of managers of production workers in environmental protection;
loss of the market for the use of finished products;
high costs associated with increasing environmental standard requirements [4]
In conclusion, the current development policy of the country raises the need for specialist managers in all sectors of the economy
Therefore, the use of nature, its resources, their rise to the world level, security in a word, greening is undoubtedly one of the main tasks
Multimedia CD internet illustration innovation computer model of interactive media communication programs
The Address of the Head of State "New Kazakhstan in the New World" states: "We must achieve the provision of high-quality educational services at the level of world standards throughout the country," as well as that "At present, young people very much need an interested new education related to information technologies, in accordance with world standards."
Changes in the country have led to dramatic changes in the training of the chemical industry, which requires the creation of a modern program for training in chemical education using informatization tools
Information and communication technologies are very useful for creating pedagogical psychological conditions that will allow the future generation to receive comprehensive education and freely develop business and talented creativity
Informatization of educational activities in Kazakhstan will improve the quality of education and ensure the level of methodological growth of students
In secondary specialized educational institutions, we have the opportunity to improve the quality of professional training of future teachers and to intensify the educational and educational process through informatization
Because the 21st century is the age of information, humanity needs computer literacy
Today, the main place is occupied by solving scientific problems in studying the results of teaching a chemical specialty using computer interactive tools
The reason is that the new pedagogic and psychological problems of computers arising in the process of learning have not yet been completely solved
The use of interactive tools in natural science education has a great impact on students in mastering knowledge
Improvement in the training of future chemistry teachers based on new pedagogical technologies will be implemented by designing the educational process
A unique algorithm for designing the educational process for the chemical industry, providing vocational and pedagogical training for future teachers, provides for the creation of new technologies for teaching the new content of educational disciplines with the creation of a new educational goal
New pedagogical technologies - the formation of the professional orientation of future teachers should be considered as an integral part of the characteristic of a specialist with the qualified teacher
Modeling of personal-oriented education of students from a methodological point of view reflects three functions of the education system:
elimination of deficiencies in a person's basic education;
adaptation, that is, providing the most relevant and functional educational requirements;
development, promoting the growth of the individual from creativity and meeting his various spiritual needs
The three components of the model mutually influence each other and complement each other
The main goal of the media space of chemistry is that students independently receive more information
self-study videos are based on the compactness of creative development of their understanding through video films
Students will receive educational materials through new information technologies - Internet and multimedia - special CDs
The use of a computer in its activities of any student, as proved in experience, is measured by the fact that when they enter the world information space, an information culture is formed
At the same time, the use of innovative methods and tools in the process of mastering chemical specialties increases the interest of students in the wide development of the chemical industry
Information and communication technologies make it possible to master chemistry widely
One of the main industries inside the media space is the media space through Internet networks and special CDs
Duties of students on methods and methods of studying chemistry through computer-based Internet networks and special CDs:
computer knowledge;
the ability to work with computer-based Internet networks and special CDs;
primary chemical formation
obtaining the necessary information for the project;
send the necessary information
Media Space for Internet Chemistry and Special CDs
The availability of information needed from chemistry by one edge, only if this information is detected correctly and quickly
Secondly, receiving this information via the Internet
The media program of chemistry with the Internet and CD performs the following functions: (on the plan to gain knowledge about the interest in the knowledge gained), quickly obtaining information about the connection of chemistry with other objects in an arbitrary independent education can distinguish between the needs and quality of information and be able to analyze information reflecting the development of visual memory abilities through the screen
The second function is the ability to use technology in media space, process information and information in the search for scientific data through new technologies
Internet networks receive additional chemistry education through special CDs and develop a culture of media education
General education in chemistry promotes awareness of scientific papers
The computer can be used by the student as a visual tool for obtaining information from various reference data.
Such data include chemical types of physical formulas, units of measurement of physical quantities, tables of illustrations, dynamic image of chemical phenomena, List of devices for experiments with the characteristics of instruments, etc.
can be attributed to
The introduction of electronic technology in the accumulation of necessary information will increase the completeness of information in the period under review and create skills in working with electronic devices as part of the information and reference system
Multimedia is a hardware and hardware program that allows users to work with graphics online
Multimedia 4 associates different data with one channel:
Text;
Images;
Moving images;
Sound melody
The method of the media space of chemistry is one of the areas of modern need and develops the culture of students working with a computer
When teaching students, computer is the main tool for the development of education related to the development of new technologies than with foreign research:
individual training depending on the speed of topic ownership;
relationship with past themes;
verification of knowledge and erroneous work;
Perform exercises
wide variety of visibility;
chemical experiments and computer-assisted experiments;
development of educational culture;
conscious planning of their actions;
the ability to create models of phenomena;
improving the search level;
system-creative level is formed
Its capabilities are especially great if you imagine the implementation of a reflexive level from a computer in educational activities
A computer can display the strengths and weaknesses of any thought
With your PC, you can quickly multitask reports that are difficult to release
Therefore, developing our knowledge, we get the result of a report calculated with very high accuracy
Formation of new conditions not only in the audit system, but also in the development of the topic
For example, creating the simplest programs for chemical calculations of graphs from independent chemistry, creating posters, working with a partnership, computer design of chemical industries
Each person works individually through a computer
The activation of the educational process consists in the effective organization of labor on the mastery of the theoretical content of educational material and the formation of their practical skills and skills
The effectiveness and quality of the computer-based learning process depends on the teacher's methodological training and the teaching techniques and methods
Teaching new technologies requires a huge business and creative search from the teacher
Learning Challenges Become New in New Technologies
They:
knowledge of topical issues of pedagogical activity;
development of modified curriculum guidelines;
assembly of the training module;
determining the content of educational projects, compiling tasks for each student;
Create a system of horizontal exercises for their assimilation of new material
Identification of indicators for the orientation of training activities;
developing skills to create missing didactic tools
Media business secures personal information
If a student learns to search for oriented information, he does not have time in front of the computer
Media efficiency ensures the security of personal information
Computer ownership of chemistry, that is, conducting laboratory chemical calculations and experimental work - a promising technical tool that most actively affects the effectiveness of the chemistry development process

Environmental aspects environmental education ecological culture students organic chemistry courses Laboratory work on chemical concepts of hydrocarbons environmental education
Environmental problems in the modern world are one of the most important problems of mankind
Production of ferrous and non-ferrous metal fertilizers The emergence of production complexes of a large-scale region for the production of minerals, the production of natural resources and their economic use, etc.
pollution has led to an environmental crisis
So the pollution of the biosphere led to an increase in the incidence of people and a decrease in the immune status of youth
The need to address the environmental crisis requires clear environmental policies
The purpose of this policy is to improve and protect the environment, effectively break-even use of natural resources
Environmental knowledge and education must be placed at the right level to implement environmental policies
To this end, in the training of future specialists in universities and colleges, educational work should be directly related to the formation of environmental culture of students
To properly assess environmental degradation and contamination and identify ways to eliminate it, it is necessary to understand the basics of chemical processes
Therefore, environmental aspects of chemistry education in educational institutions, including organic chemistry, occupy an important place
The formation of environmental knowledge and education of students in the training of organic chemistry courses will allow young people in the future to integrate into the ecological cleanliness of the country, developing an attitude towards the environment and ecological culture
Very early, the child could get some organic substances and use them for his household needs
For example, wine drinks were prepared by fermenting sugar
Plant-based dyes - indigo alizarin and t, which received sugar from sugar cane in India
used in everyday life
At the same time, essential oils with a pleasant smell - vinegar and t
organic matter [1]
At the end of the XIX century at the beginning of the XX century, the development of organic chemistry led to the emergence of new industries
For example, pharmaceutical industry fuel industry artificial fibrous plastic artificial rubber industries and t
Currently, the number of these industrial enterprises has increased and powerful new industrial enterprises of organic chemistry are being built
This phenomenon, on the one hand, occupies an important place in strengthening the national economy and improving the living conditions of mankind, on the other hand, it makes a significant contribution to the destruction and pollution of the environment
adds
That is, one of the problems facing the world community is the deterioration of humanity's habitat under the influence of chemistry
The only way to solve this is to form a person with environmental knowledge
Therefore, all chemical knowledge obtained over the centuries is subject to only one main goal of chemistry - the task of obtaining substances with the necessary properties
Educational institutions conduct course and scientific research on lecture courses in organic chemistry under the curriculum of the course "Organic Chemistry," course and laboratory classes, but do not pay special attention to environmental education with the issuance of theoretical material through these forms of training
After all, even when analyzing literature for scientific and methodological manuals, it is observed that the environmental education of students through the process of teaching organic chemistry courses in higher educational institutions is not fully provided in the republic
Therefore, in research work, an environmental educational structure should be created in the process of teaching the course of organic chemistry through the concepts of organic chemistry, environmental and environmental concepts for the education of students
For example, one of the first topics of the course of organic chemistry is "Hydrocarbons"
Methane-simple representative of hydrocarbons
Methane-chemical concept
In addition to familiarizing students with the use of ways to obtain the properties of methane homologues, paying attention to the content of the theory on built-in environmental issues, it is necessary to pay special attention to the shortcomings of transportation of these substances.
Oxidizing bacteria release carbon dioxide into the environment with decomposition of about 152· 107 tons of hydrocarbons per year:
Environmental protection measure: in the methane industry by chlorination using the method of waste-free technology, raw materials of organic synthesis are obtained - chloromethane:
When mastering knowledge on the topic of hydrocarbons, students become convinced of the role of bacteria in nature and the formation of carbon dioxide that do not allow methane to accumulate in the air, and students form the concept of the equilibrium of nature about the reverse effect of methane in the biosphere
In this regard, the role of the concept of bilateral chemical production will develop and deepen.
Firstly, the production of organic substances necessary for society for the national economy, and secondly, pollution of nature by production waste
The objective of the training phase is to deepen the development of chemical environmental and environmental concepts [2]
At the same time, during the course of the topic "Oxygen organic compounds" in courses of organic chemistry, monitoring the activities of students by subtracting environmental content reports will reveal the intellectual development of their cognitive interest in environmental and chemical knowledge
For example, aldehyde is one of the pollutants found in the air of the city
This compound (40% by weight) comprises carbon (667%) hydrogen and oxygen.
Find the molecular formula of Aldehyde
Answer: CH2O
Or calculate the volume of carbon dioxide generated on each test table in a chemical laboratory with a volume of 80 m3 if 23 g of ethyl alcohol burns
Does it have an impact on human health?
When issuing these reports, students improve theoretical knowledge about the chemical properties of aldehyde and ethyl alcohol and determine the environmental impact of these organic compounds
Theoretical chemical sciences and performance of qualification works are combined with the experience of compliance with technical safety rules, as well as chemical and environmental concepts are integrated in accordance with the interconnection of the structure of environmental-scientific education in the course of organic chemistry [3]:
Chemical reaction	environmental pollutant
(carbon dioxide)
human exposure to the pollutant
Thus, chemical reports with environmental content examined the use of chemical compounds and their impact on the human body on the environment
The solution of such reports allows interpreting chemical knowledge in modern conditions to represent the process going on in the environment
Therefore, in the organization of independent work of students in organic chemistry, quantitative calculations with such environmental content occupy a special place [4]
In educational conditions, it is impossible to master the real scientific structure of education, therefore, in order to determine the scientific basis of discipline, a structural system of environmental education should be created in the process of teaching the course of organic chemistry, that is:
Provide concrete examples of the goals and objectives of organic chemistry education in environmental education;
reflection and disclosure of the main directions of greening the course of organic chemistry;
analysis of environmental issues of organic compounds included in the content of the course of organic chemistry in educational institutions in accordance with these directions;
concurrent formation of environmental concepts in the formation of basic chemical concepts;
Clarification of how to familiarize themselves with industrial and agricultural industries in terms of environmental issues;
Consider as the basis for the implementation of an interdisciplinary link in environmental education and the formation of a unified approach to students about nature and society
Environmental knowledge gained by students at lecture courses is supplemented and specified in laboratory practical exercises
Students in laboratory work together with an understanding of the cognitive role of chemical experiments:
is trained in demonstrations in accordance with didactic requirements with the correct setting of a chemical experiment;
effectively organize research and correctly summarize the results of the training experiment
Improving the content of the environmental chemical experiment
Shaikheslyamova defined five directions for greening the chemical experiment [5]:
The use of analytical methods to determine the environmental status of the environment;
cleaning and disposal of waste generated from chemical reactions;
the use of a chemical experiment to understand natural phenomena;
studies of the effects of certain substances on living organisms and the ecosystem;
creating environmental practices
During the implementation of these directions, students will get acquainted with the environment
In conclusion, the goals and goals of educating a citizen who can provide the young generation with environmental education, preserve the nature and unity of human life and protect it, must be achieved without eliminating their vitality to date, and further develop it.

Calculation of volume ratios of gases
When calculating the volume ratios of gases according to chemical equations, it should be remembered that the amount of interacting and formed gas substances is proportional to the dimensions of these substances:
The amount of substance for which this property is characteristic only of gaseous substances is the coefficient before the reaction equations
1-example: volume 5l
how much oxygen is required for the oxidation of methyl amine?

Mole Concentration Calculations
Example: Determine molar concentration of sodium hydroxide with weight fraction 02 density 122g/cm3
To derive such calculations, it is necessary to know the concept of molar concentration (See)
Its simple formula is expressed as follows:
V (male); where V is the amount of substance mole;
V (er-di) - volume of solution l
Then the unit of measurement of this concentration will be mol/l
To record compactness in the calculations, this concentration is supplied by the large letter M 15M, for example, the word sulfuric acid means that 15mol/l or 1l contains 15mol of sulfuric acid
As for the report, the mass fraction of 02 indicates that 100 g of sodium hydroxide is contained in the 20 g solution.
To detect the molar concentration of this substance, it is necessary to convert the mass of sodium hydroxide into the amount of the substance (mol), and the mass of the solution into the volume
SM  05 mol/008197 L  61mol/L or 61 M solution NaOH

) In () 3mol/l 02l 06mol
By the amount of substance found, we detect the mass of orthophosphoric acid:
Molar mass of orthophosphoric acid:
Answer: Weight of orthophosphoric acid in solution of molar concentration 3 mol/lcul 200 ml 588 g
Calculations for preparation of a new solution with mixing of said concentration solutions
Such calculations are used to determine the weight of the two mentioned solutions necessary to obtain a new solution, including various massive fractions or solutions with different densities.
According to this method, we compose a cruciform proportion, that is, we prescribe the mass fraction of the prepared or new solution in percent to the center of the cruciform proportion, and the mass fraction of the added solutions in percent on the left and right sides of the cross:
where 0% corresponds to water, because it does not have a soluble substance
0% 25% secondary substance 25% ammonia solution, and 15% 15% its prepared solution
Subsequently, if a smaller number is deducted diagonally from a large number, then they reflect the mass ratio of liquid substances added, that is, 1 kg or 1000 g 15% - the mass ratio of water and 25% ammonia solution for preparing a solution of vertical ammonia should be 10:15
Weight of water from this m (H2O) = 1000
10 (10 + 15) = 400 g, and 400 g of water should be added to a 25% solution of vertical ammonia
Note: the mass ratios of solutions above can be reduced by a total number, for example 10:15, reducing the ratio by five and writing the ratio 2:3
Example: How many grams of anhydrous salt and water is needed to prepare a 50g 5% soda solution? Solution:
method
From this follows:
method (algebraic)
From this follows:
To obtain a 19% acid solution, it is necessary to cool with the addition of water in 400 grams of its 95% solution.
How many liters of water is needed for this and how much kg of liquefied solution will then be obtained?
Solution:
Method 1
First we will find out how many grams of dissolved H2SO4 in 400 grams of 95% solution
From this follows:
Now, considering that the mass of the acid should be 19% of the solution 380g, we calculate and detect the mass of the solution: [7]
Mass of connecting water m (water) 2000 380 1620 g
The report contract does not require the mass of water added
To find her, we have to find water
we need to know the density
Its value r = 1g/ml

"The Role of Information Technology in Teaching the Release of Chemistry Reports"
One of the most important components in the teaching of natural disciplines is considered chemistry education, which, as is known, does not increase the quality and importance of students without their ability to keep records in chemistry
A great deal of attention has always been paid to teaching chemical accounting
The program, which is guided by the teacher, systematically provides training in reporting, with its constant execution, the student forms chemical thinking
But the allocation of fewer hours to chemistry training prevents its systematic consideration by the lack of internal motivation and other reasons for teaching many students to extract a report from chemistry
Information technology plays a big role in the organization of chemistry training
The use of information technologies in teaching and producing reports from chemistry allows the use of dialogue learning, combining activity and individual training of students, providing new opportunities for transferring information to expand the learning space of students
Information technology, chemical reports, student reports

ICQ teleconference simulation model
Currently, in the educational systems of the university, training in all disciplines is being introduced by computer modeling programs
Computer modeling and analysis are a dynamically developing direction of informatization, based on the application of simulation models, and are widely used in economics in industry in the use of subsoil in ecology and other areas of human activity.
It cannot be said that at present any person does not use any modelling methods in the field of activity
Especially at the heart of the management of various industries and systems are decisions made on the basis of information received in them
Currently, computer modeling and analysis are a dynamically developing direction of informatization, based on the application of simulation models, and are widely used in the economy in industry in the use of subsoil in ecology and other areas of human activity.
Modeling of objects with different physical nature is one of the ways of scientific cognition, and the main laws of the process of creating models are investigated in various sections of the theories of cognition
Modeling methods are at the heart of management theory and are widely used in the applied sections of this science
A special place in a given direction is occupied by the issues of creating sound mathematical models for the purpose of adaptive control [1]
Modelling is one of the main methods of environmental research and a tool in the scientific and practical activities of specialists in all fields of activity
The purpose of modeling is to study the properties and characteristics, as well as to predict the order of designed and specific systems, the direct study of which is impractical or impossible for some reason.
Currently, the computer is a universal tool that includes all the known methods of implementing models
There is no doubt that information technology has dramatically lost the level of complexity of processes that can lead to modeling
The essence of computer modeling is to obtain the object of the phenomenon in a serviceable form for using the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the system process in practical activities.
The model is a visible analogue of phenomena that reflect the laws of change of a particular object or make up the object of parts, their relationship
Creating a model and analyzing it is called modeling
The simulation will identify solutions to many problems of service systems in the financial sectors of the economy
Plans created by modeling can be changed to quotation validation
Issues of computerization and informatization of society in various fields of science and education
around was written many printed works
The process of informatization of the field of education consists in the development of methods of using the technical and didactic potential of computer technologies for the development of the student's personality with the support of integration trends in recognition of environmental laws and the subject industry, increasing the student's level of creativity, developing the ability to develop strategic ways to solve educational and practical problems
A special place in the discipline "New information technologies in chemical education" is occupied by the resources and capabilities of the Internet and computer programs for chemistry
In obtaining the knowledge in front of the computer and the necessary materials, the continuous individual employment of the student in front of the computer significantly reduces the time to master basic knowledge
Get acquainted with special programs for chemistry and learn how to work with them
In addition, students learn the information to implement their materials on the Internet, necessary for practical work
The program provides modern Internet connectivity from e-mail to ICQ teleconference
One of the main achievements of the discipline - future teachers open sites for their professional work and master their processing
Training in electronic textbooks and online testing
Learn how to correctly identify Internet settings and monitor network health
Familiarize yourself with the technical mechanisms of the Internet

Pedagogical experience in teaching organic chemistry using computer modeling
From 2013 to 2015, students of the 3rd year of the Kazakh Women's Pedagogical University
The purpose of conducting pedagogical experience using this computer modeling technique was to develop the knowledge and qualifications of university students and demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology
First, a student survey was conducted to test the effectiveness of computer programs
10 students participated in the survey "Efficiency of computer modeling programs"
Table 1 Student questionnaire results
Methods of lecture seminars for students were developed in accordance with the curriculum on technology "Training in computer modeling programs"
Based on these methods, lectures and seminars were held
In order to verify the knowledge and qualifications of students, the following methods were used in pedagogical practice:
receiving test works from students;
performance of control works analysis;
testing of students' independent search work;
protection of research works using this methodology
A workshop was held for 3 year students using the HyperChem program in the "Alcohols" section
During the lesson, students learned to work with HyperChem
Student knowledge indicators and criteria were reviewed at three levels (high mean low)
At the end of the seminar, students were given tasks of various levels and control work was received
Results of control work of students after application of the program HyperChem
The table shows that before the experiment, the number of students of a high level, that is, education 30%, after the experiment, the indicator increased by 20%, and for students of secondary and low levels the level of education decreased by 10%
It follows that when teaching organic chemistry, it is more effective to use computer modeling programs
In the end, the lessons of the computer modeling workshop can be seen in the lagging interests of students

Mountain Altai ancient peoples of the Sargat culture of the Arimaspo tribes, the Mayamir period of the kulazhorg period, the early iron clan leader of the mounds of the Saka-Scythian world
Only archaeological research begun since the 20th century forced scientists to return to caution
At the origins of such an angle, the famous scientists A.
Freiman and Kazakh scientists A.
K. Margulan Orazbaev
Ginsburg and O
Smagulovs lived
Scientists were able to take a new approach to the topic of caution, based on the results of archaeological anthropological research they began
At first, special attention had to be paid to the geography of the historical location of the reserves
For this, it would be impossible not to delve deeply into the geography of Strabo
In ancient Greek records, two different associations of saks are mentioned
One of them is the reserves inhabiting the eastern valley of modern Syr Darya, the former Tanais, and the other is the massifs in the south of the island
In addition, in ancient times, Greek authors distinguish three groups of sacks: issedons and arimaspas
Herodotus clearly demonstrated the geography of the location of the Arhippean tanks and Issedonian groups
The author wrote that the Arhippeans were located at the foot of the "high mountains" (possibly southeast of the Urals), and the explorers stood east of the foothills
According to Issedonov themselves - the author further says that they also lived the famous tribes of the Arimas and the "golden-eared samurai"
We are talking about the north-east of Kazakhstan or Altai
Altai semantics means "Altai" (gold) [1]
Ours-and in the tract Rustem near Persepol, among the three Saki groups located at the Persian rule, are mentioned in the letter of King Darius on the coffin
In the relief record
The name "Tigrahau Storage" is given as the definition of a saka soldier dressed in pig canvas
This is confirmed by Achaemin's records
It says that the Saki parts inhabiting the lands of Central Asia and Kazakhstan include chaomavars and Paradarai groups in Tigrahau
And Akishev will place a group of tigrahau in Kyrgyzstan and the South Kazakhstan Historical Territory
The author gave a place to the Paradaray department from the southeast of the Caspian Sea
The cliffs of Paradaraya are depicted in a Mongoloid form in the handwriting of Persepolis in the tentacle
But K
And Akishev suggests that the cautious image of Persepol is a statue not of the Paradaraians, but of the Tigrachau warrior by Tanirtau Zhetysu Shash
Be that as it may, in Tigrachau it is impossible to separate warehouses from paradaraic ones.
Cultural monuments of these groups are very similar to each other
Saki units united in military alliances on the basis of a tribe
In Tigrahau, the union should consist of an exploratory of aristes and arhippeans
There are authors referring arhippaea to another storage group [2]
And Herodotus believes that the Arhippeans should be sought as part of the Tigrachau alliance than the "inhabitants of the highlands," which are classified as Mongolian.
If expledon and Argentines inhabit Altai Tien Shan according to Zhetysu Ili, then they cannot be separated from the Yuezhi of the Turkish group
Ptolomew recognizes nests as early explorers
Ptolomew then cites this hypothesis A.
Bernstam confirmed
He believes that "Saktar is a direct descendant of the locals who inhabited Zhetysu and Tien Shan, formed under the influence of the ethnic groups of Southern Siberia during the Andronov era" [3]
Bernstam's opinions on the relationship between Saki and Uisin cultures are interesting
His opinions on the relationship between Saka-Uisin culture are very interesting
He recognizes Saki culture as "two stages of one historical and cultural process"
This forecast of Bernstam determined the results of archaeological research conducted in Kazakhstan in recent years
Many components of cultural heritage found from a comparative study of archaeologists and from domain mounds, in some cases very similar to each other, look unmistakably repeating each other
What conclusions can be drawn? Sakuisintanator K
Akishev and G
If we turn to the opinion of the Kushaev, then the native peoples inhabited Ile Zhetysu Tien Shan as a foreign ally from the cautious and uysin.
In certain periods, they called one of their predecessors
For example, according to Altai, Zhetys Talas Shu, as a political union, when the Turkeshkars established political domination, his name disappeared.
In the III-II centuries, when the ancestors of history appeared in this region, the tribal union as pious.
Of course, in this way, as a political union, the sacred name remained in my ancient estate, where I was careful, and it got such a name that it did not go the other way.
Like cautious Yuezhi, it is impossible to separate from fear
The first thoughts about this were French scientists Klaprot and Abel Remuzy
Scientists, based on Chinese data, note that Yuechevets are homogeneous peoples
This opinion, which initially did not receive such support, in recent years has become supported not only by Chinese and Western European, but also by Russian-Slavic and Kazakh historians.
Familiarization with consumption sections of Klyashtor Scythians with related sockets
Tolstov considers massagets in the east "great yuechs"
Bichurin writes that the Yuechevets are a people with gendarmes
Historian A.
Amar's vision calls the land west of the Yellow River, and the country - sihe
In the period from the II to III centuries e, under pressure from the Shurshites, the community of se (Sak) ousted from its population called Turkic guardians [4]
Be that as it may, they were simply "Indo-Europeans," or simply "Turks," which seems impossible.
Saki became a confederate community in the structure of thousands of ethnic composition
Their Western language culture group was close to the Turks
The cultural and linguistic situation of this community has developed on the basis of these regional characteristics
The first steppe states - some nationalities and tribal units that refused to obey them in the era of Huns domination moved west
In the middle of the II century, gardens began to supplant
Southwestern parts of Cook moved to Driangian land and remained in Atanypson
Today Iran - Seistanis in Afghanistan
In the history of Iran and Pashtun, this group is considered strangers, and not indigenous peoples
Seistanovites and some of them reached India and became close to the locals.
One of the branches of the East of the twentieth century
Nehru is recognized as one of the "great Turkish nomads" who arrived on Indian soil
At the beginning of the 16th century, when Babur Khan captured Kandahar Nanchinhar and attacked western India, they were met without a fight in arms, the descendants of these ancient Saki-Turks [5]
The excitement in the eastern part of the park began with the period when the great Jesuits began to move to this region
Part of the warehouses is shifted south due to the relocation of skeletons to the Ili Zhetysu region due to poisonous ioses
The remaining parts, seeing traces of foreigners, are connected with the Alan and other Turkic tribes who moved to Ile Zhetysu
From this moment on, the name "sak" is supplanted from history as a unit of the tribe
As is known in history, nomads who became famous for "cautious" solemnly opened the VIII-IX century under this name
He left a significant mark on human civilization
One of the regions that preserved the Saki heritage is the modern Kazakh steppe
Of course, it cannot be said that the sagas were Kazakhs
But today it is not controversial that the Kazakh people are the historical heir to these ancient Saks
The Kazakh people is not only the historical and cultural heir to the Saks, but also preserving many elements of life and ethnography
Cautious nomads became a multi-ethnic confederate military alliance along three different ethnocultural elements - the Iranian-Indian Aryan-European and Turkic
The arrival of Iranian elements in Central Asia and the Kazakh steppe consists of three stages
The first is the Iranian Khanate (b
VI-V) era
During this period, in all the regions where Achaemenes ruled, historical and ethnographic life-tradition left a cultural mark
Few data on the conquered countries and lands of Achaemena are preserved in Persian
Historical cognitive position (stereoitypos), which the generalists recognize as Indian-Iranians - the product of conclusions based on these events
Moreover, in the 9th-10th centuries, the conquest of Turkestan by the Arabs in the 8th-9th centuries was dominated by the Samanid dynasty, where in the middle of the 14th century the Khan of the Golden Horde adopted the Uzbek Muslim religion as the official religion - after glory in Central Asia and the Kazakh steppe under the influence of the spiritual priority of Muslims in this antiquity.
The share of Greco-Slavic elements in the appearance of a cognitive stereotype, which only Indo-Europeans consider tanks
This is due, firstly, to the fact that the Black Sea Don was part of the Indo-European tribes along the Dnieper, and secondly, to the formation of the Greco-Bactrian Khanate, which conquered the Afghan Turkestan land by Alexander the Great.
And the consumption group of reserves is mainly nomadic Turks
The authenticity of the above is determined by the results of archaeological and paleontological research in each region
Monuments found in the Ili Altai East Kazakhstan Territory are ethnocultural cultures of Turkestan Cheese.
In most of them, mixed integral features of culture are observed
Z, who in recent years studied the Berelsky burial ground
A group of archaeologists led by Samashev based his study on the assumption that "the owners of the monuments of Berel are one of the tribal unions known as" yuezhi, "which unite Indo-Iranian and Altai-Turkish tribes found in Chinese data" [6] This opinion was previously expressed by S.
Rudenko spoke
Altai tribes of the Scythian-Saki era are not often found in the works of Greek authors
Only in Herodotus: "On the slopes of high mountains live people who do not look like Scythians or Savromats.
They speak a special language, dress Scythians and feed on tree juice
drink juice with milk
not so many cattle
lives on a tree
In winter, the tree shines in the summer in white felt "-
Herodotus classifies this population as a group of Argentines
Herodotus, who does not have a mundasosis, points to the Turks of Altai [7]
Argippei are only part of the ancient Turks located in the eastern part of the reserve
Mongolian-Altai monuments of the Scythian-Saki era have not been fully studied
If it is fully investigated, it can lead to the discovery of Orchon-Yenisei culture.
Archaeologists of Kazakhstan reveal secrets of Turkic elements of Skif-Saki era from year to year [8]
The results of such studies would exclude a concept that would consider the Turkish-Mongolian elements of Saki culture as "the fruit of the cultural expansion of the nomads of the East," separating the Saki era from the Turkic elements
Akishev, studying the mustache in the burial grounds found in the right valley of Ile, recognized them not as fruits of "expansion," but as various periods of ancient homogeneous culture, continuing with each other [9]
The results of research in the villages of Besshatyr Berel indicate the wide development of carpentry in the daily life of the Saks

Now the study of the history of the Great Silk Road is resuming its modernization, building up the political economic and cultural ties of countries along the way
In 1987, the XXIV session of the UNESCO General Conference adopted the "International Project for the Study of the Great Silk Road"
Greece Portugal Egypt Italy China Indonesia Mongolia Sri Lanka Oman participated in the project of the former Union of Soviets
It approved the programs "Culture and the Future" "Land of the human environment and marine funds"
With regard to the implementation of these programmes in 1991
National Silk Road Committee established in Kazakhstan
In the ancient Great Silk Road, cultural connection for the people of Eurasia is of great importance for solving political spiritual issues [1]
The location of the region on the Great Silk Road in the early Middle Ages, in which tribal habitation can indicate the wide location of the Muslim religious movement here, as well as the fact that the prosperity of large cities that left Kazakh land after the culture of settlement and agriculture, testifies to this today
I think that we should not talk more about the golden cradle or bridge, which will allow the development of archaeological tourism in the South Kazakhstan region today.
It is clear that this historical path became "Silk" in connection with the silk trade
And the accession of the word "Great" to it is associated with the latitudinal Eastern Territories and Western Territories.
Therefore, this path went down in history as the Great Silk Road
It also served as a mutual exchange of trade relations between the population and the scientific and technical achievements of the culture of religion [2]
At the same time, on the Southern Silk Road, not only the transportation of goods, but also culture has become one of the main links between art, religious beliefs and the writing of culture
The variety of objects of historical and cultural heritage of these cities surprises the innovative solutions of scientific and technical thought with a high artistic level of wood products made of clay metal
Compared to others, historically, a special place is located on the border of settled and nomadic civilizations.
The historical roots are cities dating back to the VIII-III centuries BC.
Here, at the lower mouth of the Syr Darya, excavations of monumental ornaments of the Saks were carried out
Their study indicates that the ancient inhabitants of South Kazakhstan mastered not only the technique of making raw bricks, but also the technical component of the continent
In the developed medieval period, South Kazakhstan through the Otyrara Valley became one of the largest centers of urban civilization in Kazakhstan, as well as throughout Central Asia
Chinese Eastern European cultures and civilizations intertwined with each other
Muslim Christian Zoroastrian religions interacted with each other
Today in South Kazakhstan region often travel for purposes of pilgrimage and restoration of health
Program tours "Holy places of South Kazakhstan region" created for pilgrimage trips for 3 days 2 nights
In the region there is a moderate change in seasonality
In the summer season, there are more and more travelers, and in the winter season - calmer
To change this situation, it is necessary to develop based on the above-mentioned tourism guides
Nevertheless, tourism today is a region with excellent opportunities for the development of archeology in contrast to these types of tourism
There are no reasons for the constant development of archaeological tourism, such as seasonality of tourism
Therefore, archaeological tourism of South Kazakhstan region today occupies a special place
Because scientists have studied the Kazakh land, not to mention the "museum in the open sky" [34]
Famous archaeologist K.
Baipakov in an interview with "Islands Discovered in Archeology" - Our successes in archeology have not gone unnoticed at the international level
It certainly has a positive impact on the active development of archeology and culture in our country
This is evidenced by the inclusion in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 2004 of eight antiquities from Kazakhstan
Previously, only 2 artifacts were recognized
These are the mausoleum of Hodge Ahmet Yasaui and the burial ground of the Markala petroglyphs
Are eight of these two monuments not a major success?! Of course, archaeological steps will continue in the coming years
In the near future, we plan to include a number of medieval cities in the World Heritage List
Among them - the city of Zhankent near Otyrar Turkestan Sauran Syzhanak Aral [5]
The path through the South Kazakhstan and Zhetysu highways of the Silk Road, through the terisia and east to the Central Kazakhstan and East Kazakhstan regions, later known as Saryarka, crossed the Irtysh embankment and Altai to Mongolia
A steppe road passed between them, along which nomad tribes rode
Thus, the region of Central Kazakhstan, rich in wool and metal for skins, will be connected to the trading system, including international, and will intersect with the Silk Road node with a large number of caravans
Otyrar was at the junction of nine roads
One of the branches of the road from it to Shawgar, through the Syrdarya isthmus, was heading to the city of Vasizha
Climbing up the Syr Darya, the city of Oguz pulled Sutkent into Checkers, and down into Jent
One of the common road lines passes through Arsubaniket to the Arashanda Shayan valleys, and the line from Shawgar and Iasi exceeds the Turlan pass, and the Sauran and Syaganak branches - towards the Yangikent branch.
The Great Silk Road is a landmark in the history of world civilization
Branched caravan systems crossed Europe and Asia from the Mediterranean Sea to China, in ancient times and the Middle Ages were an important tool of a diologist between the West and the East
Two main paths, the directions of the Silk Road, which have not changed, constantly remain:
southern road - from the north of China through Central Asia to the Middle East and Northern India;
northern path - from the north of China through the Pamirs to the waters of the Lower Volga and the Black Sea
In the share of ancient cities located on the Great Silk Road, there was little fire-famine [6]
Formation of the Great Silk Road in the early epoch b
Corresponds to the II millennium
researchers in their writings gave information about China and described the routes to the country
This is the first characteristic of this road that has reached us in the future of the Great Silk Road
And this is a description on paper - b
End of the 1st century
Ptolemy himself made this description from the work of Mark of Tyre, who has not reached our time, and the border city on the banks of the Euphrates River, a descendant of the merchant Maya Titian, passing through Gierapol through Mesopotamia to the Tigris River, and then to Ecbatan in the Medes, south of the Caspian Sea ian Sea, to the capital of perfume.
From there he went to the capital of China
The classic ancient description of the road, later called the Great Silk Road
The long process of the formation of the Great Silk Road is evidence of the gradual recognition of each other by the Western and Eastern civilizations of the ancient world and China
For several centuries, even for several thousand years, the world did not know anything about China - the largest settler in the Far East
At the intersection of Kazakhstan land from the VI century, two directions are widely deployed: Syrdarya and Tien-Shan caravan routes
The first road began from China through East Turkestan (Kashkar) and passed further through Zhetysu and Syrdarya in the Aral region (sometimes through Khorezm to Mangystau to the lower reaches of the Urals, sometimes to the banks of the Volga and Don to the Caucasus, sometimes through the Black Sea coast to the Middle East and Byzantium).
In this direction was the Syr Darya River, which continued the West and East
Trade cities Zhetysu and South Kazakhstan - Suyab Navakent Kulan Taraz Ispizhab Arsubankent Otyrar Shavgar Yangikent
The second road starts from East Turkestan (Kashkar) and passes through Zhetysa (Shu Ili valleys) to Shashk (Tashkent) along the Zhungar Ili Kyrgyz Talas highlands
Samarkant connected with Byzantium with Asia Minor through Merv Bukhara
Cities along the way - Suyab Balasagun Talhir Kulan Taraz Ispizhab Gazgird (Kazygurt)
These cities in ancient times were the centers of the path of merchants from Japan to Korea and China to Central Asia, then to Russia and Byzantium (Figure 1)
Figure 1
Map of the Great Silk Road
Trade and trade relations along the Great Silk Road served as a mutual exchange of scientific and technical achievements of religion among the population
The Great Silk Road is one of the historical monuments of human civilization
Major cities Sauran Taraz Otyrar Ispijab and t
cities began to flourish
The largest of them was the city of Ispizhab, which brought goods and sold them in exchange
In particular, among the crop plants grown in hands along this road, peach fruits of Central Asia of the East were sold - tiger tiger skins and Chinese Silk
Diplomatic Relations Emergence at that time In connection with the trade route, you can fully observe the agreements between the Turkish Khaganate and the Byzantine state of 568 and have information about the relations of the Uisin state with the Chinese authorities
Buddhist religions from the west spread through Central Asia and East Turkestan, and Islamic religions from Iran and Arab countries from Syria
In messages in Chinese credentials b
In the II-I centuries:
The waterless desert steppes of the Great Silk Road passed through the inaccessible mountain peaks of glacier lakes
Along it were merchant caravans transporting special goods in different directions;
The Great Silk Road in the XIV-XV centuries lost its significance in connection with the discovery of great geographical discoveries, that is, sea routes [4 6 7]
With the life of the Great Silk Road, the concept of "four kingdoms of the world" appeared
Byzantium - kingdom of valuable wealth Turkish kaganate-equestrian kingdom
China - the kingdom of man - India is called the kingdom of elephants
Trade was largely in exchange form
During archaeological research, the remains of silk clothes from Turkic cemeteries were discovered, and from the townspeople - sources from the Byzantine countries of China
This indicates the existence of economic ties in the early Middle Ages
This is the period when silk was known throughout Eurasia in the VIV century [8]
Currently, the use of the Great Silk Road in tourism shows very attractive results
In order to preserve and effectively use the monuments of archeology and architecture of the Ancient town of Otyrar and ensure the creation of an effective system for their study and popularization in accordance with the decree of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, guided by the Program "Restoration of Ancient Otyrar" for 2004-2009, 1762 hectares were allocated from the area of ​ ​ the district.
This project has been postponed for years due to the financial crisis
In accordance with this program, the goal is to create favorable conditions for the development of tourism infrastructure in the region for 2011-2015
More active work is envisaged to create the attractiveness of the tourist image of the region and participation in international exhibitions and fairs
Work on establishing business links in the field of tourism will be launched with the provision of information "On tourist opportunities of the Otyrar region" through the website of the region
Measures aimed at the protection of monuments and the environment in the use of tourism resources, the creation of favourable conditions for the accumulation of capital and their investment in tourism with the application of a system of benefits and preferences for the construction of tourism infrastructure [9]
On December 3, at Akeila and Incheburn stations in Turkmenistan, the grand opening of the North-South transnational railway was held, linking the three countries with the participation of the heads of state of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran
This significant event - a significant part of the regional and international transport infrastructure - the new transport corridor embodied the idea of ​ ​ modernizing the Great Silk Road, which for centuries connected the peoples of Eurasia
Speaking here, President Nursultan Nazarbayev compared the Kazakh-Turkmen-Iranian railway with the new Silk Road
- Today we have built a new Silk Road through three countries and China to the Pacific Ocean -
He noted that the launch of this railway is of great importance for Kazakhstan
"We have long dreamed of a further journey to Iran in the Persian Gulf
Now our dream has come true
Three countries - Kazakhstan Turkmenistan and Iran, having built a railway with a length of 900 kilometers, opened relations with the countries of the Persian Gulf through Iran to all Central Asian states and Kazakhstan, "the President said.
This is the victory of an independent country
Now we will have a railway connection with Iran [10]

Mound Valley "Dragon" "Tasbaka" Mars
The specially protected territory of Sharyn is located in the Enbekshikazakh Rayymbek and Uygur districts of Almaty region
Organized in accordance with Government Decision No. 213 of 2004
Initially, the area was 932 thousand hectares, and in 2010 the area was expanded to 127050 hectares [1]
On the territory of Sharyn National Park there is a special natural structure - Sharyn Canyon
Shagan Grove (Eren Sheten) and Sharyn Gorge as part of the National Park have been protected as a natural monument of republican significance since 1964
The park includes desert terrain bordering the Sngeti valley of the Bolshaya Plotina ridge, the Pink Fortresses valley along the Sharyn River, the left-bank steppe valley and the slopes of Mount Toraigyr
The Sharyn River and several of its regions flow through the park
The annual amount of dry precipitation in the park is 150 mm
Especially noteworthy is the view of the valleys of "pink castles," preserved from ancient times in the park
An unusual type of relief that caused the opening of the park - Sharyn Gorge
940 species of plants grow in the park, of which about 60 species are endemic
21 species of plants contained in them are protected and listed in the Red Book of Kazakhstan
Of the 60 species of mammals, 300 birds and 20 species of reptiles, 10 species of fish are found
Famous traveler-biologist about the plant and animal world of the Sharyn Gorge P.
You can read from the works of Marikovsky
His work "Fate of Charin" was published in 1997
In his work, he expressed concern about the preservation of the bioresources of the gorge with its natural appearance in the future
The project of a hydroelectric power station with the Moynak reservoir, built in the upper reaches of the Sharyn River, was planned at a government meeting
Marikovsky noted that water supply will lead to a decrease in river water levels in the future
Lowering the water level may lead to the temporary disappearance of the Shagan tree growing on the banks of the river [2]
Since the Shagan tree loves water, it grows only on the banks of the river
Secondly, Chagan is a tree of the triple period, rare in the world not only in Kazakhstan
In Russian, this tree is called "Ash," but has several names
In dictionaries with scientific literature it is written "chagan"
In addition, "extreme" is called "driven"
So what do the locals still call?
In the Ana T_l _ newspaper of Rysbaya Satimbekov "the Sharynsky gorge - a surprising gift of the nature" the local journalist Zhanbolat Alikhanovich
the name of the tree is written about proof that it is "eren"
As for the shintwite, the time has come to dwell on the name of the tree [3]
As for the Sharyn Gorge, where we are dealing with our article, large canyons, such as balls on the ground, are found in many countries
The longest canyon was determined in 2013
The length of the canyon under the Greenland glacier is 750 km, depth - 800 meters, width - 10 km
The deepest canyon in Peru has a depth of Cotahuasi of 3535 meters
Depth of the famous Grand Canyon 1600 meters
Depth of Sharyn canyon 150-300 meters
The formation of the gorge dates back 10-12 million years
If so, then the gorge appeared in the Neogene era
In the Neogene era, the Tien Shan Mountains were giant mountains denudated for millions of years
The mountain's re-ascent occurred at the beginning of the fourth era
In parallel with the rise of the mountains on the Pleitocene, an icebreaker occurred
As a result of the melting of glaciers after the last glacier, the main channel of modern large rivers Northern Tien Shang was formed
At the same time, the modern channel of the Sharyn River developed during these periods
Tourists are interested in the "Kurgan Valley" on the old Sharyn Canal
Locals called the "City of Shaitan" valley "Pink Fortresses"
Precipitation in the gorge formed a modern picture, especially under the influence of the wind
Sphinx Medan Kempir Dragon
"Turtle" and others
One of the main services of national parks is the development of recreational and tourist work [4]
As part of the national park, it is worth paying more attention to the fact that the gorge has high potential to attract tourists
To do this, firstly, it is necessary to repair the road to the Kurgan Valley
Secondly, it is necessary to regulate the stepped trail to the valley
The path of such a step should be done in several places
I say that tourists stretch far to look at the plain above the gorge
When descending to the heels of the gorge, you have to return back to the bus stop
Because there is no other way
In 2013, we hosted guests from St. Petersburg in December
They jumped out of the bus and walked for a long time along the gorge from above
Now we have not found a single trail to go down
The guests are surprised that this is a beautiful place, similar to the Martian planet.
It is clear that I lack advertising
3 tourist routes in the park attract more vacationers, including the Kurgan Valley
The annual report of park managers for the past year describes the work performed along these three routes [5]
Commissioning of built holiday homes and cottage in the Chagan grove area
In our opinion, such places are often needed in the area of ​ ​ mound valleys
To do this:
Asphalt the black road from the Almaty-Kegen highway to the valley;
Above the plain on the upper side of the hangar along the valley should build small holiday homes
The door of the house should look into the valley
In front of the tourist from the morning sleep would be a beautiful panorama of nature;
Along hangars and holiday homes, it is necessary to diversify the landscape with the planting of various types of trees;
Due to the fact that the Sharyn River is convenient for use in raft sports, it is necessary to open its base here;
To attract tourists, there will be less than three routes in the park, for which it is necessary to connect the Kolsay lakes in Kulsay National Park to the Kayynda lakes route
Tourists are interested in a wide variety of sights of the landscape
This route (for 3-4 days) would benefit two national parks;
To bring the two national parks closer together, the road issue must first be repaired;
It is necessary to strengthen advertising in this direction
Last year, more than 45 thousand tourists arrived in the park
If there are two beautiful canyons in the world, the number of tourists does not match
More than 2 million tourists visit a large canyon in the United States per year
The large canyon is located much further than the Sharyn canyon
Thanks to the advertising of a large canyon, most of the world's population recognizes:
Due to the confluence of sand clays and gravel rocks in castles, their appearance changes annually
Among the natural stone sculptures there are images similar to the various animals that I mentioned above
They just do not go far in this state
Therefore, you need to make a photo album with their photos
There will be no more if they come up with a small legend, making them polite names
When visiting, we observe the image of different animals
their image depends on the point of view
It would be great if they were recruited by smart names
Tourist guides would become irreparable material

The article provides for the features of tourism in Kazakhstan
Attention is paid to peculiarities of domestic external tourism development in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan is characterized by each period of tourism
Tourism affects not only the economy, but also politics and the social situation
Innovation in science plays an important role in the world among developed nations
Innovation contributes to a competitive economy
Innovative development - improving the quality of life - environmental protection is the most effective tool for ensuring national security and realizing the most important tasks in the course of economic and social development
Today, the upcoming US states Japan Great Britain Germany Singapore China Canada - the main position of development in the country - an increase in sources of speculative financing of programs of republican significance should be emphasized.
The economy of any country in the face of fierce competition, as global practice shows, has turned out to be significantly dependent on innovative development
Therefore, today our country has chosen the path of innovative development in order to constantly accelerate the economy
In recent years, the main priorities in the development of the economy of Kazakhstan are also to increase the innovative ability of technology and scientific discovery services in various areas of society development
Currently, the development of knowledge-intensive domestic production indicates a wide field of work on the development of new technology and information technologies that require the production of competitive products
Currently, Japan France Finland Sweden and Canada have been living in conditions of accelerated economic and social sustainable development for several years
This information period consists in the fact that computer technology and all related information and communication technologies are integrated into many subject areas in which all students are trained
turns into a natural and native environment
The article analyzed the issues about the opportunities of innovative development of Kazakhstan and the implementation of innovative projects in it, comparing the progress of innovative development programs of the states of Canada and the USA with the "Strategy of Industrial and Innovative Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2003-2015" with the definition of economic development positions abroad
Scientific Report of the NSF Science Foundation "Innovative Strategy for Industrial and Innovative Development" Center for Research on Conceptual Technologies of Nano-Biotechnology Center for Marketing and Analytical Research of the G8 (G-8)
It can be seen that over the past decade, the G-8 countries have made significant progress towards innovative development.
This is directly related to the need for economic reforms related to the world economic crisis
(Information technology for the development of human intelligence)
became the main direction of development
Research and Analysis Centers Abroad (Scientific Report of the ES NSF Science Foundation in the USA Rand Corp)
The NBIC revolution in the G8 countries is conducted in different countries in different ways
For example, in Canada 2007
The strategy "Advantages of mobilizing science and technology to achieve an active market" was adopted
Its goal is to intensively carry out innovative development in private sectors, create a national innovation system and include it in the top ten innovatively developed countries of the world
The Strategy has improved the use of investment in the market, creating an enabling environment for private sector investors [1]
The United States began innovative development based on the following tripartite postulates:
The Key to the Future of Scientific Knowledge
Technology Engine for economic and social development
The responsibility of the Government is to promote the development of science and technology
In the US, there is an object of wide partnership between the corporate and private sectors of the federal government with innovative financing of science and technology
Encourages civil-military convergence by addressing organizational and technological barriers between these sectors in the Dual-Use Technologies programme [2]
The main areas of forced industrial and innovative development are:
agro-industrial complex and processing of agricultural products; construction industry and development of construction materials production; development of oil refining infrastructure and oil and gas sector; development of metallurgy and production of finished metal products;
the development of the chemical pharmaceutical and defence industries;
Development of transport and telecommunications infrastructure [3]
One of the important issues for Kazakhstan is the implementation of a single state strategy aimed at introducing high technologies and supporting innovation
Firstly, it is necessary to actively and carefully carry out technology transfer based on competitive advantages in Kazakhstan
Production of individual parts of machine-building products mastered
In the near future, the development of machine-building products for the agricultural and instrument-making industries will begin under this schedule [4]
Secondly, it is necessary to create structures that support financing of high-tech projects, including on a venture basis
The best developments of scientists in Kazakhstan should not be allowed to leak [5]
Since 2004 National Innovation Fund JSC together with Kazakhstani investors created 6 venture funds
"High Technology Fund" Action "Venture Fund" Centras "" Glotur Technology Fund "" Venture Fund "Advant" and "Almaty Venture Capital" "Logycom Perspective Innovations"
NEC share in above-mentioned Kazakhstan venture capital funds 49 percent
Thirdly, encouraging innovative activity of Kazakhstan's business
Great efforts in research and development should be made to broaden the private sector
Public private partnership, widely spread around the world, has positioned itself as one of the effective and possible mechanisms for involving private entrepreneurs in the implementation of socially significant projects [6]
In conclusion, innovative development is a set of measures that will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment and support for entrepreneurship for the formation of a competitive, efficient national industry and high technology industry through various measures [7]
It plays a large role of the state for the implementation of innovative development by analyzing the progress in the formation of the national innovation system with the identification of positive and negative factors to increase the competitiveness of the national economy, characterizing the domestic and foreign experience of innovative development of the economy
The issue of providing sufficient resources for innovative development in the country will be addressed with institutional legal and financial support from the State

Currently, polymers are of great importance, so their production and efficient use are one of the main areas in each industry
Polymers can be seen in which industry or transport culture or medicine defense or space technology
Recently, the production of polymer materials has been growing intensively
Polymer materials in aircraft industry (reactants, rubber teormoplasts, paint sealants) at transport construction (rubber paint bodies and cab sound and heat insulation and decorative parts glazing and lighting parts tyres in fuel supply system and brake system absorbing panels) in medicine (in medical technical operation in surgery in ophthalmology in dentistry biointert and bioassimilable polymers functional units of blood circulation devices and plasma substitutes prolong the effect of drugs and polymeric drugs) agriculture and water management (pipelines to provide water for elements of crop and film sowing plants, water-soluble seed films, soil-forming materials that protect against corrosion and moisture accumulation); food industry (construction materials and coatings of machines for food production canning lacquers of materials for charging and ionites for enamel milk processing); in radio electronics and electronics (adhesive compounds for filling electric machines with devices and cable products, as well as electric motors and generators of communication equipment for pouring semi-automatic chips) in construction (structural elements of buildings sanitary equipment wall panels and door and window frames of pipelines and sound insulation materials) in railway transport (structural elements of cars friction shock-absorbing parts seat fillers and rail connectors with sleepers of external shape of traffic lights, etc.
) is widely supported [1]
The use of polymer materials in the aircraft industry is explained by the wide range of technical properties of gin from their simplicity
Polymer materials are used in the aircraft industry mainly as reinforced plastics
Technical mechanical and caloristic properties of polymer materials have expanded their use for building cabin
Polymer materials of plastic rubber varnishes and paints are required to ensure convenient and safe traffic
The use of plastics is expanding in transport construction
Cabins of transport bodies and their separate large-sized structures are made of plastics
It is a tire inside rubber products, the most important for transport construction

Environmentalists in many countries suggest the use of environmentally friendly packaging materials prohibiting the use of polyethylene
To solve this problem, scientists have begun to produce biodiversity polymers from environmentally friendly "non-oil" natural raw materials that can compete with modern packaging material of pulp and paper products.
Now they are gradually displacing organic polymers
Biodegradation of polymer material (biodegradation) according to the standard EN 13432 adopted by EurAsEC is criticized in the standard soil environment for 180 days
As a result of the tests, biopolymers should be converted into carbon dioxide into water and humus
Then the obtained soil cell is passed by no more than 2 mm
Normal value for biopolymer is not more than 10% residue
At the same time, the obtained soil should not contain poisonous elements and heavy metals [2]
To date, chemical production offers 2 solutions for biofuel materials: 1
Biofrequency plant-based polymers
Cleavage with the addition of special biosets to conventional polymers
One of the innovations heated by scientists recently is that the properties of polymer solutions are designed by external (temperature pressure) and internal forces (joints functional groups t
b) change effect failed
To date, polymers have been prepared that can increase or decrease volume under the influence of external force
Such a phenomenon will make a great contribution to the development of medical bioenergy and biotechnology
As a result of mixing hydrogels with spike drugs, they can be in intermolecular bonds, due to the influence of many functional groups, along with the hydrogen bond between them
By gluing drugs included in the hydrogel chain using this property to the patient's body as a paste or material, the drug is able to quickly reach the disease site in proportion to the change in body temperature
After it became known that today, by chemical treatment of cellulosic materials, carboxyl groups are introduced into joints and show stability in a medium of low acidity (pH 1-2), various drug ampoules were prepared on them by the method of administering drugs (capsules) applied to types of diseases
After the drug entering such a capsule survived in the human body, with an increase in average acidity, the properties of pH 67-74 were revealed, which can reach the place where decomposition is required [3]
In his works A [4] showed that as a result of viscosimetric and spectral methods of checking the mechanism of transmission of alchine polyvinyl alcohol, the nonionic polymer saliva has a hydrogen bond with the alchidine molecule, as well as due to the influence of hydrophobic particles of polyvinyl alcohol on the aqueous solution, they accumulate among themselves in the system (compactization)
It has been studied that alchidine with medicinal properties having a hydrogen bond in the joint of the polymer chain is born from a change in the temperature of the system and the acidity of the medium
Hydrogels (films) insoluble in water or other solvents, micro and nanocomposites
Since these polymers have high pump mechanical properties, sensitive to electric or magnetic fields, to the pH of the solution temperature, therefore their application in the field of medicine and biotechnology has great potential
In this regard, radical copolymerization of hydrophilic (AA) acrylamide and hydrophobic (MMA) monomers of methyl methacrylate was carried out at the Department of High Molecular Chemistry at the Kazakh National University named after al-Farabi in order to improve the technology of producing heat-sensitive water-soluble polymers.
In the future, work continues on the introduction into operation of conformational configuration structures of the obtained polymers with the determination of their physicochemical properties.
Demand for polymer clay jewelry grows every day
Polymeric alumina (including plastic) - a flexible material that freezes in the air or when heated based on polyvinyl chloride (small products of doll decoration)
Main methods of producing high molecular weight compounds - polycondensation and polymerization reactions
In polycondensation reactions, as a rule, coffunctional (bifunctional) or multifunctional monomers are involved.
They combine when interacting with each other with the release of a simple small-molecule substance (most often water)
Increases their beam strength and temperature by "stitching" polymer chains
For example, after "cross-linking" the emollient polyethylene chain at 110-130 C with radiation, it will be suitable for long-term use in insulation of wiring at 150-200 C.
There are three different methods for the fusion of low molecular weight monomers into high molecular weight polymer molecules:
by breaking the multiple bond of saturated hydrocarbons or opening closed chains;
formation of an ether bond - due to C - O - C -;
formation of amide bonds through functional groups - C - N - due to
Using the functional groups (= ≡ -NH2 -COOH -NH -OH) in the composition of small molecular compounds by their polymerization by polycondensation and chemical treatment of known polymer substances obtained on their basis, to date, new molecular substances with many chain branches are obtained

At many sports competitions, athletes currently use various additional forces
Proposed work is intended for analysis of steroidal compounds in human urine by chromatographic mass spectrometry of gas
Due to the fact that the known methods still have limited capabilities, it is very important to use in determining the minimum amount of the test substance due to the high sensitivity of the MS method.
Minimum amount of urine with prohibited metabolites of dehydrochloromethyl testosterone (2 ml) is taken for analysis.
Therefore, when determining dehydrochloromethyl testosterone, it was shown that metabolites formed in the human body can be detected by chromatography of mass spectrometric gas detectors
The most effective in this method is its high sensitivity to selectivity, correctness of results and automated frequency
The chemical composition of urine is very complex: it includes the urea of ketones of the amino acid creatinine hippuric acid of many cations and anions of other substances
Therefore, to remove the matrix, it is necessary to prepare a sample in advance
Preliminary preparation of a sample for the determination of anabolic compounds also plays a major role.
Preliminary preparation of metabolite samples of dehydrochloromethyl testosterone and data from mass-spectral and gas-chromatographic studies
Reference words: anabolic steroids dehydrochloromethyl testosterone metabolites mass spectrometric detector gas chromatography biological sample
Recently, among athletes, the use of boosting forces of substances is often observed
These substances: anabolic steroids -clenobutorol 19-norandrosterone epimetendiol and dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (DHCMT) and its metabolites 4-chloro-17 -methyl-5-androsten- 3 1617 -triol () 4-
One such substance is dehydrochloromethyl testosterone (C20H27ClO2; DGCMT) its distinctive feature - quickly excreted from the human body
The certainty limit of DGCMT 1-2 ng/ml is therefore effective using the mass spectrometric detection gas chromatographic method (GC/MS)
This method is widely used in the analysis of multicomponent compounds and its specificity - sensitivity
allows to determine a very small amount of the test substance and analyze substances with molecular weight from 1 to 1· 106
Purpose of the study: determination of DGCMT metabolites by GC/MS method
Dehydrochloromethyl testosterone in the human body is converted into various compounds from the course of metabolic processes (Figure 1)

Form of study - urine isolated from the athlete's body
In humans, the indicator pH 56 -62 is usually weak [3]
96% of urine is water 4% - dry matter (proportion of organic compounds 25% mineral substances - 15%)
The chemical composition of urea is very complex, it includes cations with hippuric acid creatinine amino acids of urea ketones (K + Na + Ca2 +

Chromatogram of urine isolated from the human body
Practical section
Chromatography of mass-selective detectors produced chromatograms of test samples using Agilent Technologies 6890 N Network GC Systemhromatograp
During operation, the following devices and reagents were used:
HPLS Fractionation Unit (Agilent 1100)
analytical scales (METLER TOLEDO)
Reagents: 08 M phosphate buffer pH = 700 20% carbonate buffer pH = 95 NaHCO3/K2CO3 (1:1) hydrolysis enzyme of internal standard solution (β -glucoronidase) - E
helium 99995% "Isblik" (Ukraine) dehydrochloromethyl testosterone - C20H27ClO2 (4-chloro-17 β-hydroxy-17 α-methylandrost-14-diene-3-one) ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) polysorb-10
Sample Pre-Preparation: For HPLS fractionation, a 200 ml urine set is placed in an SPE cartridge
The cartridge was leached first with 50 ml water and then with 4 ml methanol by decantation.
The sample was dried at 500 C with 750 μl phosphate buffer solution (08M pH 70) added thereto, and after 25 μl -glyukuronidazany was added, it was stirred quickly and placed in a thermostat (550C 60 minutes).
After completion of hydrolysis, a buffer mixture is added in a ratio of 1:1 (pH = 90-95) potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate 300 μl 20%
Extraction hydrolysis products with tert-butyl methyl ether 50 ml
The system prepared for this is stirred on a shaker for 5 minutes, after which the organic ether layer is separated at a rate of 2000 rpm/minutunacentrifugan and dried by vacuum in a rotary evaporator at 500 ° C temperature.
Next, a derivative agent (MSTFA/ammonium iodide/ethanethiol in a ratio of 100 vol/m/volume) 1000:2:3 is added to the dry residue cooled for the derivatization process and the samples are kept in a thermostat at 600 ° C for 30 minutes.
The sample tubes are then cooled to room temperature and replaced with 15 mL vials (Agilent Technologies USA - 250 μl) for gas chromatograph analysis.
Discussion of results
DGCMT metabolites were examined from biological sample using mass-selective gas chromatography method
To determine metabolites of DGCMT from urinary sample by method of mass-selective gas chromatography (GC/MS) chromatograms of its metabolites and blank urine are obtained
The analysed gas chromatograph parameters for DGCMT determination are given in Table 1:
Table 1 - GX/MS Device Test Parameters
The obtained data after chromatograms and chromatographic studies are given in Figure 3 and Table 2
In the presented images, the vertices of DGCMT metabolites are visible more intensively than the vertices of blank urine
Urine sample with DGCMT metabolites also clearly indicates the time of retention of the apex (RT min), and no such values are observed at the form (Figure 3)
It can also be proved that DGCMT metabolites are contained in urine with full application of the GC/MS test preparation technique.
Fractionation time of DGCMT metabolites was 15-16 16-18 minutes
Table 2 - Information from mass spectral and chromatographic studies of DGCMT metabolites
Figure 3
Chromatograms of metabolites of barzar and blank urine
These data showed that it is possible to determine the qualitative and quantitative amount of anabolic compounds under athletes using the method of gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detectors
Previously, metabolites of epimetendiol were identified by gas chromatography (GC/MS/MS) with two-quadrupole mass spectrometric detectors [4]
It is known that the selectivity and sensitivity of the GX/MS/MS method in determining anabolic compounds will be higher than that of the mass-selective gas chromatography (GX/MS) method.
However, it has been shown that metabolites of anabolic compounds are determined by the GX/MS method.
Preliminary preparation of a sample for the determination of anabolic compounds also plays a major role.
It should be noted that depending on the complex composition of urine and its diversity, analysis of anabolic steroids on biological objects by GC/MS GC/MS/MS requires special methods for preparing samples

The article describes the issues of mastering courses of special professional disciplines for the training of high-class specialists, including on the technology of rare elements, and their interface with practice
The Republic is rich in raw materials of non-ferrous and rare metals
In the modern world, they are widely used in various industries of science and technology
Therefore, the release of as many valuable components as possible in the feedstock is a very important and complex issue.
As a solution to the problem, there are high expectations for the future of such proposals as the creation of existing second-cycle industries, where the integrated processing of raw materials can use waste from one production, the assembly of residual or insufficient technological schemes
Of course, the only specialist is a chemist-technician who will implement these proposals
It should contribute to the improvement of technological schemes, focusing on additional research on the above issues, successfully combining the knowledge gained during training with experience
To this end, the Kazakh National University named after Al-Farabi is doing a lot of work to develop these skills to future technologists by training special subjects and consolidating the experience of the acquired skills in competence.
Basic curriculum technological processing of raw materials competence elective subject of innovative technologies
In modern conditions, the requirements for specialists conducting chemical analysis in research and production laboratories are tightened, the reason for which is associated with an increase in the volume of the studied area for updating the used brand of technical equipment and increased requirements for the reliability of the analysis results
Therefore, in order to train high-quality specialists, it is necessary to thoroughly teach the subjects of a course of special professional direction, including the field of rare element technology, to monitor their close interaction with practice
The Republic of Kazakhstan is one of the leading producers of non-ferrous and rare metals, as well as many other valuable minerals
According to the plan, a program is being implemented to further increase raw materials support for the fast-growing mining industry
However, at present, a third of the total mass of mined ore in Kazakhstan has been lost, and more than 50% is depreciated as a result of large production of free rocks during processing of deposits
One of the main areas of solution of issues of complex use of raw materials is identification and implementation of systems and the most suitable methods of field processing; preparation and implementation of process schemes for processing mineral raw materials, which allow to fully isolate useful components in the composition of raw materials
Special attention is paid to the development of new technological processes in the organization of production without waste of high technical and economic indicators
One of the directions of Kazakhstan-2050 Strategy development is to increase the efficiency of obtaining products from natural sectors in the direction of innovative industrialization
They are the advantage of our real competitiveness, that is, new directions for the production and processing of raw materials while maintaining the export potential of the oil and gas sector [1]
It is necessary to solve the issues of production of rare Earth metals, which are part of communications and medical devices, which make a great contribution to the development of science, that is, widely used in electronics in laser technology
In this regard, the purpose of the article is to show the importance of laboratory work for professional subjects and determine the specifics of production experience
Chemical technology - science of methods and processes of chemical processing of raw materials and its intermediate products
All processes carried out to obtain substances or compounds by treatment, regardless of their variety, are combined into several groups: chemical hydromechanical thermal masses and mechanical processes, and all of them use similar devices
Chemical technology is widely used in all industries and technologies
Including chemical production has a complex structure and all these processes are often found in it.
Therefore, every year the requirements for specialists engaged in chemical production are tightened
The field of application of the specialty of a chemist-technologist is wide and its knowledge should be comprehensive
It should be able to distinguish between methods of producing substances and compounds and chemical physicochemical methods of their detection [2]
Trained specialists can work in scientific centers and research laboratories in various industrial enterprises
Their task is to know how to prepare new compounds
In the training of specialists, education universities prepare a teaching and methodological complex of each specialty according to the credit technology training system [3]
It combines organized modular curricula that are convenient for education, mainly in the following groups: a general mandatory module - a system of basic disciplines that provides general competence without direct connection with the profession; mandatory module in the specialty - the basic and specialized system of disciplines, the fundamental specialty that ensures professional competence; selection module for a special specialty - a system of specialized individual disciplines that provides competence in the field of specialty; non-qualification selection module (specialty) - a system of means of providing additional competence that does not belong to the specialty (foreign language of information technology)
The competence lies in the fact that the competitiveness of each student is to be able to accept new knowledge and apply it in practice, that is, to be ready for action due to the abilities of each individual student through education.
Elitist or subject of choice (translated from Latin - chosen) - a subject that improves professional education
The elective subject chosen by the student during the course of study must be studied and, depending on the specialty of the student, must have the skills to fulfill the experience of qualification in a certain territory.
The purpose of professional disciplines is to study modern methods used to control the quality of finished products, and to organize analytical control in the laboratories of the plant to consider general issues
Tasks - intermediate and final production products (ores minerals fluxes slag metals and ingots) deepening of knowledge about the properties of chemical elements and their compounds that are part of raw materials; - study of the main methods of analysis widely used in the production of modern mineral raw materials and in metallurgical enterprises; - familiarization with the methods of preparation and preliminary sampling of samples used in the analysis of mineral raw materials; - consideration of the organization of automated systems of analytical control of production; formation of the student's ability to make a specific choice at the end of training by forming professional qualifications and abilities for successful work in the selected territory
To perform any chemical analysis, the researcher, planning the experience and being able to organize the stages of research, draws attention to the following factors related to it: - the chemical composition of the sample under study; - the coverage of the laboratory with the necessary equipment; - the presence of appropriate reagents; - the number of samples under study; - the analysis depending on the required accuracy
However, it is impossible to give a general recipe for performing the analysis method: the analysis executor should have a wide field of view on chemistry and he should know the limitations and advantages of the method
Currently, the issue of integrated use of raw materials has been raised to the level of state technical policy
It is also necessary to solve a number of complex scientific and technical problems: to test new technological processes; replacement of obsolete installations
To ensure the success of these tasks, it is necessary to accelerate the introduction into production of the results that increase the efficiency of scientific and design research
At our department at the Department of Analytical Colloidal Chemistry and Technology of Rare Elements of the Kazakh National University named after Al-Farabi, students with two individual educational trajectories
Studying in the modules "Chemistry and technology of rare elements" and "Electrochemical technology of inorganic substances"
Special professional guides for students of the department, corresponding to the first type of this module, contain several selected disciplines, including "Analytical control in mineral processing" and "Methods of distribution and concentration in analytical chemistry," covered by the organization of laboratory work of cadets and facilitating students as future specialists:
sampling and pre-preparation of the sample;
structural analysis of sample composition;
ways of converting the sample into solution;
separation and concentration of the sample;
analysis of the sample by various chemical physicochemical methods;
performing control according to state standards;
ability to prepare standard solutions;
the ability to organize laboratory work in accordance with state documents;
be able to metrologically process the obtained research results and develop them in accordance with regulatory documents
Thus, for disciplines of a special professional course in the specialty of chemical technology [4], the prospect of organizing laboratory work along with the development of analytical chemistry should be carried out in the following direction:
large-scale transition from laboratory analysis of analysis "at the same place" to analysis on the location of the investigated object;
- reduction of number of aliquot devices required for analysis - continuous trend of analytical chemistry development;
using the theory of type recognition by artificial neural networks through an analytical feature of complete recognition of samples instead of component analysis, as well as a device consisting of reusable gas sensors processed using modern mathematical techniques;
Automation of automation and computerization is distributed in the analytical cycle as a whole, processing the results of analysis of sorting measurements of samples in a certain type of their output, etc.
covers all of this
Computerization allows analysis to come up with completely new fundamental directions;
comparison of analytical reactions with the effect of amplifying ufizic planes on the direction of the chemical process with the effect of ultrasound and radioactive radiation;
in this type of real analysis and other "non-standard" tasks, you can determine in which state the component is contained

Summary
Sorption of platinum gold and paladium with coconut activated carbon in sulphate solution
Effect of platinum gold with coconut asset and pH on paladium sorption was investigated
The specific surface of this sorbent has a large number of meso- and macro-prognoses with a well-developed surface
They react with basic oxides on the surface of the sorbent with acid introduced in an acidic medium.
The smaller the acid in the solution, the stronger the acidity of the aqueous phase and the significant reduction in metal release
Conditions of quantitative distribution of metals: Pd i Au - pH = 17; Pt - pH = 22
Gold platinum and paladium identified in TRE
Gold platinum and paladium can be determined in the presence of copper zinc and iron with active coconut charcoal
No analysis procedure can be provided without process identification
Because it took some time to quantify coconut with active coal into gold-platinum and paladium sorbations
It has been found that platinum gold and paladium can be isolated from the process solution by coconut active coal.

The processing of alternative sources of rare metals, in particular the content of catalysts that act as an accelerator in the process of oil processing, is from 3 to 10% rhenium, therefore the release of rhenium is an urgent issue
The theoretical and applied importance of studying the electrochemical properties of rhenium has not yet been fully studied
In the work, the electrochemical state of perrhenate ions on a nickel electrode in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide without water was investigated by the voltampere method
Electrode potential of cathodic material and influence of electrolyte solution concentration on rhenium release process are revealed
Oxidation of perrhenate ions occurred at -05 V
Increase of electrochemical oxidation waves of perrenate ions with increase of potential transfer rate is shown
In the cathode region of the potential, waves are determined in accordance with the electrotraction process of perrhenate ions
The presence of rhenium in electrolysis products using electron microscopes and X-ray spectral analysis methods has been proved
The only key issue in the metallurgical industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan is the expansion of waste processing in industry
Researchers in recent years have paid attention to rhenium as a promising metal
World-famous copper deposit Zhezkazgan - is currently the main rhenium deposit in Kazakhstan
Due to the activation of an oxidized species in air, rhenium is unstable and difficult to oxidize in an aqueous medium
The only way to solve this problem is to use anhydrous organic electrolyte solutions.
Experience Department
Electrochemical oxidation of rhenium was investigated in three electrode cells at a potential IPC-Pro M plant by lowering voltamper curves
The potential of IPC-Pro M is based on a high-quality operator amplifier connected to a personal computer and controlled by a microprocessor
Auxiliary electrode services were performed by platinum plates, and the relative role of the electrode was a chlorine-silver electrode saturated with lithium chloride solution.
Platinum electrode used as working electrode
Prior to the release of the polarization curve, the electrode surface was constantly washed with distilled water and the surface was cleaned with torpedo paper.
The cell was washed before practice with a hot soda solution in a large amount of flowing, then distilled water, and then dried in vacuo.
Before the experiment, the cell was washed directly with the working solution
Polarization measurements were performed in potential static mode at IPC-pro potential plant
To purify the feed from water (DMSO), the dryer was replaced twice with freshly heated calcium oxide for two weeks and carefully drained from the residue in a dry inert box
After decantation, it was pumped twice in vacuum (pressure 3-5 mm)
) calcium oxide of "h" grade is pre-cleaned by heating in dry air current at temperature 1000 0С
In the experiment "hch" and "h"
"" grade reagents are used
All solutions are made in a box with drying of a bulb with plugs
To absorb atmospheric air, the box was dried with phosphorus bestot and regularly transferred
Salt samples were taken in separate solvent vapor free boxes
Presence of water in all electrolytes after fabrication is checked by presence of OH group signal in IR spectroscopy
Result and discussion
High chemical activity of metallic rhenium ensures its stability only if there is a corrosion retarding coating on the surface
Therefore, rhenium cannot be isolated on the surface without forming a shell that excludes its action by an electrolyte
Thus, the structure of this shell determines the stability of refractory rhenium in its conductivity and solubility in the electrolyte
So
the potential for the release of parallel rhenium is more lost than the oxidation potential of many solvents, which means that in electrolysing, the solvent decomposition reaction with the release of rhenium can also take place
This decomposition is accompanied by the passivity of the electrode surface
A passive shell is formed in the electrode before the metal division potential, and metal ions under certain conditions can move along the discharge in the electrode
In these cases, the passive cladding protects the released metal from electrolyte
One of the conditions for the isolation of the known metal from the literature is the low electronic and upper ionic conductivity of the layer
Cathodic division of rhenium was carried out on a solid platinum electrode
First investigated the electrochemical distribution of rhenium in an anhydrous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide in a platinum electrode
Figure 1 shows the polarization curve of oxidation of perrenate ions in solution 01 n at a transmission rate of different potential
An increase in current with an increase in the potential transfer rate can be observed by an increase in potential
The same pattern was observed in the solution of perrhenate 03 n (10 20 50 100 mV/s) Since with the rapid removal of polarization curves of rhenium, a constant shell cannot form, then the interval can form a low rhenium oxide
At the same time, in the presence of several waves, oxidized products of dimethyl sulfoxide can form on the surface of the electrode:
() + () - - + MV
The polymer shell can be formed by polymerization by a radical mechanism, and the anion can continue to disintegrate:
Figure 3 concludes that at this concentration there is a dissolution of products formed on the cathode surface on the same wave in the polarization curve of the anode oxidation at the same potential transmission rates

Using a nickel web NH4ReO4 (rhenium electrolysis was carried out in a solution of background DMSO
4 - micro photographs and spectra shown in the figures are taken from a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
The image shows that the surface sheath formed as a result of cathodic polarization is not in a uniform structure
White and black spots formed on the surface of the post-electrolysis pad prove the presence of sulfur along with rhenium oxide, and black scales along with rhenium powder may suggest sulfur
Figure 4 - X-ray spectra of products after electrochemical oxidation on ammonium perrenate nickel pad in DMSO solution
Thus, it has become known that in cathodic polarization, the electrode has a non-uniform shell structure in structure and composition.
It was revealed that with an increase in the transmission rate of the potential, electrochemical oxidation of perrhenate ions in a dimethyl sulfoxide solution occurs
Revealed waves in accordance with the release of oxidation products of perrenate ions

Summary
Botanical-geographical connections of the flora of the lower bands of the mountain ranges of the Northern Tien Shan
To analyze the botanical-geographical connection of the flora of the lower mountains of the mountain range with Ketpen, it is necessary, first of all, to describe the location of the studied area inside natural floric units
The lower mountains of the Ketpen mountain range according to the floristic zoning of the lands proposed by Takhtajyan, the Royal Branch of the Ancient Mediterranean of the Holarctic Kingdom of Iran-Turan Region belongs to the Dzungar-Tianshan Province of Central Asia
According to the botanical and geographical zoning of Kazakhstan and Central Asia within the Rachkov region, the lower belt of the Ketpen ridge belongs to the branch of the Kungei Terskey-Ketpen-Yuzhny-Zhongar province
To compare flora, you need not only to get equal territories, but also to get equal flora
We have identified the botanical and geographical links of the Ketpen mountain range with nearby regions (eastern part of the Alatau Alatau of the Kyrgyz Alatau)
To determine the degree of floric relationship of the studied zone with comparable zones, we used the Jacquard method - a coefficient that can serve as an indicator of floric identity
Analysis of floric connections showed that the lower belt of Mount Ketpen is very closely related to the eastern part of Alatau Kungei (-041), close in geography and climate (-039) and Alatau (-037) beyond Ilie
The most distant floric connections were observed in comparison with the Kyrgyz Alatat (-032) flora of the lower belt of Mount Ketpen, which is associated with various climatic and orographic conditions, as well as insufficient study of Kyrgyz Alatau
To determine the specific pathways and time of species formation, the next relatives underwent a geographical-genetic analysis of Zygophyllum Allium Veronica Taraxacum Caragana Potitilla Carax Euphorbia
The aforementioned geological-genetic analysis of polymorphic relatives showed that in the flora of the lower mountains of Mount Ketpen, allochthonic elements from the outside dominate the autochthons

Summary
Plants - dolans blood-red (Crataegus sanguinea P)
) mountain bird (Polygonum aviculare L
) garden medicine (Taraxacum officinale W
) - the effect of man-made pollution on dust conditions was investigated
The highways of Almaty were taken as dust collection places: the first point is Abay Lane and Abylay Khan; the second point is the intersection of Pushkin and Mametova streets; third point - walk of 28 guards
The result showed a variety of plant responses, that is, morphological changes occurred in the structure of dust, reflecting teratological fluctuations, and fluctuations in the level of infertility
Levels of infertility and normal dust development showed differences in the accumulation of hydrocarbons - starch
Fully high-quality grains showed a variety of violet-blue colors, and barren grains remained colorless; and artistic and weak colors are classified as full-fledged cultures
Due to dust deviations, the following groups were identified: the occurrence of asymmetric cereals under the influence of the aperture mechanism of the predominance of the upper layer of sporoderma; species of invertebrates - frequent ovation of Turks in most cases and emptiness of grain; deviations of dust thresholds, however, they were identified - analysis failed in accordance with strong changes in morphological features; massula, that is, a change in the sporoderm in the group arrangement of dust welders
Studies of morphological signs of dust suggest that the plants studied can resist technogenic pollution, creating various obstacles
Plants - garden medicines (Taraxacum officinale W.
) and heat (Artemisia vulgaris L
) use them as indicators in biomonitoring urbanized zones

Summary
Indicators of freshwater reservoirs of Almaty region
This article provides for assessment of pollution of fresh water system of Almaty region by certain indicators
The ecological state of the aquatic environment can also be used to biologically indicate the water quality of a group of organisms in reservoirs: planktonic and benthic invertebrates, honey macrophytes of bacteria and fish
Physical form of research Water sources of Rayymbek district of Almaty region: Shelek Tekes Big Kakpak river basins are lakes of Orikta and Buzumbai
Fresh water belonging to the Teriskei Alatau system is considered very clean
But this opinion requires additional research
Bioindication is based on the close connection of all known living organisms with a viable environment
The change in this position leads to the disappearance of known species of organisms sensitive to this indicator, for example, an increase in the density or pH of water, and the appearance of others for which this medium is optimal
Plants and animals with a variety of bioindications may be used to determine the toxicity of natural waters
Bionidication is divided into sensitive and cumulative according to the type of response
Sensitive bioindicators experience stress with abnormalities outside life forms, and cumulative natural normal effects accumulate inconspicuous changes
For biomonitoring of water bodies, indicators of the first type are most often used
In a future study, representatives of the crustacean family (river crustaceans) (bakhtah) were taken for the main indicator species (infusory daphnia)
We isolated sensitive fast-feeling bioindicators for branched mustachioed crustaceans (Daphnia magna) and smooth-tailed infusory (Paramecium caudatum)
Long-term bioindicators are crustaceans (Astacus fluviatilis) and a member of the rope fish family (Parasalmo mykiss)
We propose a reconnaissance assessment of the degree of water pollution by the composition of hydrobionts based on the basis of a review of types of indicators sensitive to the ecological state of waters
It is also possible to determine the degree and nature of pollution of the sanitary state of water and to quantify the progress of the natural process of self-cleaning of its distribution in water.

This article describes the development and prospects of ecotourism in the middle and lower reaches of the Ili River
An assessment of the ecotouristic capabilities of facilities in the Ili river basin will be made and ways of its development in the future will be proposed
The Ili River originates in Tian Shan and flows into the western part of Lake Balkhash, and at the beginning flows with a mountain river in the lower reaches along the flat steppe
Due to the fact that Eli is a large river, its territory is also vast
From its coast you can see desert-desert lands, sandy hills, swampy pastures, dense ponds and reed zones
Natural and cultural and historical sites located in the floodplain of the Ili River contribute to the development of active tourism
First of all, it will include mountaineering and trekking horse tourism, cycling, auto and motor tourism, pilgrimage tourism, as well as extreme and mixed tourism
In the pond of the Ili River there are all opportunities for the development of environmental tourism
The main goal of the development of ecotourism on the Ile River is to reduce the harmful impact on the environment
Therefore, tours and routes leading to facilities along the Or River should be ecological
For the proper formation and development of ecotourism there it is necessary to take tourists by ecological transport and feed them with clean and useful ecological meals so that qualified guides are interesting and environmentally friendly natural and cultural landscapes
In such ecological places, even garbage should be treated ecotechnologically, without being thrown into common boxes
Ignite during fire only in special places
Mushrooms fruit-berry floral medicinal plants and other natural relics should be obtained only in permitted places
The development of ecotourism along the Ili River is important for the country
Because it opens the way to solving many issues
Ecotourism will constantly develop in Kazakhstan, and in the future a person will benefit each other without harming nature
This information will be discussed in detail in the article
Ecological culture Ecological route Future of ecological tourism Berding Tourism development
Large megacities move away from nature over time due to the peculiarities of life
People living in such cities tend to loneliness away from society, as a result of which an extra load caught in the nerves leads to psychological illness or stress
Therefore, it is clear that the residents of the city, going out into nature, want to relax away from the habits of living in the city alone with nature
Residents of the city, daily suffering from ice due to hard work, travel outside the city at the end of the week to places where there is no purely calm and anthropogenic action: someone climbs the mountain ranges, someone walks inside the forest, and someone rests on the banks of the river and lake [1]
Everyone has the right to rest and spends his vacation so that he likes him
Someone likes to relax on the beach, someone is interested in exotic islands or high mountains, and someone wants to relax lying in front of the TV
For outdoor enthusiasts, the current tourism industry offers various types of recreation
Environmental tourism is one of the most popular tourism industries
Ecotourism in the country is only growing, but every year the demand for it is growing
Environmental tourism is an integral part of natural tourism and, according to the World Tourism Organization, is now a promising industry that contributes to the development of the economy
The emergence of the term "ecological tourism" occurs not only as a result of environmental protection, but also as a result of recreation in a mountain sanatorium caused by the process of increasing environmental education and consciousness.
Under these conditions, ecotourism is the main instrument of sustainable development, it meets the requirements of social justice, serving current and future generations, and is effective in economic planning [2]
When choosing a vacation country, tourists primarily look at the geographical features of this country at the level of infrastructure development and security
The location of Kazakhstan in the center of Eurasia is the advantage of our country, plus all the reliefs of the Earth on Earth
you can find a form from the land of Kazakhstan
On the land of the republic there are high-rise stairs of the entire relief from the plains to the high mountains
In this regard, according to the results of studies and surveys conducted by Germany and Great Britain in France, South Korea and Japanese countries (about 10,000 samples), a high interest in Kazakhstan environmental tours among foreign citizens was revealed.
142 million residents of Europe and Asia showed great interest in Kazakhstan as tourist sites
The number of tourists who arrived in Kazakhstan for tourism in 2008: 618,732 people - domestic tourism - 1,83,973 people, and the results of the first half of 2009 - 127,414 and 355,488 people
By the way, guests of the country will definitely contribute to the economy of the country [3]
The most interesting thing is that a variety of landscapes are found in the Ili River reservoir
There is an assumption that the name of the Ili River comes from the Mongolian word "Ilansu"
In Kazakh, the word "luminous and luminous" means [4]
The Ili River originates in Tian Shan and flows into the western part of Lake Balkhash
It flows through the flat region in the middle and lower part of the Or, on the source side of which is a mountain river
Strange view of an ancient river floating along Elijah: sandy hills with vast reed zones along the banks of densely populated ponds with desert deserts and water swamp pastures
Ili River Water Massif - a region rich in historical and natural monuments in Kazakhstan
Such natural masterpieces as Sand Sand, the Kapshagai reservoir Tamgalinsky stone petroglyphs on the Sharyn Gora River and the adjacent Sharyn Mountains are represented in this region.
As we see, in the region there are various natural wonders associated with all climatic features
Currently, 1-2-day routes are carried out along the Ili River
Excursions by bus will be organized to see the inscription Tamgala - Stone on the rock
This contributed to the popularization of the river among citizens
Tourists come to the Il River and the Kapshagai reservoir with fish, such as sazan-sudak, aktaban
The mouth of the river is a real mystery dedicated to observing wild birds in nature and lovers of exotic
The most popular and favorite things among foreign tourists who like to relax in nature (English
"berd" means "bird")
This type of tourism is recognized as its sport, since in the process of watching birds the main thing is not to be distracted from their photography
Due to the fact that this type of tourism is known all over the world, it is possible to attract foreign tourists to the Ili River reservoir
From a tourist point of view, the most developed is Lake Balkhash
The lake is distinguished by its scope and unique beauty as the decisive color of the journey to the Ili River
There are a lot of forest islands where you can relax [5]
At the same time, natural and cultural-historical sites located in the floodplain of the Ili River contribute to the development of active tourism
First of all, it will include mountaineering and trekking horse tourism, cycling, auto and motor tourism, pilgrimage tourism, as well as extreme and mixed tourism
Development of mountain waters will allow to develop water tourism
Water tourism is the most environmentally friendly of the types of tourism
Sharyn Shelek Koksu Lepsi Karatal rivers are very convenient for experienced water athletes
The headwaters of these rivers are located in zones rich in natural landscapes and without human feet [6]
This water mass of the Ili River will allow you to use all types of rafting
The most interesting route inside is the route from Kapshagayskaya hydroelectric station to the city of Bakanas (duration: 7 days (6 nights) of parking: hotels like tents: minibus) from Kapshagayskaya hydroelectric station to Tasmuryn Canal
The plant and animal world of the Altynemel National Park, located in the watershed of the Ili River, has been identified in different places about 6 thousand plant species and 300 species of vertebrate animals
Altynemel National Park is one of the first parks in Kazakhstan that form hunting tourism and attract hunter tourists in the world
For this, the park will provide hunters with various hunting grounds and various animals
Including Siberian mountain goat Siberian from wild boars of wolf ungulates
The number of wild animals and birds in the park is significantly higher due to the round-the-clock patrol of guards, which allows the development of hunting tourism
As we said, in the Ili river basin there are all the opportunities for the development of environmental tourism
The main goal of the development of ecotourism on the Ile River is to reduce the harmful impact on the environment
In some cases, harmful effects are observed from the actions of tourists who are poorly organized
Their preliminary unorganized routes cause concern among animals, especially since garbage does not remain asleep in resting places
Due to the fact that ecotourism is one of the areas of tourism in which people relax with a natural stop, the views and routes leading to objects along the Ili River should also be ecological
For the correct formation and development of ecotourism, tourists are exported there by environmental transport
with food (local food) qualified guides are interesting and environmentally friendly natural and cultural landscapes
In such ecological places, even garbage should be treated ecotechnologically, without being thrown into common boxes
Ignite during fire only in special places
Fungi fruit-berry floral medicinal plants and other natural relics should be used only in permitted places
Hotel for tourist parking should be built so that camping does not damage the landscape around the tents
It is not allowed that the hotel and campsites are built of harmless materials and deprive their residents of energy and water
In order for such an excellent nature to be preserved in this state for future generations, it is necessary to strictly observe the basic conditions above, reducing nature from the influence of anthropogenic factors [7]
The development of ecotourism along the Ili River is important for the country
Because it opens the way to solving many issues
If ecotourism is constantly developing in Kazakhstan, then without prejudice to the future nature, they will benefit each other: local residents will be provided with work as services, contributing to the stable earnings of workers, which, in turn, will improve the living conditions of the local population, will increase the work of local residents engaged in some traditional industries, and tourists will become more familiar with the culture of the Kazakh people and respect the traditions of the local population
There is no harm to nature, on the contrary, beauty protected from anthropogenic actions [8]
In some countries, ecotourism is not only a large tourism sector, but also an economic sector, in the following countries it is a special area of ​ ​ conservation
Ecotourism in our country has just begun to be recognized
Environmental tourism is an important source of income from nature conservation
So, payment for environmental management - payment for hunting trophies for the use of transport; obtaining rent for the services of transport guides for temporary stopping of meals; Interest on the sale of local goods to tourists arriving in the territory provided; taxation of goods [9]
Development of domestic tourism is one of the priority projects of the Government of Kazakhstan, because tourism and travel are one of the leading export sectors
Ecotourism in Kazakhstan is a developing industry, but now you can feel the positive effect
Kazakhstan can be compared with a tourist diamond, because its excellent tourist opportunities, corresponding to world competition, are looking forward to their moment

This article examines soil and microflora changes in the landing zone of launch vehicles
Kasmodrom "Baikonur," located in the Republic of Kazakhstan, has a world-class appreciation
The cosmodrome has some goals, that is, space exploration will be phased in with Russia, as it rents Proton for launch
During the launch of the rocket, some parts of the launch vehicles fall on the territory of Kazakhstan
Rocket fuel used for rocket flight, heptyl or bimethyl hydrazine (BEMG) non-symmetric
This toxicant belongs to the first class of danger of humans, has a very strong carcinogenic and mutagenic effect
For the purposes of the work, a study of the ground condition of the landing area of ​ ​ the launch vehicle and soil microflora in which toxic non-symmetric two methylhydrazines were spilled
To study the soil of the landing zone of the launch vehicle, a certain territory was obtained
It has the name "KA 15 25" (collapse area) and 50-52 km southwest of s. Karsakpay, Ulytau district, Karaganda region of the Republic of Kazakhstan
On the territory are the right bank of the Kalmakkurgan basin and the middle part of the Dusembay basin
Soil-microbiological methods applied in the study
Land landscape "KA 1525" comes to man-made pollution with maximum self-cleaning in various ways
The surface surfaces of the soil are exposed to heat, and unnecessary substances from technogen accumulate man-made elements into the soil, which eliminates soil fertility and changes the pH environment
Changes the soil structure
When the soil structure changes, it loses the ability to maintain moisture, that is, the regime of urgent air and soil water changes

Introduction
The Baikonur Cosmodrome, located in the Republic of Kazakhstan, has a world-class appreciation
The cosmodrome has some goals, that is, space exploration will be phased in with Russia, as it rents Proton for launch
Mentioned cooperation will strengthen scientific and technological progress of Kazakhstan in this area
However, the negative effects of rocket and space technology lead to long-term satisfaction: when the natural environment is contaminated with highly toxic rocket fuel during launch into orbit, the first rocket waste contaminates the surface of rocket fuel
The toxicity of rocket fuel is determined from one of its components:
BEMG is very dangerous for humans, i.e. belongs to the first hazard class, very carcinogenic and mutagenic [12]
Therefore, the issue of environmental danger (from the flight of the rocket to the fall on the ground) remains a priority
To date, the detoxification of the propellant component (RCC) has been studied by various methods.
These studies include thermal physicochemical and chemical methods [3 4]
However, despite the availability of expensive methods, they provide the necessary level of land and soil, as well as eliminate soil fertility
The purpose of the work: a study of the ground condition of the landing area of ​ ​ the launch vehicle and soil microflora, in which toxic neuronymmetric two methylhydrazines spilled
Task of work:
photography of the territory of the collapsed territory of the launch vehicle;
knowledge of soil ecology;
microbiological study of the soil of the landing area of ​ ​ the launch vehicle
Form and methods of research
For the study of the ZOTA soil, a certain territory was obtained with the name "KA 1525" (collapse area) and 50-52 km southwest of the village. Karsakpay of the Ulytau district of the Karaganda region of the Republic of Kazakhstan
On the territory are the right bank of the Kalmakkurgan basin and the middle part of the Dusembay basin
The territory of ZTK "KA 1525" is a single place "KA 15" and "KA 25," when extended from north to east and from south to west is identical to each other
Area "KA 15 25" is 650 azimuths of large umbilical cord curve
The length of the large landfill "KA 15" is 27 km, and the small - 18 km
"AC 25" - more than 60 km, respectively 30 km
In the center of the alphabet "KA 15" with
66°46'30"; "KA 25" -
66 ° 23 '00 "
For the study of bacteria and fungal insulation, we took soil samples in which the first fragments lie in the fall zone of the launch vehicle contaminated with BEMG
We worked on a method of collecting culture when isolating microorganisms
To accumulate culture, common microorganisms were used in the nutrient medium (EPA), in the Saburo nutrient medium (g/l), micromycetes in the Chapek nutrient medium and entobacteria in the Endo nutrient medium
Soil squeezes (1 gram soil sample of the area under study is ground per 100 ml of sterilized distilled water) are mixed by 01 ml and burned with spatula into solid nutrient medium
Inoculants sown in petri dishes are controlled at a temperature of 28 ° C in the thermostat for 5-7 days
Results and Analyses
Characteristics of the territory "KA 15 25"
The total area of ​ ​ the studied site and adjacent land is 280 thousand hectares.
Part of the territory "ҚA15 25," on which the launch vehicle transferred the place of the fall, that is, the territory of the contaminated species assigned to the study, 1122 thousand.
The territory belongs to the akimat of Karsakpay, and the total territory was temporarily transferred to operation by the missile carriers of the Baikonur cosmodrome
Use of agricultural development land is not limited (table 1)
Table 1 - Area of agricultural development lands on the territory of "KA 15 25" of the village of Karsakpay
Water supply facilities for household use on the territory of "KA 15" and 1 pipeline well for underground water with 4 winter 7 mine wells, and on the territory of "KA 25" 3 wintering 1 strip? The station has 12 mine wells and 1 water well
In an area where the weather on the territory under study has an urgent continent, the urgent continent is sometimes characterized by high thermal flounders, as well as less precipitation
Average annual air temperature + 36
Average annual precipitation + 40 ° - 138 mm
Ecological status of land
The land landscape "KA 15 25" comes to man-made pollution with maximum self-cleaning in various ways
The surface surfaces of the soil are exposed to heat, and unnecessary substances from technogen accumulate man-made elements into the soil, which eliminates soil fertility and changes the pH environment
Changes the soil structure
When the soil structure changes, it loses the ability to maintain moisture, that is, the regime of urgent air and soil water changes
In general, the skeletons of many collapsed ZOTA launch vehicles are assembled, and a very strong geochemical heptyl is poured with deviations of the propellant component
When these launch vehicles fall, the RVC will deploy into the air, the launch vehicle will have a high level of local pollution
Then wind and water on the sides lead to pollution of the secondary regional landscape and spread well to the northeast zone
Research work on R&D is carried out, but in very small volumes, and detoxification of soils is practically not studied
Therefore, the study and restoration of the territory is the main environmental issue of pollution of the area with RCC heptyl
To solve these issues, it is necessary to organize events and carry out technological rehabilitation work to violate the lands of Kazakhstan
Microbiological study of soil in the landing area of ​ ​ the launch vehicle (ZSKM)
Currently, work is underway on microbiological cleaning of ground soils poured with fuel from launch vehicles
First of all, this is little understood in the intrinsic degradation of the process of reactionary susceptibility under biological and biochemical stability in the way of environmental transformation into the nature ecosystem of BEMG [56]
A promising application will be the biological purification of the environment from toxicants by various xenobiotics
It is believed that two non-cymmetric methyl hydrazines have proved the ability of the soil microflora and some microorganisms to dispose of this substance.
Some natural microflora retain viability in each soil sample
For example, sequential units (sequential units in EPB samples) are biodegradated in a BEMG environment (Table 2)
Table 2 - Number of microorganisms of sequential units in soil samples of PTA
Comment: Two different chains have begun to grow in the petri bowl's facial nutrient environment
in 1/6 samples and 1/9 samples of microscopic fungi, as well as in 1/12 samples, they had a smaller number
The number of sequential units (EPBs) in actinobacteria is equal in all research samples
The number of sequential units (EPB) in enterobacteria is much smaller than that given in samples 1/9 i 1/12 (Table 2)
Conclusion: micromycetes isolated, they identified enterobacteria that are resistant to toxicants in bimethyl hydraz

In scientific work, adaptive changes in breathing parameters of the human body under various loads were investigated
The main obtained breathing parameters as indicators by volume and time: duration of breathing and breathing with frequency of lung breathing, volume of breathing and breathing with reserve volume of breathing and breathing, average rate of inspiratory and expiratory breathing, as well as conditions under normal conditions and discomfort conditions of human breathing, as well as respiratory and physical loads under conditions of obstacles and barriers set for breathing
It was shown that the volume and time indicators considered by respiratory patterns undergo significant changes under functional loads
Breathing indices by volume and time in the state of respiratory discomfort as a result of respiratory and physical exertion were studied
The reason for the growth of breathing volume during interference is the influence of proprioreceptive breathing activities, and the reason for the decrease in pulmonary ventilation is breathing fatigue even with calm breathing under the influence of respiratory barriers.
Breathing parameters physical respiratory interference pattern discomfort breathing
Research work has studied breathing rates by volume and time in a state of breathing discomfort as a result of respiratory and physical exertion, which today is one of the most pressing and difficult issues in the field of physiological and medical sciences
The study involved 40 people aged 19 to 21 years
- familiarized with preliminary experimental conditions and trained
The study was conducted in normal breathing condition and after exposure to its additional elastic (resistive) obstacles
Insirat for breathing (during rest) and
compared to the water level in the expiratory (when inhaled) amount of 12 cm sec.
Specifically in recent years, we have studied the respiratory rates of the spirograph and the included respiratory mask: V - minute volume of pulmonary ventilation;
Number of cycles f min - respiratory rate; VC (ml) - lung viability; BT (ml) - breath volume; RVI (ml) - reserve breathing volume; RVE (ml) - reserve breathing volume; TI (s) - breathing duration; TE (sec) - breathing duration; VT/TI (l sec) - Inspirator
average rate of air flow; VT/TE (l sec	) - average flow rate of expirator air
The above physiological parameters were given by pressing the foot pedal 60 times per minute with an increase in load power by 30 W in the interval of each 3-minute interval
In case of breathing discomfort (DDC) arising as a result of such loads, the subject gives a special signal (signal):
if all physiological indicators are available
Research results and analysis
The volume of calm breathing during the supply of inspiratory and expiratory obstacles increases from 610 + 48 to 640 + 55 ml, and the total pulmonary ventilation decreases from 8950 + 360 ml/min to 8620 + 250 ml/min (r < 005)
Influence of proprioreceptive breathing activities may be the cause of breathing volume growth in obstructions, and fatigue even in calm breathing under the influence of respiratory barriers may be the cause of lung ventilation decrease [1-6]
The volume of breathing during the exercise was determined both unhindered and with resistance, i.e. they were respectively 695 + 57 ml and 712 + 63 ml (p < 005)
Therefore, the ventilation of the lungs in the barrier-free state increases significantly under the influence of physical exertion, it reaches 27,800,+,1040 ml/min (p < 005), and with an obstacle it is lower than 23,200,+,1300 ml/min (p < 005)
Reduced ventilation causes breathing fatigue under the influence of physical and respiratory loads
Breathing and breathing when breathing discomfort occurs, both when establishing inspiratory and expiratory obstacles, and when providing calm breathing and physical exertion
in the size of back-up production volumes
RVI - reserve breathing volume at normal breathing 1687 + 127 ml
with inspiratory and expiratory obstacles, it decreases to 1548 + 114 ml
The gas content of arterial blood during light work, that is, the hemoreceptive effect of respiration, as a rule, changes little
Therefore, a sharp increase in ventilation causes neurogenic effects
Neurogenic effects include effects of afferent receptors, most often suprabulbar brain sections emanating from muscles or working tissues [157] The presence of ventilation (ventilation) reactions of humans and animals, supported by many experiments that proprioreceptor receptors in the regulation of respiration during the transfer of physical activity are of particular importance [3]
It is known that the causative agent (drive) of the "muscles" does not respond to the hemoreceptor effect, but cannot be separated from the hemoreceptor effect, since they all serve as a single whole
At the same time, there is an increase in blood circulation, which necessarily supports ventilation-perfusion ratios to increased pulmonary ventilation, or the efficiency of gas distribution in the lungs is reduced [3]
Physical activity increases the rate of breathing, which means that when hindering breathing, the effect of physical activity on the rate of breathing remains lower
The duration of breathing always exceeds the duration of breathing (250 + 027 s and 163 + 028 s), and when setting inspiratory and expiratory obstacles, they, respectively, change (207 + 031 s and 204 + 030 s), and when breathing discomfort caused by the result of physical exertion with the barrier, they decrease from the size in barrier-free calm
With normal free breathing, TE and TI show respectively 095 + 015 sec and 127 + 014 sec (r < 005 and r < 001)
Under the influence of resistive obstacles, these parameters change accordingly 134 + 013 sec and 122 + 007 sec (r < 001)
When placing the inspiratory or expiratory barrier on the respiratory tract in a calm state, the rate of inspiratory flow decreases and the rate of expiratory flows is directed to increase
Physical activity, both with and without barriers, usually increases the pace of these flows, and with breathing discomfort caused by the result of resistive overload, the inspiratory pace decreases significantly, and the expiratory flow does not change
Average rate with calm free breathing of inspiratory and expiratory flows and 051 + 004 l/s with additional interference; 024 + 001 l/s and 045 + 004 l/s; 026 + 002 l/s, and in case of respiratory discomfort - 110 + 005 l/s, respectively; 081 + 007 l/s and 073 + 005 l/s
When breathing discomfort appears in conditions of physical exertion, the changes in these indicators look very significant
As a result of additional external obstacles, pressure on the upper respiratory tract increases, which raises the idea of ​ ​ the high role of receptors in these pathways [8]
But in this regard, information on the role of pulmonary mechanoreceptors has not yet been completely resolved and contradicts [7]
Evidence of significant deviations in breathing rates by volume and time from exposure to isovantilator and stenovantilator changes is fully supported in these studies
It can be seen due to a slowdown of breathing from changes in the respiratory pattern, a decrease in its depth, and a weakening of breathing due to an increase in the volume of its breathing, that is, a change in the depth of breathing and the duration of breathing is inversely proportional to
The basis of the ventilation level stability lies in the relative constant of the size of the average inspiratory flow (BT/TI)
With resistive load, a change in pattern is observed, especially with respiratory discomfort caused by physical and respiratory load
With a constant ratio between the duration of breathing and breathing, the fractions of the volume of inspiratory and expiratory breathing in the breathing cycle are also stable, but the proportion of their ratio varies significantly in accordance with the given load
The increase in breathing volume occurs both in a calm state associated with a reduction in the respiratory phase and during operation, but is enhanced in these cases under inspiratory and expiratory loads
We conclude that thanks to these mechanisms compatibility and optimality (optimality) of breathing indices by volume and time will be realized [9-11]
Therefore, according to the results of the study, it is possible to conduct briefings in the form of scientific and methodological sheets, and we believe that in practice it is possible to come out with practical proposals for the physiology and pathology of the respiratory tract and pulmonology of children and adolescents

In the qualitative assessment of the urbanized zone, physical climatic factors of the location of the city are also taken into account
Almaty is located in one of the largest megacities at sea level
Almaty city is distinguished by its physical, geographical and natural-climatic character
These properties affect its environmental characteristics
Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the density of residential buildings in various buildings
At the same time, a large number of buildings are being built in the southern part of the city, where a stream of mountain air passes.
In fact, previously created environmental projects and a plan for the construction of buildings for the smooth transition of the main air flow from the southern part of the city remain unrealized.
Building symbols are not maintained in water protection and river coastal zones, and some harmful art objects have been transferred from the city, but these issues remain relevant until now
Pollutants enter the environment in various ways
The main of them include gas and dust emissions in production facilities, waste water, household waste disposal sites
Along these routes, a large number of pollutants are exported to the environment
Among them there are high-precision substances
To improve the environmental situation in Almaty, we must take part not only in administrative, but in general.
Of course, first of all we must implement environmental projects
There should be better landscape projects for landscaping and city care
Atmospheric pollution occurred due to an increase in vehicles
And to clean the air, of course, you need to plant more trees
On this day, large structures were built, and the soil was torn off
In the wind, dust in the soil will rise to the ceiling
And in order for dust not to be absorbed into the air, in these places it is necessary to grow species of trees with blue grasses and spruce plantations
Climatic factors, landscape geographic environmental conditions concentration of production emissions, emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere of ecological disaster zones
The city of Almaty is located in the center of the Eurasian continent in the north of Mount Tian-Shan on the slope of the Ili Alatau in the southeast of the Republic of Kazakhstan
In the qualitative assessment of the urbanized zone, physical climatic factors of the location of the city are also taken into account
The city of Almaty is located at an altitude of above sea level in one of the largest megacities
Almaty city is distinguished by its physical, geographical and natural-climatic character
These properties affect its environmental characteristics [1]
Complex landscape geographical conditions have determined the modern planning construction of the city
Most built-up areas are occupied by residential complexes, and one-story buildings occupying a small area are located only in some areas
More than 70% of the production area is located in the central and northern parts of the city
Production and low-rise buildings were built north of Rayymbek Avenue
Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the density of residential buildings in various buildings
At the same time, a large number of buildings are being built in the southern part of the city, where a stream of mountain air passes.
In fact, previously created environmental projects and a plan for the construction of buildings for the smooth transition of the main air flow from the southern part of the city remain unrealized.
Construction symbols are not maintained in water protection and river coastal zones, and although some harmful occupations have been transferred from the city, these issues remain relevant until now [1]
In terms of equipment with rolling stock, urban electric transport lags behind in the development of the route system
The shortcomings made in the road system from the environmental point of view include the absence of a single system movement of main streets and suburban roads and driveways [2]
The concept of development of the Almaty city master plan on preliminary environmental impact assessment includes factors that negatively affect the state of the city environment:
Failure to comply with environmental regulations and the concentration of a large number of production facilities in the central part of the city;
production formation in the structure of the city and the placement of residential buildings in zones with emissions of production are not fully systematized in production;
the weakness or absence of sanitary protection zones and the use of these zones for other urban needs lead to low efficiency of landscaping
The main source of environmental pollution in Almaty territory are cars with production enterprises
These include heat and power plants (1-ZHES 2-ZHES and GRES) and dozens of boiler houses, the production complex of the Book factory AZTM Piston
enterprises
Environmental instability is affected by automotive castings and automotive fuels [3]
Pollutants enter the environment in various ways
The main of them are gas and dust emissions in production facilities - places of domestic disposal of industrial domestic wastewater
Many pollutants are exported to the environment along these routes [13]
Among them are highly toxic substances [3]
The climate of the city changes every day regardless of the time of year from a variable type of temperature
From a 500-meter height, the streets of the city will be oriented north to Kaskelen Moyinkum
In the south of the city, at an altitude of 1500-1700 meters above sea level, a cold glacier of glaciers is felt in the Medeu tract in the rocky zone
Outskirts of Almaty belong to Ili Alatau national park
The city covers 170 square kilometers
Located along the rivers Bolshoi and Maly Almaty
Mountain rivers and lakes provide the city with water
Almaty, which with beautiful beauty will be remembered for a new comfortable gentle nature, today will probably find a warm place in the hearts of each person
And this is Almaty.
But what is the situation with the current Almaty? The city is dynamically developing from year to year
The economic situation with the life of the population is no worse than the process of development of the city
Almaty is also a place of new opportunities
Almaty is a city that has reached great heights
Looking at its history, it has survived several historical periods [4]
If Alatau is met with shouts, Koktnebesi will be furious
The environmental conditions of our city have recently been slowing down
This is one of the zones of environmental disaster
Therefore, every Almaty citizen should not forget about Nature-Mother
This city is one of the largest megacities of modern Kazakh society
It is also distinguished by modern developed buildings
The center of business and competition and the expectation of higher heights in the future is also not surprising
Almaty, based on the results of the control results of Kazhydromet 2013, took the first place with indicator of high level of air pollution inside the cities of Kazakhstan [4]
To date, Almaty is included in the list of 25 polluted cities of the world
According to the city's traffic police, more than 540,000 vehicles are currently registered
Their number will increase to 40 thousand per year
Also, about 200 thousand cars come to the city every day
The nature of the harmful effects of pollutants is diverse: they become poisonous to plants, accelerating the corrosion of various metals, and also become one of the causes of heat, exposing them to mass lungs and other diseases
And from every thousand cars 3,000 kg of carbon oxides per day in the air
c products of incomplete combustion of fuel are isolated [5]
Annually, they add about 280 million tons of carbon monoxide 56 million tons of hydrocarbons to the air 28 million tons of nitrogen oxide
The content of these gases is more than 200 particularly complex substances (Pb Hg Cd t
heavy metals with internal combustion engine gases - benzapyrene aldehydes)
Of these, harmful - harmful hydrogen vapors of nitrogen oxygen - ethylene carbon nitrogen oxide benzene ethylene methane toluene benzene (a) pyrene hydrogen sulfide
It
physicochemical mixtures [56]
particularly harmful to humans and animals in breathing
Pollutants quickly spread into the air when the car is heated and when driving at low speed
When the machine stops, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide, as well as nitric oxide
Diesel motor machines have a big disadvantage than gasoline machines, as they contain CO NO substances
They produce a lot of smoke due to the high harmful effects on human health
It is determined that gases released from transport to the atmosphere contain 25-27% lead and reach 40% of its diameter up to 5 μm
It is known that it was stored for a long time in the air and with it enters the human body
Car smoke has a harmful effect on green spaces - due to dirty air, diseases occur on vegetation
Leaves are chemically burned
Air pollution directly depends on the technical condition of vehicles
According to surveys conducted along city highways, 80% of vehicles in chimneys were 3-4 times higher than the standards of harmful substances
Yes, one of the main factors of atmospheric air pollution is the car
Motor transport contains about 200 substances
Of these, completely burned or burnt hydrocarbons
Flammable hydrocarbons are released as part of the smoke leaving the machine, especially when the transport motor is slow
Annual growth of traffic flows in the city negatively affects the environmental situation, public health and the ecology of the city
Unfortunately, harmful waste from vehicles is not disposed of, since there is no production for their processing
Wastes of poisonous liquids used in transport merge into the ground and harm the soil
Pollution of motor vehicles has increased in recent years
Today, 60% of emissions of harmful substances to the environment in large cities of the country are accounted for by these cars [6]
Emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere from their transport are 507 tons per day
Annual indicator will reach 150-200 thousand tons or 90% of harmful emissions in the air
"Engines of obsolete cars contain more than 170 harmful impurities
For example, the carbon dioxide oxide of 800 kilograms of nitric oxide is 40 kilograms for 1 year.
Among them are more than 20 kg of various carbon dioxide substances, except for those mentioned
Thus, more than 200 harmful substances will enter the environment with transport smoke, "said the director of the department.
According to him, due to the effects of these substances on health, the number of patients with cancer and respiratory tract is increasing
Therefore, implementation of Euro standards is a current issue [6]
It is very difficult to fight poisonous gases leaving cars
Because it is necessary to implement the following measures: a ban on the passage of heavy trucks inside the city, the use of control and regulatory units that keep gasoline exhaust gases in the air, preventing the concentration of several buses on one route, as well as the transfer of all cars and public cars to gas.
To do this, it is necessary to close gas stations inside and outside the city and install gas stations in their place
The use of gas is very profitable, since the air from it is not contaminated, and its use is cheaper
It is profitable to use mainly trolleybuses and metro trams in Almaty
If the unfinished metro in the city worked in the future, then the work of cars in Almaty would significantly improve
Currently, many companies are engaged in landscaping and flowering of all areas of the Republic of Kazakhstan [5]
I think that in order to improve the environmental situation in Almaty, we should take part not only in administrative, but also in general.
Of course, first of all we must implement environmental projects
There should be better landscape projects for landscaping and city care
Atmospheric pollution occurred due to an increase in vehicles
And to clean the air, of course, you need to plant more trees
On this day, large structures were built, and the soil was torn off
In the wind, dust in the soil rises to the ceiling [6]
And in order for dust not to be absorbed into the air, in these places it is necessary to grow species of trees with blue grasses and spruce plantations

Summary
Prevalence of overweight and obesity in indigenous rural populations
The article presents the results of the study of overweight and the spread of obesity in the village of Irgeli, Karasai district, Almaty region (179 people, including 117 women and 62 men) depending on age activity and nutritional quality
In the first phase of the study, the questionnaire conducted a Rose survey that collected data on physical activity and dietary qualities associated with parental inheritance
At the second stage body mass index (DSI) is calculated with measurement of length and weight of growth - ratio of body mass (kg) to length of growth (m2)
The average weight was found in women (63412 ± 972) kg, and in men (71369 ± 1369) kg
No statistically significant differences in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among women and men were observed
Normal body weight DSI = 185- 249 kg/m2 - 464% in females 490% in males, and excess body weight (DSI > 25 kg/m2) is determined in 364% of females 312% of males
However, the prevalence of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) was significant in women - 158%, among men - 85%
In men aged 30 to 39 years, obesity was 33% aged 40-49 and 50-59 years.
One in seven men over 60 years old showed obesity (150%)
Compared to 30-39 years, this figure was quite high in statistics
It is noted that the maximum prevalence of obesity in persons deprived of sex or spouse is 283%
Overweight and obese people among men and women with different household conditions met with uniform frequency
In women in marriage, excess body weight and prevalence of obesity was 238%, in men - 15%
In the population with moderate physical activity 18%, and in the population with low physical activity 218% more body weight and obesity
It was found that in the population with significant overweight disorder and obesity quality, 322% of incidence is stably higher compared to normal people

The article well explains the basic concepts and phenomena of students through deep education and national education of students using the knowledge and concepts of the Kazakh people related to metals in teaching applied chemistry in higher educational institutions
Skillfully observing these concepts and phenomena from everyday life, watching how to extract metals from everyday life from the environment, and how to heat them normally, slow them down, slow them down, pour the molten metal into a special norm, cut another metal into the same metal.
The following scientists speak about miners of Kazakh jewelry masters: Al-Idrysi Herodotus S.
They say Satpaev writes his thoughts
Data on how metals of useful domestic professional significance were extracted from the national historical and cultural heritage of the Kazakh people: gold silver copper tin of lead reinforced concrete zinc and ingots
An article providing that elements of folk pedagogy should be used to teach applied chemistry at universities in order to combine these selected metals with the achievements of modern teaching theory
Smelting smelting smelting production metal training
Items (products) necessary for themselves in the course of life were sought by the child sooner or later
In the Stone Age, man made equipment from stone or horns from giant animal remains
They chose solid species from stones, such as ring edon
Copper and copper ingots were used for copper production equipment in the Bronze Age
In the Iron Age, a large amount of life support equipment was made of iron and iron ingots
Travelers of the ancient world left a lot of information about the Kazakh land
Arab traveler Al-Idrysi writes: "Gold silver copper products produced around Ulytau were sold by Shash (Tashkent) merchants at times along the famous caravans along the Great Silk Road
These goods will be distributed to the West and East in the future, "he said.
"In this country, copper and copper"
They were taken out of the bow like a cannon arrow, but from headdresses and a waist mausoleum to stables
As a result of this, great disasters arose
Underground surface dug on the ground after a close eruption
The deposit is excavated with bone and stone hammer
Subsequently, a method of burning the ore layer appeared
With strong fuel heating, cold water is poured on the ore layer poured here.
Rock layer explodes and disassembles
The mine then collects and fuses the parts
Our ancestors mined ores in different ways:
- ore well found in vertical surface slope;
- produced by an open method to produce ore on the surface of the earth;
- mine lying on the terenga, acted as a well
In the early days, miners consistently made such processes when removing metal from ore
Searching for ore its content grinding cleaning dissolving heating filtration irrigation
metal recovery collection of various wastes
Morning miners with the help of changes in the terrain of the earth could foresee ores in the soil
If the rock contains a green or blue deposit, it was first loosened and loosened in a mountain pit, and then expanded deeper and turned into a large cave (mine)
Miners found an accurate search for land-related deposits
According to Satbaev, the so-called "Thousandth Pit" means that the field was mined early
The name "Karatas" means "Altyntapkan" - gold "Zhezkazgan" - copper with copper "Koktas" with iron
The name "Snake" means that there are non-ferrous metals in this region
According to the legend of the people, snakes guard the land with gold
in the land of Kazakhstan
the tribe "miracle," which lived in the era, was called with mining skill
Today, when studying the modern technique of disasters called the "Miracle Pit," scientists are not neglected
Because the tribes of "miracles" are highly accurate in the composition of dug apans and ore waste
As an example of metalworking of morning mines, let us tell the stone of copper processing Bakyrtau
To produce copper, miners burn in each face
Stone and ore are poured with water on the surface with complete melting
Then the rock gnaws
Water breaks between the light
Cuts ore in parts
If the ore is crushed, it is collected with a long line bucket
In the morning, the miners, sorting by the color of the ore from the face, put copper in a stone pencil and poured powdered saxaul and coal from it, having previously prepared a drip liquid with a special ravine.
To better conduct the beam process, the furnace or ore combustion site was placed at a height under the wind
Later, miners learned about the refractory properties of clay and made dishes from them
The ancient metallurgical center of Zhezkazgan field "Milykudyk" academician K.
Satpaev discovered
In his opinion, the development of ore began in the era of enolyte and became widespread in the zhezkazgan
studying ancient ingots, K
Satpayev here at least 1 million
tons of ore mined and ancient mining miners used 55% copper
It is worth noting that an English specialist who worked in the zhezkazgan at the beginning of the 20th century, S.
Ball received ingots containing 4% copper, which means that it did not reach the level of mining
This is evidenced by bronze copper ingots made with copper metals
Masters and jewelers engaged in metalworking said that our people have special abilities
During the period when the school in the village did not open, the Kazakhs still hold the word "Do not lose courage if you lose your name," which raises and brings the child to professionals
Kazakhs who traded cattle never sold thug men together.
Kazakh word "blacksmith" means "master" "artificial entrepreneurial person"
Usually, among grasshoppers, iron tin and a person engaged in bullion were called "grasshoppers," and non-ferrous metalworkers - "jewelry"
The word "jewelry" means "gold," which has been known in everyday life since early childhood
Jewelry "gold" "silver" "copper," "copper," requiring a high level of excellent skill in working with precious and non-ferrous metals
Wire threads finely covered with metals of this color are called "grain"
From this delicate towel
phrases came to life
Traveling in the Kazakh land, P.
Gaines said
They write: "Kazakhs heat silver in clay plates and heat it on coal, which adores from the root of crushed stone."
The Kazakh people used the following methods of jewelry work:
compression to normal;
heating with fire;
smelting;
drying;
lull;
consideration;
draining the molten metal into a special mold;
dividing the other metal into one metal;
metal surface thread;
gold plated on metals;
metal spraying by welding;
spraying the metal with grinding threads;
cutting of carved metals with shortened wire shelter with us by welding of precious stones
Lacking modern technical means and equipment, morning Kazakh jewelry created a simple reputation - works of art that struck the white world
Table 1 Products made by craftsmen and jewelry of the Kazakh people
The need for finer skill and free imagination to make such quantitative products is undeniable
Obviously, our ancestors had it
In the area of ​ ​ the city of Taraz, located along the Silk Road, the production of "wild" non-ferrous metallurgy is developed due to the presence of ore from copper lead
Extracted metals and objects processed by fabulous craftsmen in many methods
The main of these methods: amalgamation of altar jewelry of amalgamation (mercury treatment) relief design masking welded welded log-glued log-glued cap-and-cap torsion, shape silver coating silver-flag ornamental grinding.
Astana craftsmen widely used many methods of metalworking, as it was above by simple means
Is it possible not to believe the works of the masters of the Kazakh land, which were thousands of years ago? Jewelry made by them today, cause pride in the new generation
Educates himself as an artificial child

When researching the Abai Kazakh National University on the basis of the Model Program of the state general compulsory standard of higher professional education in the subject 6M012000 - "Organic chemistry of cyclic compounds" for students of the 3rd year specialty 6M012000 - Kazakh State Women's Pedagogical University in the specialty 6M012000 - "Chemistry"
Test questions conducted for students' independent work of testing and approval of educational material during the period of experimental pedagogical work reflect the results of psychological and chemical trainings of their own control
In order to create opportunities for creative and poetic search of students, an increase in the professional competence of students in methods and types of classes was revealed, in which the continuity system of elements of updated technology classified in the module was preserved
Reference words: method of teaching critical thinking, method of independent working modular training synquein pedagogical technology coefficient of creative bending of training
In the process of training future specialists at the university, our society sets new tasks
In the space of globalization, innovative technologies occupy a special place
In this regard, the development of the thinking of today's students shows the acute urgency of the current issue, when the achievement of competence is in the modern interests of unification [1]
To solve this problem, a system of orientation on the result of the use of new education technologies is currently based
The university carried out the following research work in order to determine the possibility of adopting educational material to form the pedagogical foundations of the intellectual professional spiritual development of critical thinking of students and determine its level
During the study, a working curriculum was created, developed on the basis of the Model Program of the State General Compulsory Standard of Higher Professional Education for the subject "Organic Chemistry of Cyclic Compounds" for students of 3 courses of chemical specialty of the Kazakh State Women's Pedagogical University named after Abay
The curriculum is developed according to modular training technology by a system of mutually grouped parts, in the structure of which various types of classes and methods are used, in which the system of continuity of critical thinking technologies is preserved
During the period of experimental pedagogical work, independent control psychological and chemical trainings were conducted to test and consolidate educational material at various levels of thinking for the independent work of students
As a result, the goal was set to form a new thinking of the actions of students to stimulate their personal opportunities to fulfill educational tasks
"Chemical properties of saturated hydrocarbons."
The educational material, which served as the basis for this type of training, regulates the types of checks of the student's actions in the same order [2-3]
The training material consists of separate logical sections; After mastering each department, the student independently performs tasks and goes to the next department with the correct answer; continues to monitor the repetition of similar tasks presented in if the answer is incorrect
Title of Table 1 "Chemical properties of saturated hydrocarbons"
The main goal of a lecture lesson using elements of updated technology is to awaken thought, allowing you to draw a conclusion about yourself
The proposed theme "Disaccharides and Polysaccharides" has problematic conditions for students to actively participate in its solution, as a result of which professional knowledge was formed and skills and power were developed.
- table title "Disaccharides and polysaccharides"
New training technology - a combination of different methods and forms of training with the use of effective methods and methods of training makes effective use of the educational material, systematizing the quality of knowledge and qualifications
Innovative technological methods allow to achieve the planned quality of education, ensuring timely training of students in the educational process

Summary
Contents of the educational module "Chemistry and Food"
One of the main modern requirements of education is the formation of functional literacy among students
It should use new approaches to learning technology and assessment of learning outcomes in structuring the content of education
One of the main tasks of changing the content of the chemistry course in undergraduate studies is to increase its applied direction
Usually the module "Chemistry and food"
The built-in course "Applied Chemistry" is included in the content
But there the content of this module is provided in a generalized and structured form, methodological approaches to the use in the training of bachelor's specialists are not sufficiently prepared.
To resolve the conflict, it is proposed to structure the contents of the Chemistry and Food module in a new way
There are two ways to implement it: by food or by classes of organic compounds
Undergraduate students studying in a chemical specialty benefit from using the second path
Because continuity is consistent with the principles of systematics and knowledge intensity
Laboratory sessions to develop skills with experimental axes along students are planned
Applied direction of teaching methodical methodical methodical approach to the professional competence of the system for assessing the results of teaching functional literacy of educational technology of educational content.
Summary
Application of modular technologies in teaching courses "Modern chemical technologies"
The article provides for the training of undergraduates of the 2nd year of the specialty "Chemistry" 6M011200 using new technologies in the course "Modern Chemical Technologies"
One of the main topics of the course "Modern chemical technologies" we called modular technology:
"Nanochemistry and nanomaterials"
The topic of this lecture is divided into seven educational elements (SI), which are connected with each other from the point of view of thought
For each read item
the task is set on the topics and tasks (OE-1) of initial self-monitoring on the elements of training, where the main goal is to test the primary knowledge of students about nanochemistry
Further, the OE of the new material (2-5) are as follows: types of nanochemistry (theoretical experimental applied) types of nanomaterials, the main methods of their production in various fields of technology and in production, as well as the development directions of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies of world practice and the development of nanotechnologies in Kazakhstan
Completeness of perception of educational process efficiency after each PU is determined by memorization of theoretical foundations and application execution
On the sidelines of the lecture - exits (OE-6)
- Assessment of the degree of assimilation of knowledge
The use of modular technology in seminars and lectures of this course ensures the full assimilation of material to increase information capacity
In addition, this technique is one of the ways to work individually with each student, it is easy and easy to understand and master new material, the effectiveness of which is proven as a result of intermediate and current observations
Reference words: technology of modular training of nanochemistry of nanomaterials modern chemical technologies of nanotechnology

The proposed article refers to the formation of effective studies of students through extracurricular work in biology
The preparation of visual aids is also the specific research activities of students, conducted under the guidance of a teacher, the study of the surrounding wildlife and various branches of medicine of agricultural forestry, the promotion of knowledge about nature protection among the population
In order to organize targeted extracurricular work, it is necessary to determine the biological interests of students and develop them; submit a separate order in accordance with their interests; need to gradually expand and complicate the content of the task
In the article, we decided to separately focus on forms of extracurricular work in biology
Extracurricular activities: plant and animal control and practice
Manufacture and control of artificial nests
Self-checking
Production of visual aids
Reading popular science literature and preparing abstract for the report
Group episodic biology classes Organized in preparation for a mass event at the school (Biology Week
Health Week "Bird Day" and t.
); The teacher proposes to create a group of children interested in biology and find the necessary materials for them, prepare a report and art numbers for the holiday
Group episodic works: studying the nature of the native land; Tree at school
enumeration (inventory) of shrub and shrub plants; determination of species composition of birds in nearby reservoirs; organized to study the daily activity of any species of animals
Reference words: student actions, extracurricular work, episodic work, a circle of young naturalists
The Concept of Environmental Education, prepared jointly by the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2002, states that "one of the main reasons for the general deterioration of the environmental situation is the insufficient or too low environmental education of workers in various areas of the economy related to the environmental use of specialists, including other structures of the population"
The establishment of landscaping of the yard of educational institutions depends primarily on the heads of these institutions
The entrepreneurial leader does not always disregard the introduction of new technology to improve the quality of education in school, as well as the improvement of environmental protection methods that contribute to the personal development of the student
With high-quality education of students in the educational institution, it is necessary to equip its yards, internal corridors and premises in the school building by properly growing green plants
At the same time, it is important that the school have enough oxygen in the school yards and its interior rooms, that the younger generation spending half the day at school have a good mood, and air cleanliness is in the first place.
Issues of informed education of children in extracurricular work
Satimbekov S.
and t
b disclosed in scientific papers [1234]
The school is not only an educational house, but also the second educational house for schoolchildren who like how they become beautiful and green.
The beauty of the classrooms of the schoolyard and corridor is the main environment in which the child awakens aesthetic feelings and teaches elegance
A child with high taste is trying to get an education
The combination of flower stripes planted in the classroom with the same taste in the classroom forms the responsibility for the child's ability to care for vegetation
A child accustomed to loving luxury from his youth does not spoil plants, but stops them
"Tomorrow our country is in the hands of the younger generation, and the fate of the younger generation is in the hands of the teacher," the head of state said, stressing that teachers who educate students pay attention to the aesthetic education of students [5]
A special place in the formation of practical research skills of students is occupied by extracurricular work in biology
Extracurricular work is the organization of voluntary work performed outside classes under the guidance of a teacher to form creative freedoms and cognitive interests of students in order to supplement and expand the content of the school curriculum
Firstly, speaking about the features of extracurricular work in the subject of biology:
Part of the biology education system
Optional for all students
Held in extracurricular time
Organized for students interested in biology
Significantly increase the scope of the biology curriculum
Extracurricular work: education of the scientific approach of students; the formation of a culture of work and love for nature; enables the development of self-control and courage skills [3 4 6]
With regard to the substantive basis of extracurricular work: specific research activities of students led by a teacher; study of environmental wildlife and various branches of agricultural medicine is the preparation of visual manuals to promote knowledge about nature protection among the population
In order to organize targeted extracurricular work, it is necessary to determine the biological interests of students and develop them; submit a separate order in accordance with their interests; need to gradually expand and complicate the content of the task
In the paper we decided to address separately the forms of extracurricular biology work:
Types of extracurricular work:
Plant and Animal Control and Practice
Manufacture and control of artificial nests
Self-checking
Production of visual aids
Reading popular science literature and preparing abstract for the report
Group episodic biology classes:
Organized in preparation for a mass event at the school (Biology Week
Health Week "Bird Day" and t.
The teacher proposes to create a group of children interested in biology and find the necessary materials for them, prepare a report and art numbers for the holiday
Group episodic works: studying the nature of the native land; enrolment (inventory) of woody and shrub plants at school; determination of species composition of birds in nearby reservoirs; organized to study the daily activity of any species of animals
The main form of extracurricular work is a circle of young naturalists
Unlike occasional group work, the circle brings together students who systematically perform various tasks over one or more years
The composition of the circle is usually stable
A circle can have one or a number of classes (age features of a circle)
And in a circle of different ages, schoolchildren of different classes are engaged
The purpose of organizing a circle of young naturalists:
enhancing students' biological knowledge;
training of students in research skills in observation and experimentation;
creating the opportunity for students to educate themselves to a scientific understanding of wildlife
Work in a circle of young naturalists is carried out systematically
The composition of the circle will be voluntary, but stable
Work on general topics, that is, familiarization with literature is carried out by performing practical tasks using individual group and collective work
A mass naturalistic event is organized at the initiative of the teacher with the active participation of members of the circle of teachers and parents
A large number of students (parallel classes of the school) will be involved in mass naturalistic events
Mass naturalistic events: the lives and lives of famous biologists; harvesting nutrients for birds in winter by tree and shrub planting companies; date of health and t
ensures the involvement of students in extracurricular work
Extracurricular results to be applied in lessons
Observations should be reported
Speak on a report prepared on the basis of extracurricular education
Due to the limited time devoted to studying the subject in biology classes, students receive only basic knowledge in a wide range of biological sciences
By satisfying students' cognitive interests, deepening and specifying students' programmatic biological knowledge, the teacher involves them in biology overtime [6 7]
Thus, extracurricular work is a form of organization for students of practical work performed outside classes on group and individual tasks of a teacher related to the study of a biology course to be mandatory performed outside classes
In conclusion, it is possible through extracurricular work in biology by forming an effective study of students to self-regulate their independent search.

The development of the educational system in the use of modern innovative pedagogical technologies is distinguished by the rapid dynamic development of the way to improve creative search
This article is intended for application of problematic technologies of chemistry course in professional college
The importance and importance of problematic training technology is also considered, the development of cognitive actions of trainees using this technology is described.
Education system in Kazakhstan includes general and vocational education depending on content of educational programs
Secondary education in the country, compulsory and general, is divided into secondary and secondary vocational primary
Primary vocational education will continue in vocational colleges on the basis of basic general education in lycées in the amount of 2-3 years
Currently, in the process of vocational education, teachers, along with systematic professional education, with the opening of general compulsory education, are raising interest in the qualifications of students with a deep combination of creative skills and the ability to apply the knowledge gained in future professions
Analyzing the results of pedagogical practice, we came to the conclusion that when teaching a chemistry course, it is possible to increase their cognitive activity by drawing up a plan and course of classes for the independent search of students
The more students perform educational activities during lessons, the more intense their actions will be rational and targeted educational work
Therefore, it is important to use problematic training technologies to increase the cognitive activity of students when teaching a chemical course
Problematic conditions of problematic training of the padagological technology of organic chemistry
Social and economic political changes in society require improvement of the sphere of education, pose new challenges
The aim of the ongoing reforms in the education system of our State - to enter the global scale with ensuring qualitative changes in the market economy requires the creation of new legal financial and material scientific and methodological conditions and adequate provision by specialists in order to deepen and develop this process based on the preservation of achievements accumulated in the educational and reformatory space of education
Today's requirement poses great challenges to the general education system on its teaching methods
In any country, much attention is paid to raising offspring
Because the future of our generation
Only those countries that will have qualified specialists in the future will become the forerunners of civilization
Civilized states are distinguished primarily by the development of a culture of science and economics
Raising society's economy to the world level depends on the development of the education system
This is evidenced by the opinion of the Head of State, included in the collection of information and statistical materials "Education and Science in the Republic of Kazakhstan," that the country, which failed to develop knowledge in the 21st century, is at a standstill.
At the same time, the Republic of Kazakhstan sets fundamentally new tasks, such as the use of new teaching methods, especially in the education system - raising the level of world education in order to keep up with the world level after the period of independence
In the State program "Development of education": ensuring access to quality education for all groups of the population; Updating the content and structure of education based on world experience and sustainable development principles; in accordance with the recommendations of the international standard classification of education, a number of specific tasks are set, such as improving the educational process of vocational education on an educational, methodological and scientific basis [1]
The main principles of the development of students in technical and vocational education include: the modularity of subject programs for accounting for understandable individuality, the continuity of the content of education, the continuity of the stages of vocational education, the orientation of the activity of educational technologies to the result of the intersectoral nature of management
To ensure the comprehensiveness and attractiveness of educational assessments in technical and vocational education, it is necessary to implement various measures: the introduction of interactive technologies for remote management of the information problematic level of training in the system of technical and vocational education, as well as the use of the opportunities of the Kazakh educational web portal, etc.
At present, we are not mistaken that the main goal of each teacher is to educate a high-class specialist with high-quality knowledge, with a deep combination of creative skills and interests in the professionalism of students, linking them with systemic professional education, as well as general compulsory education.
Therefore, together with our love for our specialties, we used the following pedagogical technologies in teaching chemistry at colleges of professional education, aiming to become real masters of their professions with high-quality knowledge in the future: problematic training and competent training
Students studying at Almaty College of Telecommunications and Mechanical Engineering, where we practiced, will study chemistry in the 1st-2nd year
Of the groups with in-depth study of various specialties, we gave level tasks for 3 groups and selected the highest and lowest quality groups for practice
We conducted surveys of the third group controlled by the first group as an experienced group
Lectures in the selected groups were compiled through problem learning and interdisciplinary communication and level tasks were applied when approving and evaluating the knowledge received when summarizing the trained sections
During the course of general chemistry, an in-depth master class was held linking the selected specialties of students of each group with chemistry
The goal of literacy technology is to ensure that each student learns educational material depending on its level of development
Based on the materials studied in grades 8-9, the level tasks obtained in the first control work were developed in order to test the concepts of chemistry and general knowledge of students
Based on the results of these tasks, the selected groups (1119000 "Turning and metalworking (in each industry) 1307000" Use of network telecommunication facilities and alerts ") were involved in further practice.
Knowledge testing when summarizing the results of each section of the experience was carried out through level tasks
Problem learning includes not only the student's self-reading of all educational material or an independent solution to the problem, but also the reproductive actions of students, explaining the teacher, compiling a task and performing exercises
The training process is organized on a problematic basis
The main feature of this training is an independent solution to the problem of training
The goals of problem training are:
training in logical scientific creative thinking;
education, based on the formation by students of a scientific dialectical-materialistic worldview of a motivated and reliable compilation of educational material without the formation of only knowledge;
contribute to building the strength of knowledge, as students are well aware of the information that they have found on their own;
forming beliefs such as influencing the emotional field of the student, satisfying them with the complexity of mental actions on the reliability of their forces;
Development of simple search and research skills;
developing student activity through the stress of his interest in science, attaching importance to his desire for knowledge [2 3]
To conduct RD-roblem training, it is necessary to fulfill three conditions: presence of problem situations; the student's willingness to find a solution; possibility to solve the problem
Creating a Problem Situation - Core Core of Problem Learning
A problem situation is a pedagogical situation where a teacher forces a student to look for an answer to a problem formulated by him or the student
Therefore, the basic idea of ​ ​ problem learning can be formulated as follows: a significant part of the knowledge is not provided to students in a ready state, which students receive in the process of independent cognitive activity when solving a problem situation
One of the methods of reminder is problematic situation
The problem situation is used to solve students some difficult issues in the educational process
Problematic situations make a schoolboy think
Decides either himself or with the help of a teacher
The most valuable problem situation allows students to learn more about educational materials
Because it continues with science, that is, in the process of learning, the student turns to science
The teacher must cooperate with the student in solving the problem situation, and the student will make joint efforts to solve the problem, strongly speaking about the correct or incorrect response to the initiative task
Problem setting does not always lead to a problem situation
Vygotsky formulated two levels of development of thinking
The psychologist believes that training should be taught based on the zone of close development and be slightly higher than the opportunities of students
He noted that it is necessary to remember a new interest only in the case of new experience.
The main condition for the emergence of a problematic situation is that the teacher and student see the problem in the nearest development zone
His decision - the student should be based on the way of thinking knowledge and the way of solving it
Therefore, students must feel insufficient education to complicate the problem situation
Finding ways to solve a problem situation to create a process of thinking is possible at this stage and students should be ready for action
And the opposite situation causes distrust due to the underdevelopment of self-consciousness [3 4]
Analyzing the results of activity in the process of education, they came to the conclusion that when planning classes when teaching chemistry, it is necessary to take into account the activity and independent search of students
How active the learning and learning activities of the trainees during the course guarantee a high intensity of purposeful and rational educational work of the process
Therefore, we believe that the use of problem research technologies in chemistry training will help increase the cognitive activity of students
A method that allows problem learning to develop for learners
Increasing the activity of instructor trainees' cognitive thinking by creating problematic questions or actions on issues of correct problem-setting creates the conditions for searching from the necessary educational materials with insufficient knowledge to solve contradictions and emerging problems
Problem learning creates conditions for a student to transition from a passive (object of education) view of an asset (subject of education)
Performance of problem training consists of several stages [3]:
Preparation for the adoption of the problem
Reminder of knowledge learned in everyday life in other disciplines at previous stages of training, that is, updating knowledge
Creating a Problem Situation
This is a very difficult and responsible period
Creating a problematic situation requires high skill from a teacher
Here, the student cannot solve the task based on his knowledge and actions, that is, new or additional education is needed to solve it
The student should feel the need for additional education
But it is necessary to solve the problem so that the student can get medicine
The student receives additional instructions from the teacher with insufficient education to complete the task
The main condition of a clear formulation of the problem situation
Formulate a problem
Wording in the form of an informative report or task based on the circumstances of the problem
The teacher shows which question to look for the answer to
If the student himself concludes, he will be very effective
This consists of several steps:
forecasting;
Drawing up a plan to solve each forecast in order to verify it;
confirmation or rebuttal of the assumption
Prove the correctness of the decision
Rationality proven by practice when possible
In the role of the organizer of the educational process, the teacher should be a host and a satellite, but the presence of a source of knowledge negatively affects
It is necessary to give clear instructions that the student can solve
The most widely used methods of problem training; problematic presentation of the material - an independent search for heuristic conversation and research activities of students
Problem statement
This happens at the first meeting with a phenomenon when students do not have sufficient education
At this time, the teacher himself is looking for
Teacher shows learning new knowledge and discoveries and teaches learners to look for
The problematic content of the material requires from the teacher not only full knowledge of the material, but also knowledge of how science develops
Conducted several research lectures and practical exercises using the technology of problem training in hydrocarbon distribution training from the course of organic chemistry
So-called problem training suggests that students can independently find a solution to the problem
Explaining the teacher in our work is problematic
provides for the execution of exercises and tasks, the solution of which should help in solving them with asking questions
Problem solving system through problematic method of training determines this development and training
That is, the effective use by students of the knowledge obtained in previous classes in the new conditions
Three methods used in problem training are most effective: problematic presentation of material, interview in the form of cognitive cognition and the third - research action of self-isolation of students [5]
One of the features of the problematic training technology is that the student is growing interest in the emergence of a desire for a comprehensive independent solution to the issue of increasing activity as a subject seeking to achieve the result independently or with the help of a teacher.
The effectiveness of the application of problem training can be assessed by the following criteria: 1) the presence of motivation to solve the problem situation (I want to consider ways to solve the problem and consider the answers to questions); 2) the presence of emotionally positive positive changes (search activity is very interesting to me); 3) positive perception of students subjective innovations (I learned to solve the problem with which I myself achieved the result); 4) awareness of the value of assessing new knowledge (I need it so that I learn to solve this problem myself); 5) to know the general generalizing method of solving a problem situation: fact analysis, achieving the result by checking the correctness of the presentation of hypotheses
The problem situation awakens the possibility of solving the issue of finding the actions of the student during the educational process
The presentation of problems and research issues in the course of the lesson inspires students to think creatively, causing the desire to receive a deeper education [6 7]
The organization of such a system in the course of organic chemistry corresponds to the structure of the content of the subject
When studying the course of organic chemistry, you can consider a system of fundamental problem questions that arise one after another and contain scientific questions: determining the structure of a substance molecule (structural electronic space); provides for the practical application of changes in properties with respect to the structure of compounds; considers methods of producing organic substances from various raw materials
In the course of training the class of organic compounds, these and other major issues can be considered with the compilation of problem situations
Even from the first introductory classes, a problematic question arises: why there are a lot of organic compounds in our lives, what is the importance of their role
In the study of the topic of the theory of chemical construction of organic compounds, problematic issues arise
Students will have to take a deeper look at construction theory to find answers to questions
A teacher can not only find the right answers to many questions, but also find solutions
As a solution to a fundamental issue, one of the main issues of organic chemistry will make sure that the properties of the substance depend on construction
Familiarity with organic compounds begins with saturated hydrocarbons
Describing the structural formula of methane then spatial and electronic structure, the teacher gives an idea of ​ ​ hybridization of electronic clouds to other learners of the concepts of valence of chemical bonding
Classes will be filled with interesting creative creativity
At the same time, aldehydes and t alcohols not saturated with aromatic hydrocarbons
when passing the topics under consideration on the content of the course of organic chemistry, it is also possible to introduce problematic issues, exacerbating topical issues of everyday life
In an explanation of, for example, the topic of hydrocarbons: "Why is it sweet taste when chewing bread for a long time?" or glucose reacts with copper hydroxide Cu (OH) 2 when experimentally showing the properties of glucose and fructose, why fructose does not act
interesting problematic questions arise
Practical work to clarify issues of concern is important
The training workshop is also an effective way to address problem situations
In particular, when studying the course of organic chemistry, it is possible to control the desire of students to independently solve problems in solving individual or group issues on fundamental issues
Our experience shows that the application of problematic learning technologies in education increases the activity of creative actions of students in the field of research and thinking ability
The student, that is, the student, must be able to receive education, give an educational institution
Knowledge gained can be described as competent if students are able to use skills in life
Formation of a trainee by an authorized person
knowing the multifaceted nature of search requires deep perseverance, identifying also the process of learning and education
The support that will have the main influence on the spiritual and cultural development of any people is education
improving the quality of training and improving the knowledge of students with the help of new technologies

Summary
Environmental understanding of students and students in youth tourism
as forming means
Republic of Kazakhstan 2007-2011
The programme for the development of tourism for adolescent children is one of the main factors in the development of tourism, which educates tourism culture
This article will consider the formation of environmental education through youth tourism
Role and importance of youth tourism in tourism of Kazakhstan to be considered
b Articles on domestic scientific journals analyzed
Consumption because global understanding of environmental problems associated with an environment with a low level of environmental knowledge is all or not enough
Therefore, it is impossible to create a new environmental thinking on the principles of equal development of nature and society.
"In accordance with the Program of Measures for the Implementation of the Concept of Environmental Education and the Education of the Young Generation, Approved by Cabinet of Ministers Decision No. 137 of 3 February 1997 for the Ministry of Culture of Education and Health and the Ministry of Ecology of the Republic of Kazakhstan and national environmental education programmes, which adopted general principles of environmental policy; environmental education and training and development to identify specific United Nations phases of UNESCO
environmental education developed by the
it is considered
Among many challenges, secondary school students will have a special place to deepen and expand complex environmental education
Proper organized pedagogical - educational and extracurricular integration is an effective tool for educating the ecological culture of adolescents in working with the environment
This formulation is based on a thorough study of theoretical research in the field of pedagogy and psychology
Today there are many environmental problems
Not only in Kazakhstan, but all over the world
This is due to the fact that educational institutions pay little attention to the environmental education of students
This led to the fact that people treated nature exclusively as a source of raw materials
Reference words: tourism - children's and youth educational development local history
The article refers to the systemic foundations of tourism infrastructure in Kazakhstan, the infrastructure of international tourism.
The place and possibilities of tourism infrastructure development in the country's economy will also be considered.
The modern tourism industry is considered one of the highly profitable and rapidly growing segments of international trade in services
Profit from tourism Oil export ranks 3rd after export of petroleum products and car production
Due to the fact that the traditional directions of the world tourist market have reached the limit of recreational capacity, it is planned to open new tourist zones
As a result, tourism profits will increase
Kazakhstan can take advantage of this opportunity and find its place in the tourist market
The most initial step in the development of tourism in the country is the development of infrastructure that contributes to the development of this industry
As you know, the socio-economic importance of small and medium-sized businesses is the systemic formation of the market in developing competition in the development of the country's economy in containing unemployment problems and introducing new technologies
Small businesses are able to operate in more flexible new production sectors due to changing market-prone conditions than large businesses
Tourism is a large sector of the economy, so developed countries are making every effort to develop this industry
The tourism industry, including the hotel and restaurant business, is developing at a faster pace than in other sectors of the world economy
According to experts, by 2020 tourism will become the largest in the world, which will increase the number of jobs and create entrepreneurship in this area
The main goal of tourism development in the country is the formation of a modern highly efficient and competitive tourist complex in Kazakhstan
Given the unique natural potential, it is obvious that the following areas of tourism can be developed in the country: cultural and cognitive ecological extreme business recovery, etc.
Foreign tourism industry tourism resources national tourism product outbound tourism Domestic tourism tourism infrastructure marketing strategy global tourism business
Today, an indicator of the development of tourism - civilization in human life and society is a way of recognizing the environment as a method of increasing the cultural level and restoring human health
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev's program "Kazakhstan-2050" and "Industrial and innovative development of Kazakhstan" will consider tourism and tourism infrastructure as a priority area of development of the country's economy
Therefore, without the effective use of the diverse potential of various regions of Kazakhstan, it is impossible to turn tourism into a successful industry of the economy
At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the importance of natural tourism resources for the implementation of tourism projects
Tourism does not deplete natural resources, on the contrary, it has a multiplier effect, stimulating the development of many sectors of the economy
Of course, tourism will have a positive impact on a number of economic and cultural parameters to reduce the coldness of the global economic crisis
The creation of a large number of jobs in this field of small and medium-sized enterprises, the development of national cultural traditions and the creation of a positive political image of the country, etc.
Of course, to achieve the level of international standards for tourism infrastructure services, it is necessary to invest a lot of capital, but the investments provided, being strategic and long-term, have a significant effect that exceeds the extraction of mineral resources in the future
For the development of regional tourism, the presence of a landscape and climatic hydrography of the flora and fauna and reservoirs are taken into account
In addition, the availability of cultural and historical values ​ ​ will increase the possibility of using this territory for recreation
Improving the competitiveness of the region is associated with the efficient use of resources and improving the living conditions of the population
Tourism in many countries of the world is a large sector of the economy, so developed countries are making every effort to develop this industry
Tourism in the global economy has become one of the leading industries and has become the largest export sector of the economy, competing with the oil refining industry
Also, for the development of tourism, according to economists, it is necessary to solve a number of complex issues, including marketing and management
Requires public and private efforts to develop the tourism sector on earth [1]
The infrastructure of tourism is engineering and communication networks that ensure the proper operation of enterprises in the tourism industry, tourists' access to tourist resources, including roads, construction complexes of related enterprises in the field of tourism
These include road and railway terminals and stations of marine river air traffic control systems for heating electric and telephone systems
The development of tourism infrastructure is an important stage in the planning of the process of opening up and using tourism resources
The greater the efficiency and visibility of the tourist resource, the more important for tourists the convenience of access to these resources
In the context of tourist activity, the republic is currently affected by the low level of development of tourist infrastructure (hotels, campsites, tourist bases, roads, cars, tourist routes)
Nevertheless, public finance policies are needed to develop infrastructure
Despite the fact that tourism is a promising industry, the pace of work by the state to attract foreign investment to finance it is very slow
In addition, the scientific advertising and information system for promoting the national tourism product in the domestic and foreign markets is imperfect
The reason for the underdevelopment of tourism infrastructure is influenced not only by economic difficulties, but also by taxes and various tourist laws, as well as the unforeseen possibility of protecting consumer rights based on state standards
Many travel companies are travel agents of foreign travel companies
As a result, the visits of citizens of Kazakhstan abroad exceed the entry of foreign citizens into our country
Kazakhstani tourist enterprises are poorly organized in working with existing laws and regulatory and technical documents
As a result, there are many violations among arriving tourists
Currently, on the basis of the modernization of the construction of cities along the Great Silk Road, it is necessary to form a tourism infrastructure: service and trade enterprises, national workshops for the art of tourist and miniature complexes, ethnographic museums and cultural theaters -
ceremonial and religious-historical centers and other tourist sites
As you know, the main tourist and recreational resources in the Kazakhstan part of the Great Silk Road are located in Zhetysu and South Kazakhstan, especially in these regions, in particular, in cities such as Taraz Turkestan and Almaty
An important role in the development of international relations in the field of tourism was played by the fact that Kazakhstan in 1993 was considered a full member of the World Tourism Organization, securing international business contracts in the field of tourism
On the basis of these agreements, the Government of foreign States recognizes Kazakhstan as a State with a rich tourism future [2]
According to the Statistics Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the number of enterprises and individual entrepreneurs engaged in tourism activities in the country in 2012 amounted to 1802 units, and places of accommodation - 660 units
Currently, 1602 travel firms operate in the country
In 2012, they served 14395 people on entry tourism, 134889 people on exit tourism, 71549 people on domestic tourism
The total number and volume of works performed by tourist companies in 2012 amounted to 83500034 thousand tenge [3]
There are 118 specially protected natural areas on the territory of Kazakhstan, including 11 state national parks in which regulated tourist use aimed at the development of ecotourism is allowed
Considering that its objects can be natural and natural-anthropogenic landscapes, as well as the fact that traditional culture in them constitutes a single integrity with the natural environment, the development of ecological tourism will not only provide financial support for natural territories, but also create an interest in their preservation
In Kazakhstan, due to the tourism policy pursued by the "order" of the Center (Moscow), the country remained isolated
Until 1990, tourist activities were limited to the Baltic Sea coast of the Caucasian Peninsula of the USSR and the historical centers of the countries of Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan) and Russia
Currently, in international tourism, tourists want to get acquainted with new countries than with tourist zones that have long ended
In this regard, the constantly developing territory of Kazakhstan has the full opportunity to receive foreign tourists
Natural regions of interest and "wishing to master" them in the country Or Alatau Northern Tian-Shan Zharkent - Taldykorgan Balkhash North Zhetysu (Dzungar) Alatau Zhambyl Turkestan Sairam - Shymkent Upper Bukhtarma and Mangistau
In addition, they are interested in the state national parks (Or Alatau Altynemel) of Aksu-Jabagly Bayanaul Karkaraly Burabay Kokshetau Korgalzhyn
From the point of view of the state, the above-mentioned tourist facilities are granted benefits to 54 states - politically and economically stable by obtaining visas for foreign citizens
It is assumed that as a result, the number of tourists to the country will be brought to 150-200 thousand, and not 80-100 thousand [4]
Countries, mainly developing tourism, usually adopt legislative measures that stimulate the development of tourism infrastructure, including hotels
At the same time, government agencies and financial institutions expect that investments in tourism will create new jobs, bring a certain income
Therefore, many countries will adopt legislative decisions, such as tax incentives that encourage foreign and domestic investment
The creation of a mechanism for granting benefits and long-term lending to tourism organizations for the development of tourism infrastructure will contribute to the growth of investment in the development of a competitive tourism industry
Development of promising directions of tourism industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan 2010
- In accordance with the program "Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index" for 2014, the goal was set to increase Kazakhstan's position from 92 in 2009 to 90 in 2015
As the Head of State noted, in the development of the economy in the country and in order to improve the vital activities of the population of Kazakhstan, it is important to solve infrastructure issues
State should create conditions and invest for development of tourism infrastructure in Kazakhstan
In connection with national tourism features in the development of tourism infrastructure in Kazakhstan, it is necessary to invest in the following details:
development of the hotel base;
development of leisure and recreational complexes;
the development of catering facilities;
equipping tourist and resource centers;
establishment of service enterprises, production of trade souvenirs, workshops of national crafts;
creation of production complexes, including the production of tourist equipment, guides and souvenirs;
Development of transport infrastructure for public use and tourist satisfaction;
restoration and scientific study of historical and cultural objects;
research of natural and historical-cultural resources of the state;
creation of recreation places for ethnographic museums of religious and tourist complexes and historical and religious centers of theaters;
Development of domestic infrastructure: water supply for telecommunications sewerage;
creation of new tourist routes;
protection of protected areas;
planning for the construction of medium and small tourist complexes, which are put into operation during the year;
material renewal of tourist bases
"In this direction, the following measures should be taken to develop the infrastructure of Kazakhstan":
attracting foreign and domestic investment in tourism facilities in order to develop the material and technical base of tourism;
Increased competition in the infrastructure market;
planning of tourist complexes in the Republic of Kazakhstan;
Monitoring of construction sites in tourism development areas;
Compliance of tourist complexes with international standards;
Development of existing tourism infrastructure;
Renovation of hotels that meet international standards;
Development of tourist facilities that make up the system through foreign investment
Development of tourism as an actively developing sector of post-industrial economy in modern conditions has special relevance for the economy of Kazakhstan
The tourist product will reach the economic category only in the conditions of group tourism
To increase the efficiency of tourism products in Kazakhstan, it is necessary to have a developed tourism industry
Foreign capital can be raised for local tourism projects
But this capital should not take a dominant role, it is important to use it as a founder [5]
Statistics Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan:
Program on development of promising directions of tourism industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2010 - 2014

Since traditional areas of the world tourism market have almost reached the limits of their recreational capacity, tourism growth will prevail due to new territories with tourist visits
In this regard, Kazakhstan has the opportunity to find its worthy place in the world tourism market
Of these, in the analysis of the general state of competitiveness of tourism firms in Almaty, they came to this conclusion
The company "And the Arch" pays the most attention to advertising (announcement in teletexts of ads in advertising programs on television in telephone certificates on distribution of business cards in advertising programs on television)
"World Travel Service"
"Grand Tour" (announcement in the parish distribution of advertising cards on the stands of the city)
Tourism company "Kami Travel" decided to analyze this data and give great importance to advertising in the first stages of activity
Stubborn words: tourism industry at the price of tourism firm optimal office manager intensity of international tourism domestic excursion tourism
Tourism today is one of the most profitable and dynamic sectors of the economy
Tourism will not only accelerate the socio-economic development of the country, but also increase the authority of the region, will contribute to the introduction of new types of information dissemination to increase public knowledge
High rate of tourism development, large currency revenues actively affect various sectors of the economy, which contributes to the formation of the tourism industry
Tourism industry makes up one side of the tourism system, the other side of the tourism system - tourism resources
Kazakhstan should turn production policy to the indigenous processing direction in a decade
At the same time, tourism occupies a special place
Tourism in the category of seven clusters of the country's economy
The tourism industry, which is the most dynamic sector of the world economy, has a strong influence on the economic, socio-cultural and environmental spheres
Although tourism covers domestic and international tourism and takes into account that 80% of tourists come to domestic tourism, the strategy for developing tourism worldwide is now characterized by a redistribution of national income [1]
Tourism plays a major role in the global economy
According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), it provides more than 11% of international investment in a tenth of the world's gross national product for every 9 jobs in world production
The modern tourism industry is one of the segments of international trade in highly profitable and dynamic services
Tourism revenues are in a stable third place after oil and car exports [2]
Since traditional areas of the world tourism market have almost reached the limits of their recreational capacity, tourism growth will prevail due to new territories with tourist visits
In this regard, Kazakhstan has the opportunity to find its worthy place in the world tourism market
Therefore, we conducted a study to analyze the general condition of three tourism companies in Almaty and conducted a description of the total income
Initial information on expert travel companies (Table-1)
Table 1 - Information on travel companies
Due to the fact that they are used to working with reliable and proven operators that allow increasing the demand for tours, these 3 firms have an assortment of tourist routes, and the company offers an even larger assortment
The subject (type) of the toughest competition in the tourism field includes:
price;
reputation of the firm;
quality;
The company "And the Arch" pays the most attention to advertising (announcement in teletexts of ads in advertising programs on television in telephone certificates on distribution of business cards in advertising programs on television)
"World Travel Service"
"Grand Tour" (announcement in the parish distribution of advertising cards on stents of the city)
Tourism company "Kami Travel" decided to analyze this data and give great importance to advertising in the first stages of activity
It is convenient to use the method of market segmentation by main competitors, which allows to organize information (Table 2) to estimate relative advantages on these issues.
Table 2 - Segmentation of the Market by Tourism Firms by Main Competitors Allowing Information Systematization
Evaluation was carried out according to a 10-point system
Travel company "Ve - Arka" - the main competitor
The maximum total number of points is 110, from which you can achieve leadership (leadership)
Customer Research
You need to find buyers of the product and study the demand
We use the following methods: interview request - answers
The results of all performed works are combined into a single diagram in order to identify individual customer segments
We study not only the solvency of people, but also their attitude to vacation, that is, to what vacation should be
Tourism is divided into different types and forms
Of these, we determine only the best and compare with the data in our work
You can define the following types of tourism:
domestic tourism;
external tourism;
short-term tourism;
long-term tourism;
Average travel time from 7 to 14 days
10 days of optimal rest period, but travel period depends on his appointment
by intensity
Tourism in Almaty is seasonal
Spring (60% of sales) winter (14-22%) off-season (23-25%) dead (4%)
for the purpose of travel
Leisure and recreational sports entertaining informative - visiting ecological shops - tours education exotic theology and others
As a result of the study, we found that people choose the following types of tourism:
travel abroad;
short-term;
during the summer or winter season;
for the purpose of entertainment
The tourist company "Kami Travel," which is a travel company, has chosen the following types of services for itself:
international tourism;
domestic tourism;
visits to Kazakhstan;
excursion tourism
We analyzed the possibility of using the tourist company "Kami Travel" taking into account its material base
Thus, they analyzed the income not only from the main activity of the tourist company, that is, from conducting tourist trips, but also from using their own property
The basis for this may be the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Private Property," which makes it possible to receive income from any private property without reference to material or intangible
For example, renting a building logistics base
When a travel company is established, its founders are owners of certain property, introduced as a share in the authorized capital of the travel company
The property to be entered is:
Pentium 4 personal computer (estimated cost of 200,000 tenge (two hundred thousand tenge));
HP Laser Jet 6L printer (estimated cost of 20,000 tenge (twenty thousand tenge));
EPSON 3L xerox (estimated value of 30000 tenge (thirty thousand tenge));
PHONE PANASONIC (estimated value of KZT40,000 (forty thousand tenge));
Since the tourist company does not have its own building, we have the owner of 57 kV
rent an apartment with a common corridor and sanitary separation, equipped with office furniture
Labour Fund
Private business partnership Tourism company Kami Travel is a company founded with citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan
They are the founders and employees of a travel company
As a newly formed travel company, the experience of which is determined
The travel company Kami Travel employs two main employees and an accountant
If the travel company we are considering in the future will work at a high level, then in the future it will be necessary to hire two more specialists
The wages of the employees of the tourist company are shown in the table below (Table-3)
Wage index of employees of a travel company
Relations between employees are well established here
Sometimes a specialist is invited to the place of accountant, who is considered an incoming accountant
Registration of documents for the entry or departure of tourists responsible for other important responsibility, except for the activities of the director - department
Tourism specialist, who holds the position of office manager, sends offers and has direct relations with colleagues
Table 4 - Financial and economic indicators of the tourism company
Unlike service producers with tangible goods as a category of travelers, visitors are consumers of national products
Tourists and excursionists will become consumers of funds for travel
Very little information on travel expenses
But in the UK, they take a place after spending on food and housing in the amount of 19% of the average annual family budget of the British
In Germany, this figure is 16%, in France and the USA - 12%
The average American family will spend about $4,000 on a trip in 1 year
It is this amount that they direct to medicine or food drinks for tobacco, and the cost of clothing will be half as much
The consumer nature of arrivals abroad means a certain orientation of cash flows in the world economy
Tourists and travelers transport a set of money for the arrival of the host from the country of residence
For the purpose of business treatment and culture for pleasure, travelers bring currency to the host country and equally benefit the country's budget
Therefore, their integration into a separate category of visitors is economically profitable
To determine the prospects for the development of the tourist infrastructure base, it is first of all important to distinguish visitors from among travelers as follows: overnight visitors - tourists and one-day travelers
Thus, the concept of "tourist" includes persons traveling for recreational business and other tourist purposes, temporarily staying in places that go beyond the everyday environment as a personal position of the visitor
Only almost all of these signs allow the traveler to be considered a tourist
And to compare the calculation of the tourist product by travelers traveling abroad, we offer the following data (Table-5)
Calculation of tourist product
The analysis showed that the travel company "Kami Travel" continues to work with profit
We have proved the competitiveness and demand of this travel company
The tourism market has not yet been fully studied and there is a desire for further development
Our study says that the travel company Kami Travel is a specific project in which not only 350-400 people will be able to travel, but several people will be employed in the future.

Shymkent Agglomeration Demographics of Religions and Traditions New Master Plan Architectural Third City Southern Industrial Region
South Kazakhstan region is one of the most popular regions in the country
There is no doubt that religion and tradition are among the surviving umbrella zones
The city of Shymkent, which has become the center, is known to the whole of Kazakhstan, even to the whole world
Shymkent is not such a country
Shymkents are people who look at the fund and look at them.
It is possible that residents of the Shymkent side will be able to quickly penetrate into a bright place of stay
Most art historians who have given one shoulder to art come out of this region
We met with brothers who do not hide jealousy in this regard
People of the South make a significant contribution to the development of the country's demography
It is possible that high fertility rates in the region constrain religion and tradition [1]
Administrative and political center - the city of Shymkent
Consists of twelve large districts
Each of them is a separate work
The South, which has preserved religion and tradition with a yellow lighthouse, will surpass others
Islamic religion adheres to undisclosed rules left over from ancestors
According to the new General Plan, priority is given to multi-storey buildings, which will make it possible to more economically use a land fund with an agreed architecture and appearance, to effectively conduct infrastructure
Shymkent will become the third architectural city in the country
Head of State H
In one word, Nazarbayev says: "Shymkent is an architectural city
History is experiencing
I already said that the third city of Kazakhstan after Astana and Almaty - Shymkent
In its message, "Infrastructure Triad - Agglomeration Should Ensure the Dynamic Development of Energy Transport" a City with a Population of Up to 1 Million People "
Agglomerations - over the knowledge-intensive economy of Kazakhstan
The formation and development of agglomerations taking into account the low density of population settlement in the vast territory of the country is an important issue
The first modern urban centers of Kazakhstan will be large cities - Astana and Almaty, then - Shymkent and Aktobe - noted [2]
A number of projects were implemented to turn Shymkent into the 3rd city of the country
As you know, the Head of State instructed to provide 50% of the country's population with domestic medicines by December 2014
Almost all these projects were transferred under the direct supervision of the akim of the region
If we talk about projects for the benefit of the population with a real commissioning, then the creation of new jobs in the city through an increase in production capacities
in order to increase the profitable source of production of competitive types of products, the Southern Industrial Zone was created on the territory of the former phosphorus plant
Its area is 337 hectares
The cost in this region is 438 billion tenge
58 business projects worth tenge to be implemented
If these projects are implemented, 6 thousand new jobs will be created
31 enterprises have already been commissioned and 2,312 new jobs have been created [3]
At the same time, in order for Shymkent to become a green city of the country, a green zone of 1 thousand hectares has been created.
Green area will become a landmark of the city
To create conditions for the rest of residents, parks previously allocated to private ownership were returned to state ownership
"Dendrosayabak" also underwent reconstruction "Independence Park" "Nauryz Square" in the microdistrict "Nursultan"
On Ordabasy Square in Abay Baidibek Bi Park in Dank Park, a museum of courage in Victory Park and other objects of cultural architecture were commissioned
Flows through the central part of the city
The Koshkar ata river in the right part of the city, the channels of the Badam rivers are landscaped and conditions have been created in places of mass recreation
Social facilities have been launched in the social sphere, such as the athletics arena of the indoor swimming pool, the International Tennis Center of two Nazarbayev intellectual schools
According to today's master plan, the territory of the city has grown several times
Approved by Government Decision No. 1110 of 18 October 2013
As a result, the city borders increased from 40 thousand ha to 117 thousand ha
That is, this is 29 times more.
Shymkent agglomeration "Shymkent-Arys" "Shymkent-Baydibek" "Shymkent-Kazygurt" "Shymkent-Ordabasy" "Shymkent-Sayram" "Shymkent-Tolebi"
When expanding the territory of the city and consolidating settlements, attention is paid to the experience of other countries
They are associated with the settlements of the Sairam Tolebi Ordabasy district, to which the socio-economic development of the city adjoins
To develop new lands that give a new impetus to the development of the modern city, a new general plan of the city has been developed
In accordance with the master plan, 40 settlements from the above areas are included in the city limits
These settlements are built rural type
Given this, it was decided to give these settlements the status of a housing estate
When grouping these settlements, firstly, depending on the proximity of the borders of 3 districts of the city, the borders of the same region are attached
From the Enbekshinsky district, 20 settlements from the Abay district 13 are attached to the Al-Farabi district
Secondly, departments for work with the population have been created at the akimats of the districts for the optimal organization of effective state services for the population on the ground
Obviously, the settlements under Shymkent need to develop dynamically
To this end, methods of creating production zones in nearby areas of a large city are being improved
On the achievements of the industrial zone "On t Stik," great attention was paid to the development of new industrial zones
Since 2014, a plan for the development of new industrial zones in the city has been developed for the development of high-tech enterprises that create the basis for the development of related industries using local raw materials.
In particular, in the settlement of Zhuldyz on a plot of 762 hectares near the settlement of Tassay on a plot of 89 hectares near the settlement of Tekesu on an area of ​ ​ 95 hectares, there will be an industrial zone [4]
At the first stage, feasibility studies and design and estimate documentation of industrial zones were developed during the current year
The second phase takes into account the construction of engineering infrastructure, which is the only tool of state support
The expansion of the city brings economic and political benefits to the common population
Secondly, the development of urban planning through the development of new lands
Providing citizens with housing made it possible to implement the Affordable Housing 2020 program Business Roadmap 2020 Employment 2020
Thirdly, it will contribute to the development of small and medium-sized businesses
Fourth, large-scale investments from the state budget and private investors will be attracted to the city's economy in order to create new jobs
All this will improve the life of citizens and increase incomes
By 2017, the population of the city of Shymkent will be 1 million people
there is an assumption that he will reach a person
What conditions will be created for a comfortable life of the population? As you know, with the growth of the population, the need for social facilities will increase
In accordance with the general plan of the city of Shymkent, by 2025 in the field of education it is planned to build general education institutions for 1365 thousand places for 1022 thousand students
Last year, 2 new schools with 1,200 seats were commissioned
In addition, additional work was carried out in six schools, of which four were commissioned
Two "Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools" meeting international educational standards were put into operation at the expense of the national budget [5]
35 billion. Tenge for construction of 7 new schools from the budget in 2014

As a result, three new schools and six additional facilities will be commissioned this year
19 billion tenge for construction of 7 standard kindergartens for 1,830 places

Construction of 4 kindergartens for 860 places is planned this year
As for healthcare, in 2013, 4 facilities were built in the city, polyclinic No. 3 of the Nursultan Novgorod microdistrict was put into operation
In 2014, 3456 million were allocated from the budget for the construction of 7 health facilities.
tender funds
Turning Shymkent into a major center will give impetus to the life of the city
To do this, it is provided that railway stations are ready to update these facilities in accordance with modern requirements
Of course, taking into account the growth in the population of passenger traffic, the construction of these facilities is included in the plan
Moreover, South Kazakhstan region is rich in mosques and minarets
This requires an improvement in the quality of service (service) of the city
According to the master plan, it is planned to move Shymkent airport outside the city and build a freight and passenger station on the north side of the city and organize the Shymkent-2 passenger terminal
Every year the number of immigrants to Shymkent increases
The number of visitors in search of work is changing in the demographic situation
In his Address, the Head of State included Shymkent in the top three urban cities
The main reason why Sayram Tolebi Ordabasy is located in the annex to the Kazygurt districts is that there are a lot of visitors in the city to receive daily income
In addition, the city has the bulk of the recreational places of large enterprises - health education institutions and financial centers
This is also one of the main factors in involving the population in the city
The number of immigrants to the city according to statistics is an average of 65 thousand people annually
The average demographic growth of the city annually is 3% or 153 thousand people.
The annual birth rate is 18,000 children [6]
According to statistics as of April 2014, 1 the population of the city is 6871 thousand people
The administrative border of the city of Shymkent increased from 40 thousand hectares to 117 thousand hectares. 146 settlements with a population of more than 40 thousand people were added from the Sairam tolebi Ordabasy district
Currently, the population of the city is 8331 thousand people
As for unemployment, the economically active population of the city is 3437 thousand people
Of these, the employed population is 3214 thousand people, self-employed - 785 thousand people
Unemployment rate decreased from 69% in 2011 to 66% in 2013
In 2013, out of 21,179 applicants to the employment and social programs department, 97% or 20,569 people.
Along with the creation of new jobs, there are more and more visitors in the city in search of income
In this regard, the permanent employment and housing of those seeking employment in settlements with low potential is being carried out.
As part of the Employment 2020 Program, in 2013 6 multi-storey residential buildings were built with 480 apartments in the Nursultan's microdistrict, of which 73 orphans left without parental care, 39,324 families as a whole were resettled from low-income districts of the region
Labor market indicators improved in the city with the implementation of the Business Roadmap 2020 and Employment 2020 programs
In 2013, 21,179 citizens applied to the Employment and Social Programs Department for employment, of which 97% or 20,569 citizens were employed
New jobs were created mainly in the provision of public services for the provision of economic services at enterprises launched under the Program "Forced Industrial and Innovative Development"
As you know, each region has its own development program
So, Astana is considered a city of innovation
If you pay attention to the conditions under which the city of Shymkent will develop, then you can give the following data
In 2011, the Shymkent City Development Program for 2011-2015 was approved
The main goal of the program is to transform the city of Shymkent into a metropolis, which by 2015 will be able to serve about a million people
Great attention is paid to achievements of industrial zone "On t stik" and issues of development of new industrial zones on the basis of special attention of industrial zones in state sectoral and regional development programs in the coming years [7]
The development of new industrial zones in the city is planned since this year with the aim of developing high-tech enterprises that create the foundations for improving related industries using local raw materials
So, on the territory of the settlement of Zhuldyz it is planned to develop 95 hectares of land in the area of ​ ​ the settlement of Tekesu with an area of ​ ​ 89 hectares near the settlement of Tassay 762 hectares
At the first stage this year, feasibility studies and design and estimate documentation of industrial zones were developed
Construction of engineering infrastructure at the second stage will then be organized and implemented in accordance with the established procedure for selection of investment projects of manufacturing industry with domestic and foreign investments [8]
The benefit of expanding the city to the common population:
Firstly, this is a question of the pace of socio-economic development of the city
Secondly, this step will make it possible to develop urban development, including housing construction
This means providing citizens with housing "Affordable Housing 2020" "Business Roadmap 2020"
Employment 2020 program to be launched
Thirdly, it will contribute to the development of small and medium-sized businesses
Fourth, large-scale investments and new jobs will be attracted to the city's economy at the expense of the state budget and private investors
All this will ultimately create conditions for improving the life of citizens
It is possible to solve such issues that impede the dynamic development of the Shymkent agglomeration
Agglomeration development depends mainly on the state of engineering and communication systems
In settlements adjacent to the regional center, this issue is sharper than in the city
In addition, due to the high inter-district traffic flow, part of the main roads is faulty
It is also necessary to reconstruct drinking electricity sewage systems in accordance with state standards
Taking into account these issues, the Plan of special measures for the development of the Shymkent agglomeration was approved at the regional level
It takes into account the following main issues:
Firstly, in connection with the transport infrastructure in the Shymkent agglomeration, it is planned to bring transport routes connecting the roads of adjacent settlements in the Ordabasa Sayram Tolebi Baidibek Tulkibas districts of the Kazygurt region to category 1 B
And the highway "Shymkent-Tashkent" is being reconstructed [9]
Secondly, the construction of a boiler house with a capacity of 160 Gkal with heat supply to the northern part of the city will begin in the development of energy
This year 700 million tenge will be allocated for construction of this project
tenge
Power "Bozaryk" 110 kW "Astana-12 power 220 kW
Construction of Sever substations is planned
Currently, it is planned to allocate funds from the republican budget for the development of design and estimate documentation for the Bozaryk substation with a capacity of 220 kW
Thirdly, in order to provide drinking water, it is planned to attract water sources to new microdistricts by blocking the north and south of the city with a main water pipeline
In 2013, the construction of a main water pipeline in the southern part was completed
This facility provides drinking water to 6 settlements
Construction of the northern water pipeline is planned to be put into operation this year
As a result, 6 settlements are connected to the source
Fourth, it is necessary to develop the construction of sewage networks
Currently, the central part of the city (microdistricts with multi-storey residential buildings), that is, only 42% of consumers are provided with sewage
New social service facilities in residential areas will use septics of residential buildings
In this regard, in order to develop the sewerage system, a feasibility study for the construction of new wastewater is being developed from the city budget.
The project involves the use of contaminated water for refining and watering plants
By 2017, the number of residents of Shymkent is expected to reach 1 million people
What conditions provide for the comfortable life of millions to ten people? Of course, we can talk about new school hospitals and other social facilities
Together with population growth, the need for social facilities will increase
In accordance with the General Plan of the city of Shymkent, approved by a resolution of the Government of the country of September 3, 2012, by 2025 it is planned to build general education schools in the field of education for 1365 thousand students (now 942 thousand places), the construction of preschool institutions for 1022 thousand places (now 221 thousand places)
In 2013, a socio-economic map was developed with an analysis of the socio-economic state of the city
This map provides a step-by-step solution of engineering and communication systems in 41 microdistricts abroad [10]
Another feature of the city of Shymkent is a developed business culture
The southern region is one of the green zones of the country and a large number of tourist attractions
Taking into account such values, the strategic goal is to develop the city by diversifying and modernizing the production industry with the maximum use of raw materials
In the future, the development of the city of Shymkent as a major scientific, cultural and tourist center of production, innovation and transport and logistics education is in the center of attention

In the global economy, the chemical industry is important, its products are currently used in the production of 96% of the consumed goods associated with all industries
Production complex based on processing of raw materials and materials, one of the leading branches of heavy industry in the whole chemical industry
In recent years, developing countries have been actively investing, creating conditions for the development of the chemical industry
In this regard, the development of the chemical industry is well established in our country
Chemical industry - Zhambyl region is one of the key manufacturing industries, the volume of which currently accounts for 256%
The chemical industry of the region is based on the production of phosphorus-containing products, including fertilizers, the production of phosphorus-containing raw materials
Chemical industry capacities not only compensate for the needs of the republic, but also have the opportunity to bring their products to the world market [1]
However, due to the current global crisis, due to a sharp decline in agricultural demand in mechanical engineering for yellow phosphorus products in the EU and lower prices for yellow phosphorus and mineral fertilizers (natural gas electricity), as well as rising prices for rail transportation, chemical production is declining
Analysis of the chemical industry of the region showed that in the industry the production of yellow phosphorus increased by 101%, nitric fertilizers - by 68%, phosphorus fertilizers - by 86%, phosphoric acid production decreased by 130%, sodium tripolyphosphate - by 181%
Today, the republic has established the production of phosphorus fertilizers from the country's largest phosphorus Karatau
Superphosphate plants of Kazakhstan and Central Asia operate on the basis of phosphorite base in Karatau
Of these, 6 are Taraz Superphosphate Plant
Kazphosphate LLP in this city is of great importance
the total chemical industry of the republic is 982%
Karatau phosphorite basin of the region has very large reserves of phosphate raw materials, unprecedented not only in our republic, but also in all CIS countries
The company produces 20 types of products, such as yellow phosphorus mineral fertilizers and nitrogen-phosphate fertilizers, and its products are delivered to countries near and far abroad, and the profit from this allows to increase the country's economy
Kazphosphate LLP includes such large-scale industries as the Mineral Fertilizers plant, which produces phospharite and processes the Karatau GPK and the Sholaktau fuel and energy complex New Zhambyl Phosphorus Plant
As you know, sulfuric acid is needed in the production of phosphorus fertilizers
The launch in Kazphosphat LLP of a new workshop for the production of sulfuric acid, which has no analogues in the country, contributes to the growth of the country's competitiveness in the world market, since its products are mainly aimed at export (export)
The project of the sulfuric acid production workshop was developed by the Russian OJSC NUIIF together with the Kazakhstani partnership KAZNIIKHIMPROEKT
The company produces sulfuric acid earlier in Uzbekistan and
the launch of a new workshop, which will be forced to withdraw from abroad, will replenish the economic portfolio of the region, reducing the cost of raw materials, agricultural producers will be covered by mineral fertilizers
In addition, in recent years, the company has developed a system for recycling furnace gas into production; production of food orthophosphoric acids; production of granular sodium tripolyphosphate; "Fosfa" a in the Czech Republic
"production of sodium hexametaphosphate; production of phosphorus sludge utilization; introduced a number of investment projects, such as the production of purification of yellow phosphorus from harmful organic additives
Implementation of these projects made it possible to improve the ecological situation of the city and the region, provide energy savings, create new jobs to reduce the cost of finished products and expand the range of products to reduce the cost of high value added products [2]
The further development of all types of infrastructure is important for the development of the chemical industry as part of industrial and innovative development
The achievements of the chemical industry in all industries in Kazakhstan determine the competitiveness of such industries as mechanical engineering, automotive industry, aircraft production, energy, forestry, light industry and agriculture
Kazphosphate is the largest producer of chemical products in the country, Khimprom EuroChem and others.
Eurochem (360 billion tenge ($2 billion)
UNITED STATES)
Growth of chemical industry will provide new jobs for prosperity and residents of Zhambyl region
For example, according to the forecast of the regional administration, the Taraz chemical park covers the population of about 2,400 jobs [3]
The development of the chemical industry in Kazakhstan is due to the fact that the metallurgical industry together with this industry uses substances isolated as an auxiliary product from metallurgical waste for raw materials
For example, sulphuric acid from by-gases produced by the Eastern Central and Southern Metallurgical Industries will be removed and transferred to the production of large phosphorus fertilizers in these regions.
According to economists "calculations, the cost of sulphuric acid produced from by-product metallurgical gases is twice as low as that produced from natural raw materials and 21 times lower than the size of corresponding funds per 1 ton of production [8]
Currently, the chemical industry implements investment projects using the potential to increase the added value of products while continuously working on the creation of new innovative and competitive industries, For example, Talas Investment Company Economic Zone Chemical Park Taraz Fundamental Projects EuroChimFertilizers and other major companies
Special economic zone "Taraz Chemical Park" by order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan (On the creation of a special economic zone "Taraz Chemical Park" 13)

Geographical location of the special economic zone "Taraz Chemical Park"
The purpose of creating a special economic zone is to create favorable conditions for the production of high-tech and competitive chemical products that convert goods from outside and are oriented towards the export of goods, as well as the development and support of the chemical industry through the use of modern environmentally friendly technologies with the involvement of leading world companies [4]
Special economic zone "Chemical park" Taraz "the first non-state management zone in Kazakhstan
This is Jurong Consultants Ltd of Singapore, which has best practices in chemical and technology parks in building infrastructure that meets the requirements of the world standard
his company became an international adviser
The main products produced in the special economic zone are salt deposits in the area of ​ ​ natural gas whey in the Karatau Makbel phosphorite basin and Zhanatas quartzite Shu-Sarysu and t.
it is provided
priority areas of the special economic zone "Taraz Chemical Park" a) production of chemical industry products; a) production of rubber and plastic products; b) production of other non-metallic mineral products; c) production of machines and equipment for chemical production
Currently, the pace of development of the chemical industry of the region shows good performance
In the future, the chemical industry will become the only leading industry that will promote the potential of the region's industry, so it provides comprehensive support from the state
More than 900 billion tenge of investments to be attracted to chemical industry of region till 2020
Such support from the state will give a new impetus to the development of the region's economy

In such a difficult political situation as now, the main task for our country is to perpetuate the political and territorial independence of Kazakhstan
This is a requirement of the time when our compatriots, together with the local population, participate in this ambitious task
Kazakhstan needs foreign Kazakhs in Kazakhstan
The state should be the first to begin to fulfill its duty to a generation and history
The Republic of Kazakhstan ranks ninth in the world in land area 2,724,900 square kilometers
The population according to the first September 2013 amounted to 17 million 75 thousand people and takes 61st place in the overall standings around the world
The population density is 63 people.
That is, the ratio 9:61 can be attributed to the negative proportional ratio 1:68
This disturbing form of communication
In addition, Kazakhstan has an important geopolitical position
The preservation and strengthening of national sovereignty in the same territorial-tense political and economic situation as it is now is an essential matter on the agenda [1]
Government plans to increase population to 25 million people by 2050
It is undeniable that this noble initiative contributes to the return of compatriots from abroad to the country
In total, there are 11 million Kazakhs worldwide, including 1 million 739 thousand Kazakhs, in the number of Kazakhs scattered in more than 40 countries 155-16
The annual growth of the modern population of Kazakhstan will be about 200 years for growth by 1 million people, counting 5 thousand people
Given that the total number of compatriots who returned to the country in 20 years is 1 million people, that is, a 5-year natural increase in the population of Kazakhstan with the arrival of compatriots called Oralmans, grew due to Oralmans.
In addition to the quantitative growth of compatriots, the development of the national language and culture will contribute to strengthening foreign policy and social ties to the prosperity of the economy and economy.
This problem can only be solved by studying scientific research
In this article, we describe the historical migration and geographical settlement of the Kazakhs of Turkey, which are one of the clusters of Kazakhs of the world
The root of the Kazakhs of Turkey originates from the Kazakhs of China
As some people write, Chinese Kazakhs are not descendants of the people who fled from the territory of modern Kazakhstan during the Soviet Union or in distant years for various historical and political-economic reasons.
Chinese Kazakhs are the parents of these lands
Of course, there was a conflict between Kazakhs sitting on two pages in different situations
Their habitats were part of the great Kazakh steppe
After the well-known Sino-Russian border agreement between the same people, two large countries came and severed the historical connection between them
Chinese Kazakhs had to endure various German taxes and insults of the sole government of China in Shingjan
Then, at the end of the 19th century, part of the tribes in the Altai Territory (some clans in Tarbagatai) moved from Altai to Kobda and east of Xinjiang
Then Gansu reached the Tibetan Territory
Here he, finding no leader, defeated all the poor and finally went to Turkish land, but stopped
Therefore, many Kazakhs in modern Turkey so got to their ancestors
Scientific journalist Dosan Baimold in his work "Bulletin of Truth" - "Vedomosti of Truth" - says that he did not see Kazakhs who traveled to Turkey: on the way to Taklamakan Bay, many days went without water
How many people have become a worldview
After that, he was forced to cross the Himalayan mountain in a shootout with Chinese troops
High surface began to die out due to lack of oxygen in the air
Uninterrupted construction of earthen tibets from the enemy coast to the foot of the earth
In India, many more people died due to abdominal disease, unable to withstand the climatic heat
Now the Kazakhs, who survived such a hell of life, reached the first 17-18 thousand Turkish lands in thousands of people [2]
"Suffer from Altai to Anatolia": "In the social conditions experienced between two great powers, such as the Soviet Union and the Chinese Empire, culture in East Turkestan is less than the Uyghur Kazakhs who were liberated from the outside world"
But their war would be impossible if they were away from a formidable China.
Therefore, there were two ways in front of them
Non-return from home land or travel abroad
Remaining in his homeland, he either surrenders or is completely inclined to slavery, admitting to the violence of the Chinese administration, "she wrote.
Due to the pressure of two states, Kazakhs become refugees and lead in each side
The group of Kazakhs who became refugees consists mainly of less great and younger representatives of the Kerey Naiman clan in modern Turkey
Representatives of the great and younger hundreds of immigrants who lived in the Altai territory of the Tarbagatai Ili district during the Jongar uprising of 1916 and the collectivization of the Soviet era are starving
from the consequences of such a policy
In general, Kazakhs saw the violence of the Chinese authorities and the Russian kingdom
Because of such a tough policy, they were forced to relocate to other external regions, wishing their country calm [3]
Paying attention to the long-awaited history of Kazakhs living in Turkey, we see that this street is a unique feat of Kazakhs on the way to freedom
They experienced some severe difficulties for freedom unconscious
Note that in the 1930s, in the East Turkestan Territory, owned by China, the governor of the Kuomintang government, Shyn-Shi-Sai, under the leadership of such Kazakh leaders as Elishan Taiji and Zeidai Taiji, fled outside their native land.
The ancestors of the Kazakhs of Turkey in the last century lived in the East Turkestan region under the leadership of East Kazakhstan and China
In 1864, when China and the Russian kingdom established the border, East Turkestan stayed away
Their ancestors after the 1930s went into a general two-time process due to political pressure and the persecution of Chinese governors in East Turkestan
The first street led by Elishan and Zlyak batyrs began in 1938
In 1941, Tibet arrived in India
Second street - ten years after the revolution of Mau Zydung
Under the leadership of Akim Kalibek Sultan Sharip Zuk-batyr, son of Kusayin Taizhi Dalelhan Janaltai, four people were killed
They settled in Kashmir in 1951 [4]
As you know, Kazakhs who moved from China to Tibet from India to Pakistan lived as refugees
Moreover, from the historical Homeland in Giract he cannot live and live in a foreign country.
India in 1938-1950
1,000 Kazakhs in 12 years reached 1,400 people
Therefore, the Kazakhs took on Turkey, thinking about no longer risking generations
In the same 1400 Kazakhs today will be enough for 25 thousand
They had to get to a place where religious language remains in one country
In this regard, Kazakh elders, including Husayyn taiji Sultansharip taiji Dalelkhan Janaltai Kalibek Hakim Omarbai Aksakal Kaben taiji Hasen batyr t
and decided to move from Pakistan
About this famous scientist M.
Mendykulova in her work: "
there were proposals in connection with the migration of Kazakhs
The second offer to move to the first Muslim country of Saudi Arabia is to move to Taiwan into the slavery of Chiang Kai-shek, who directly worked with some Kazakhs, in particular with Dalelhan Novaltai
The third offer is to go to the United States, that is, walk through the American ambassadors who helped avoid the oppression of the Chinese Communists
They received permission from the US authorities to host in California or Texas
Fourth offer - stay in India and Pakistan, fifth offer - move to Turkey
While the Aksakals said that Chinese expelled from the country cannot afford in Taiwan, the trip to the United States was too long to maintain our national identity in a religiously separate country.
Living in India and Pakistan without any documents, as well as visiting an Arab country with a hot unusual climate, which is getting worse every year.
The historical cultural bottom and language decide that one country of Turkey is prosperous, "he writes.
The reason for the call to the United States was that the Kazakhs safely delivered their consul in the city of Urumqi to the border with Tibet
Therefore, Kazakhs in Pakistan are urged to emigrate to the United States to educate children for free
On October 17, 1951, the East Turkestan Association of Kazakh Refugees was created in Peshawar, organizing the migration of Kazakhs from the Eliskhan batyr group to Turkey
The society will begin preparations for the preliminary compilation of a list of immigrants to Turkey
Thanks to the activities of the Association, 1,400 Kazakhs were taken into account, of which 1,150 were adults and about 400 children survived in 12 years of life in India and Pakistan
Kazakhstanis worked in the created society for the benefit of the people
Khalifa Altai, one of the members of the Society of Kazakh Refugees of East Turkestan, outlined the main goals of society
It says: "1
Require close transfer in connection with the move to Turkey with the country's main embassy in Karashad
Ambassadors to Turkey and Heads of Government of Turkey
make a request
With the Government of Pakistan, in which we live now, we have good ties and resolve issues related to this country
Conducting protective actions against various actions of the Embassy of Red China
Help until Pakistan arrives in India "
But the move to Turkey did not take place quickly
On March 13, 1952, the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkey adopted decision No. 3/14595 on allowing the resettlement of East Turkestan refugees and Kazakhs from India and Saudi Arabia to Turkey
Turkish President Jalel Bayar and 16 Turkish government ministers led by Prime Minister Adnan Menderes will sign a special document
On September 24, 1952, the first list of 102 Kazakh refugees was compiled with the invitation of the Turkish Government to stay in Turkey as an official immigrant
1952-1954 people from Pakistan 1400 Kashmir moved to one Turkish country for 350 years under a special agreement
After entering Turkey, they were delivered to their destinations for free
Kazakhov received then Prime Minister Adnan Menderes
Camps of three districts are temporarily distributed in them: Zeitinburun Serkezhi Tuzla
Kazakhs who arrived in Turkey received great support from the state
This is stated in the data:
"When we arrived in Turkey, we also had sunshine on the hill
The weather has improved without a hot week
Free free meals
Weaving began to teach professions such as blacksmithing
Turik language courses opened, and each person voluntarily adapted to a special profession
Analyzing the leadership of Kazakhs in Turkey and before, Abdiluakap Kara concludes: "Kazakhs moved to Turkey to a two-time process
The first street led by Elishan and Zlyak batyrs began in 1938
In 1941, Tibet arrived in India
Second street - ten years after the revolution of Mau Zydung
Under the leadership of akim Kalibek Sultansharip Zuk batyr, four people such as Kusayyn taiji Dalelkhan Zhanaltai
They settled in Kashmir in 1951
These two leaders simultaneously moved to Turkey
During a trip to India - Pakistan, nomads filed an application for the creation of the "East Turkestan Kazakh Refugee Society" and resettlement in Turkey on his behalf
Their application was adopted in March 1952
And he reached Turkey, escorting his leader
Kazakh migration in Turkey lasted from 1952 to 1954
Their total number was about 2 thousand people, "the report said.
So, according to the bulletin "Kazakh Turks in Europe" in 1953, 1,450 Kazakhs from India and Pakistan moved to Turkey
In published publications and data collected from countries on the financing of measures for the resettlement of Kazakh refugees from Pakistan, the Government of Kashmir and India recognizes all the costs of accommodating Kazakh refugees who are Muslim "muhajirs," that is, refugees
After that, about two thousand Kazakhs in India and Pakistan began to move to Turkey in 12 years 2
Thus, Kazakhs led by Kusain Taiji were the first of the Kazakhs to enter the Turkish country in September 1952
Some sources mention that in 1953, Kazakhs from Pakistan moved 8 groups of 3 ships to the Bay of Basra and then by train to Turkey
At first, they were located in such areas of Istanbul as Tuzla Zeitinburyn Serkedzhi
It is also reported that Kazakhs who moved to Turkey met the heads of the Turkish authorities in Istanbul and taught them the language of their culture and traditions for eight months
In the same period, the Kazakhs settled there those who allocated land in the Deueli Yahiyala region in the Kaysar region of Turkey
After that, another part of the backward street learned in a letter about the good condition of the Kazakh brothers in Turkey, and they saw that between 1953 and 1954, 675 families with 1850 inhabitants became part and settled on the lands of the Turkish brothers.
"In 1953, the resettlement of Kazakhs continued in 1954
Kazakhs led by the last in India Kalibek Akim arrived in Turkey in the spring of 1954
So, out of forty years on May 1952, 1954, all 1850 Kazakhs living in India and Pakistan moved to Turkey, "said Mansur Taiji
So, the first column of Kazakhs from Pakistan to Istanbul, which began in September 1952, as part of a group led by other leaders, arrived in Turkey before the spring of 1956
Turkish government welcomed Kazakhs
He tried to do everything possible to get them on their feet
Turkey lived for 5-6 years in those places where the state allocated its days to our Kazakh compatriots
But improving the conditions of the subsequent offensive and
a crowded shopping center began to arrive in Istanbul
There, our compatriots engage in craft trade, opening small factories and factories created collectively, improving the conditions for adaptation to local life
Another part of the Kazakhs of Turkey - Afghan Kazakhs from Iran
Citizens of the Adai clan who left the Atyrau Mangistau regions of Kazakhstan in the 1930s
In the 1980s, a large group of them fled from Iran to Turkey
But half of the brothers from Afghanistan and Iran do not have citizenship
That is, a Turkish passport has not been issued
Because they fled unofficial refugees on their own
Their dream is to get a Kazakh passport of citizenship of Kazakhstan
Dzhemeney: "Red paw from 1929 to 1933" passed through the territory of Turkmenistan from Mangystau, a small city on the salt border of Iran, the inhabitants of Gomishan and Sallak were Turkmen
These places are located on the western side of the "Turikmen Sahara" of Iranian land
Wide steppe, occupying mainly the north-north east of Iran "Turkmen Sugar"
Kazakhs moved through Turkmenistan under the name Mazandaran
Due to the greed of the campes and an artificial hunger strike, they tried to make small housing without relatives and fathers deprived of land
They failed to settle in one place
In case of adverse weather conditions, it was not possible to feed Kazakhs with cattle
Kazakh life without cattle
He often has to move from one place to another in search of a landscaped place, since he cannot immediately come to terms with agriculture and engage in agriculture, "he wrote.
Some Kazakhs moved from Iran to Turkey in the 1980s and engaged in leather entrepreneurship [5]
In 1972, the Turkish government, on the basis of a statement by the Kazakhs, granted them land in Istanbul for land redemption and construction
If our compatriots call this area "Kazakhkent," now it is behind the country
Yagna called "Gunesli" in Turkish means "Sun rays"
Kazakhs are somewhere concentrated in a generic sign or ancestral system with a long-standing ancestor
Therefore, on the territory of Kazakhkent lived the most naimans and kereys
Kazakhs in Turkey live in other parts of Istanbul
For example, Zeitinburun Kuchuk Chekmedji Safra is a sheep in Ornekteepeuds, but they always try to be together at gatherings, even being in separate regions [6]
At this stage, it is difficult to know exactly the number of Kazakhs living in Turkey
If the difference in the transmitted data reaches from 19,000 to 25,000, then at this stage the number of Kazakhs is announced in the amount of 10,000
Because the population in this country is not calculated by nationality, but by civil registration
We do not even know the official number in this state
On the one hand, the change of nationality in the passport prevents the Kazakhs from returning to their historical homeland at this stage, if they do not fully indicate the exact number of Kazakhs today
The above quantitative data are presented on the basis of the report conducted by the Kazakhs themselves
According to our data, at this stage their number does not reach 10,000 Kazakhs
We know that some of the reasons why they decreased from the first place are today in a state of life, returning to their historical homeland
As you know, the bulk of Kazakhs abroad moved in connection with the historical political events that took place in the country at one time
Today, in Turkey, 4,680 families (23,400 people) in and around Istanbul, in Salihly, Manisa Province, 100 (500 people) in the "Altai village" of Nide Province - 150 (750 people) in Izmir, 20 families (100 people) in Ankara, 20 families (about 100 people) in Konia, 30 families (150 people) and
total - about 25,000 representatives of the Kazakh diaspora
And also on some pages of the press: When we became leaders, 1,852 bloodthirsty came to Turkish soil.
Our brothers, far from Atazhurt, grew up in this country and currently there are about 20,000 Kazakhs
About 8,000 of them live in Istanbul
Currently, the Kazakhs of Turkey live in several cities
In size: 1
Manisada (200 families) 3
Nowhere (40 families) 4
families) 5
Izmirde (20 families) 6
Cognac (10 families) - indicates
For example, according to Vyborg Batyrshaul, the number of diaspora representatives in the Republic of Turkey in 2003 amounted to 19 thousand people
Reported 25,000 persons for 2005
The majority of Kazakhs (2,750 families) live on the shores of the Sea of ​ ​ Marmara in the Zeytinburun district of Istanbul, 120 families - on the shores of the Aegean Sea (Izmir province) about 80 families - in the province of Nowhere 60 families - in Ankara and other provinces [7]
Along with the strengthening of independence, sovereign Kazakhstan began to pay special attention to the Kazakh diaspora of far and near abroad
During the study of the Kazakh diaspora
the need to prevent complex trends of importance at the level of
How the Kazakhs moved to another state, their political and historical socio-economic situation today is little studied, including about the Kazakhs of Turkey
The number and areas of residence of our compatriots living in Turkey are diverse in each literature
The exact number is difficult to give due to the fact that no census is currently being conducted

The main goal of synthetic organic chemistry is the intensive development in medicine of primary research aimed at finding and obtaining domestic genuine and qualitatively biologically active substances that can be used as medicines, and in agriculture - as pesticides
Among the saturated derivatives of the nitrogen heterocycle worldwide, piperidine is most paid attention among the directions aimed at finding new drugs, since these are natural compounds: azasteroid alkaloids, neurotoxins and t.
forms the structural basis of the series
Azacyclan derivatives are of practical interest as a biologically active substance with a wide range of effects in order to obtain new drugs and agricultural preparations.
In this study related to the above, in order to synthesize potential pharmacological active compounds based on 1- (2-ethoxyethyl) -4-oxopiperidine (prosidol ketone), secondary and tertiary phenylacetylene alcohols were also synthesized by the corresponding ketoxime.
Reaction of excess cyclopanecarboxylic acid with N-etoksietilpiperidin-4-onnyң secondary and tertiary phenylacetylene alcohols and ketoxime of the latter leads to the formation of crystalline hydrochlorides of esters at a flow rate of 50-78%.
Construction of the obtained new compounds was determined on the basis of physicochemical methods (IK- 13C-microscopic NMR)

The article provides for an assessment of the spread of man-made emissions in the lower atmosphere
Distribution of concentration of pollutants in lower atmosphere in different directions and wind speeds was detected in production and sanitary protection zones of enterprises
Distribution of emissions of aerosol pollutants in atmospheric space is shown using the Pasquil-Gifford model
Distribution zones of toxic emissions into the atmosphere within a radius of 50 km have been obtained
It is possible to predict environmental pollution at different values of output power
Words: estimated atmospheric concentration factors chemical industry
Structure of ion exchange complex ionite Trilon B glycidyl methacrylate acrylonitrile cationite complex
Ion-exchange substances - ionites are often used in production in life
Aqueous solutions used in the production were poured into the steppes to a large amount and were in vain
They contain rare harmful compounds and various ions, albeit in small amounts [1 2]
Now they will be cleared of ionites
The effectiveness of this method with respect to other methods allows increasing the concentration of released ions
Purified water can be reused in production
For example, in the production of chromium paint, nickel is copper zinc, and in the production of artificial fiber, copper ions and radioactive ions are released [3]
The term "complexons" was proposed by University of Zurich professor Herold Schwarzenbach in 1945 for organic ligands in the polyamine acetic acid group, consisting of an imine-cyanide moiety interconnected by various aliphatic and aromatic radicals.
Then, a large number of similar compounds were synthesized.
instead of acetate groups - alkylphosphone alkylarsones
and alkylsulfone, and instead of nitrogen (III) - phosphorus (III) sulfur (II) selenium (II), polymers with tellurium (II) groups were synthesized
The exact similarity of the properties and structure of these ligands and polyimino-polysilicic acid led to the extension of the name of the complex to them
Complexons belong to characteristic-forming legands, and their complex compounds - to complexing
The main properties of complexes include the formation of complexes with metal ions in aqueous solutions
Its stability is usually very high, since the corresponding cation cannot be found using the classical analytics technique
The synthetic availability of complexes and complexes based on them and the wide possibilities of the modified structure of molecules make it possible to obtain compounds with predetermined properties
They can be used in solving problems of a specific national economy and for solving theoretical issues in coordination chemistry [4]
One of the main issues is the production of complex compounds with predetermined properties in coordination chemistry (with given resistance and selectivity to reaction with decomposition temperature and solubility of physical electrochemical and other parameters)
Complex compounds based on complexes have the greatest interest among these aspects
In connection with the need to increase the efficiency of sorption processes in various sciences and technology, the interest of scientists in selective ionites is growing every year
Creation of ligand molecule includes functional-analytical groups of heteroatoms of various complexing fragments into gelant system, hydroxyl groups with inhibitor-diacetate groups C and N heteroatomorphic nitroaminecarboxylic azo- and sulfotopes
Synthesis of complexes is carried out by various methods depending on their structure and reactivity of the initial components: carboxyaloidalkylcarboxylic acids and cyanomethylation of amines using the Mannich reaction of amino acids with corresponding halides, etc.
On the example of complexes of new and previously known aliphatic heterocyclic aromatic groups, the reaction of carboxymethylation of amines with monochloroacetic acid was investigated.
Due to the increase in the validity of the primary amine, an increase in the reaction rate was observed
The ability of the latter to react can be related to the possibility of independent exchange of one of its protons for the attacking group of carboxymethyl, which is in the protonated state during the reaction
With strong amines, the reaction medium has buffering properties, so that in the condensation of monochloroacetic acid there is no pronounced change in the pH of the solution
A study of the rate of sequential reactions with addition of carboxyl groups showed that the inclusion of the first group is the limit stage
Therefore, by this method, it is impossible to obtain not completely carboxyl amines
Such complexes with secondary ammintops (imine-acetic and imido-phosphonic acids) also show interest as a unified reagent for the synthesis of more complex complexes and polycomplexons
Synthesis of these simple ligands by oxidative decay of lower amines (thermal and electrochemical)
Interaction of imine-acetic acid and imido-dimethylenephosphonic acid with a compound with a moving halide atom and phenol by Mannich reaction is investigated
The latter reaction is widely used in the preparation of novel complexes based on polyphenols of the benzene group (hydroquinone pyrocatechin resorcinol and oxyhydroquinone derivatives) and other complex highly conjugated systems.
Systematic study of Mannich's reaction formed an opinion about his mechanism
The first reaction of formaldehyde and phenol is most likely, but the possibility of aminal formation from its repeated interaction with phenol is also taken into account [5]
EDTA (ethylenediamine tetrasiric acid)
The most characteristic compounds studied and widely used are EDTA NTF and OEDF, produced at the production facilities of various states from 200 names of complexes
EDTA - first set - also known by the following names: Trilon B set II versen helaton II sequestrol and t
As can be seen, the EDTA molecule has 4 acid and two base centers
The successful compatibility and mutual assistance of these two centers today is widely and differently functioning, ranks EDTA as one of the most efficient and universal complexes
X-ray construction and other research methods have shown that EDTA has a betaine (zwitterionic) structure
In an acidic solution, the cation EDTA - H5EDTA + and H6EDTA2 + is protonated, and in the main solution of the tetrabasic acid anion - EDTA4-
As can be seen from the Complex formula EDTA4 - anion is potentially decadent: coordination of four "carboxyl" and four
two nitrogen atoms and eight oxygen atoms, including "carbonyl"
However, the dentance cannot be higher than six - such is the spatial structure of the compound only so that two nitrogen atoms and four oxygen atoms of "carboxyl" can participate in the coordination
At the same time, five-point metallocycles are formed and lead to high stability of the complexonate
A distinctive feature of EDTA is its high flexibility and large-scale interatomic distance M-O and M-H in complexes of various metals, which frees up many geometric constraints and ensures the versatility of the complex
Alkali metal cations are complex formed with EDTA only in potent solutions and have low stability
Interaction of EDTA with cations of the second main group of Mendeleev periodic system constitutes soluble complexes in aqueous solutions from pH 40 to 120 in wide range [6]
Complex compounds of EDTA with variable metal cations are comprehensively and widely studied
3d- ekizaryd metal cations form stable soluble complexes with EDTA
The stability of the others with maximum stability in them is reduced as follows: Cu > Ni > Zn > > Co > Fe > Mn > Cr > V (lg b () = 127)
The middle of the IV period with oxidation state + 3 is ML-composite complexonates and their stability is 10 times higher than the stability of complexes of the same metals having oxidation state + 2
Cobalt (III) complex CoL-ethylenediaminetetraacetate with maximum thermal resistance inside lg = 407
A significant modification of the molecules of classical complexes is the replacement with a phosphonic group of carboxyl groups
the fragment has the form of a distorted tetrahedron and has a higher dentance than the carboxyl group having a flat density
More broadly described among complexes with phosphone groups - nitriltrimethylene phosphonic acid N (CH2PO3H2) 3 (NTF)
It dissolves well in water (up to 3 mol/l) and forms strong complexes
Like EDTA, it has a neutral structure
The exchange of carboxyl oxidation into a phosphone group leads to the stability of the complex
Of greatest interest are alkyl diphosphonic acids, which have high specificity in interaction with a number of important cations.
The most important representative of these acids is oxymethylenediphosphonic acid (CED), consisting of two phosphone groups and an oxyethyl group capable of forming a complex in a strong acidic medium.
Complexsson with almost all cations form permanent complexes, including alkali and alkaline earth metal cations
The stability of the beryl complex is different, which is 6 times more stable than the corresponding compounds of alkaline-earth metals [7]
Trilon B (disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetrasiric acid) - white crystalline ioncoagulant powder
It can be said that dissolution in water does not dissolve in alcohol and ether
The scheme of its functioning is based on the "pumping out" of metal ions of soluble metal salts and replacing them with sodium ion
Almost all trilon B salts dissolve in water and 1 trilon molecule, regardless of metal valence, reacts with 1 metal molecule
Its properties are widely used in analytics
Many cations form stable complex compounds
The main properties of trilon B include the formation of stable water-soluble complexes with alkali-earth metals in a wide pH range (from 2 to 135)
EDTA-bound metals remain in water but show less reactivity
Calcium cadmium forms water-soluble complexes in wide pH ranges with ions of copper zinc and manganese iron and other polyvalent metals
The gelate-like reaction is essentially temperature independent
Complex compounds of this type are stable, especially in alkaline medium and at high temperatures [8 9]
Practical section
Ionites - inorganic and inorganic substances insoluble in water, containing active (functional) groups and mobile ions
Ionites can replace moving ions with electrolyte ions in aqueous solution
Basic physicochemical properties of ionites: in most cases, the physical properties of ionite are not as important as the chemical properties
Synthesis of ionite consists of two steps (synthesis of the copolymer and modification of the obtained copolymer by Trilon B) and two methods (1)
modify the resulting copolymer and dissolve it in DMF with Trilon B; 2
and Modification of the synthesized copolymer by Trilon B in the same form)
For the production of ionite, first of all, a copolymer based on GMA and ACH is synthesized.

Summing up this work, a soluble copolymer based on GMA and ACH was first synthesized by initiation.
DMF is used as the most effective solvent of the obtained copolymer
Modified 900C-ta soluble copolymer with Trilon B based on GMA and ACH
The assumed formula of the resulting new ionite was recorded and captured in the IR spectrum.
As a result, a new complex of a carboxyl tertiary amino group of methyl cyanoxide and an unsaturated bond were found to be present.
Synthesis of environmental catalysts pheromones
Insecticides are often used to protect plants from pests
Insectiides not only destroy harmful insects, but also destroy many useful substances.
pollutes the environment, poisoning near the soil and water
As a result, plants and their embryos are poisoned to a certain extent, and then people and animals using them daily can be poisoned.
Stereotalgam catalytic hydrogen preparations are widely used in the production of pheromones and attractants of insect pests of plant substances
There are 3 main areas of application of pheromones in plant protection: trapping of male insects in order to monitor to reduce the population, mass trapping of male insects and deception (disorientation) in order to disrupt insect sexual communication [1]
In the synthesis of pheromones and other biologically active substances, the main part of the synthesis is the stereotalgam water supply of acetylene compounds to the corresponding cis-olefins
Acetylene derivatives for this: hydrocarbons alcohols aldehydes esters and t
it is used
Work on catalytic stereoselective hydrogen of acetylene derivatives, which are intermediates in the synthesis of pheromones "D
at the Sokolsky Institute of Catalysis and Electrochemistry "[2-6]
In the works, the authors investigated the reaction of stereotalgam hydrogen of several unsaturated acetylene compounds in catalysts of copper catalysts attached to the support and modified with oxides of European and yttrium of these catalysts
Dry, used as carriers in research
Processed NaOH
In order to increase the donor properties of catalysts in accordance with our work [7], a dry conveyor -Al2O3 2 N
Treated with NaOH and used as carrier of MgCO3 compound C
dried, mixed with ethanol solution amounts of yttrium nitrate according to calculations, heated to temperature, are subjected to and impregnated with the solution
Then as a result of a spill of solution on a deposit surface spirit solution of nitrate of copper spreads and Z7Z suspension at a temperature To in the magnetic mixer within 4 hours mixes up
The resulting precipitate was filtered and dried at 373 K.
On all modified copper catalysts, copper was 10% and the metal concentration of the modifier (Y) was 05-1%.
The modified catalysts produced were hot treated (heat treated) with air in a quartz pipe at a temperature of 2 K for 473 hours before entering the reaction, after which 623 hours of oxidation in a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 3 K were carried out.
The catalytic synthesis reaction of cis-olefin compounds from alkynes was investigated by statistical method based on the work [8]
The method is based on determining the speed and various parameters of hydrogen absorption during the closed-loop reaction.
Analysis of hexadecinol 9 production was carried out in the chromatograph "Color-530"
The detector, equipped with a chromatograph with a flame ionizing detective, is made of Pyrex glass of phase 04-101, pre-heat treatment in PFMS with an internal diameter of 50 m 025 mm.
The kinetic curves of hydrogen at 393K temperature and hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa in the presence of the obtained catalyst 9-hexadecin-1 are shown in Figure 1.
According to the results, it turned out that the reactions go to the end of 9- hexadecin-1-tin water solubility of 1% Y + 10% on the catalyst Cu/γ-Al2O3 at a high speed, the reaction ends in 15 minutes, and 075% + Y 10% Cu
/ γ-Al2O3 and 05% Y + 10% in the presence of Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts according to the reaction time 45 and lasts 120 time
An examination of the catalyst showed that in the catalysts used, 9-hexadecin -1- it is tastefully exchanged for cis-9-hexadecene-1 (Table 1)
9-hexadecin -1- in 1% Y + 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 and 075% Y + 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 in catalysts - 100% and 98% a Y + 10% in catalyst Cu/γ-Al2O3 - 97%
Maximum stereo frequency shows catalyst Cu/γ-Al2O3 1% Y + 10%
With 9-hexadecinol-1 hydrogen, the effect of the transporter on the activity and taste of the catalyst was considered (Table 2).
In 9-hexadecinol-1 hydrogen, catalysts were activated, fixed to the Al2O3 support by speed:
The state of stereotyped catalysts corresponds to their activity
5% trans-enol is formed in coal, and cis-enol - only 91% (Table 2)
In other carriers, 9-hexadecinol-1 has a different conversion to cis-enol, to MgCO3-enol 73%, and to γ-Al2O3 100%
Figure - 96% kinetic curves of 9-hexadecin-1-tin hydrogen in ethanol
MPa Table 1 - Hydrogenation of 9-hexadecinol-1 at pressure 393 Ka and 6 MPa of hydrogen
Table 2 - Water supply 9 hexadecinol-1 at 293 K 96% ethanol on various carriers
The introduction of yttrium oxide as a modifier contributes to the reduction of copper oxide to metal, respectively, increases the rate of hydrogen adsorption and catalyst activity
[9] noted that some modifiers positively affect the activity and taste of catalysts
Their role is based on donor transportation of e from mixture to metal
In our case in the manufacture of catalyst carrier 2 n
The prepared catalyst showed high activity and taste during processing NaOH
Complex composite hydroxides of Cu2O structure types are formed on modified catalysts with DEA after heat treatment.
The main effect of modifying the low frequency elements of these catalysts with oxides depends on whether the copper ions are Cu0
Most often, it occurs under conditions of strict hydrogen content (R-6-10MPa T-393-413K)
In the presence of yttrium oxide, a spillover effect occurs that increases catalyst activity

Keywords: cadmium chloride and renal epithelium experiment
In connection with anticorrosive optic-physical electrochemical photochemical properties, Cadmium spreads on average in wide agriculture, since technology is used in industry [1 2]
Compounds of heavy metals in areas under modern urbanization conditions are often chemical causes of ecological pathology
A number of researchers have studied the effects of cadmium compounds on the intestine and red chin in the liver [3 4 5]
Data on changes in the organizational structure of kidneys caused by exposure to cadmium chloride can be called little-studied
According to a number of researchers [6 7], 80% of cadmium enters the body through nutrition
Therefore, in our experience, we intend to study the effect of cadmium on the morphological organizational structure of the kidneys
Purpose of work: to identify disorders developed in the organizational structure of kidneys after chronic poisoning with cadmium chloride
Materials and Methods, Experiment weight 160-200 g
Done on 20 paternal rats belonging to the Wistar industry
Conducted at the Atshabarov Applied and Experimental Institute
As the study material, the kidneys of these animals were obtained
Cadmium chloride for chronic rat poisoning was used in creating an expert-mental model
Daily in the morning hours (8-9 hours) for 25 month, with the calculation of the weight of animals in kilograms, added 15 mg of cadmium chloride to the normal vivar diet
During the examination, we divided the animals into 2 groups: The second is the reception of cadmium chloride
A study of animals of all groups was carried out after a day after 25 months of constant poisoning with cadm chloride
Material obtained after decapitation of animals is fixed in Telesnitsky solution
During the day after the material was found on the fixer, we contained in alcohols with an increased concentration for its purification from water according to the conventional method of washing with waste water
After conducting intermediate processes (mixtures of xylene and paraffin from xylene from a mixture of equal amount of alcohol and xylene), the cut obtained from organs is covered with paraffin blocks with the addition of 5-6% pure wax
With the help of a microtome, paraffin sections are made and stained with hemotoxylin-eosin
Samples prepared using common methods
In the study of the renal structure of the control group rat, an externally streamlined fibrous welding capsule was shown.
In the study of the kidneys of animals of the control group, fibers separating the inner side of the penis from it, covered with a capsule consisting of kidneys, are released.
Kidney plastic substances consist of renal bodies and large-caliber nephron tubules
Longitudinal substances (pyramids) of the kidneys consist of vertical channels of nephrons and accumulation tubes, which are radially directed towards the ceiling of the pyramid
In the center of the body are blood vessels surrounded by rivets of the Shumlyansk-Bowmen capsule, consisting of a single-layer flat epithelium
The inner rivet of the capsule consists of podocytes that tightly adjoin the hemocapillars in the taps
Proximal tubulars do not have a clear reflection of the boundary between them, covered with cubic boundaries by epitheliocytes
Fibrous edges of epitheliocytes with a wide cavity of distal tubules are not clearly expressed, cytoplasms are light, so the intercellular border is well expressed
Kidney bodies in horizontal layer are uniformly arranged
Between cells covered by the accumulation tube with prismatic epithelium, cytoplasms are light and black in color
Tubes are directed into peninsula cavity, open towards pyramid ceiling and covered with transition epithelium
Cytoplasm of epithelium with tubule substrate with uniformly colored normochromic nuclei
Capillaries and cranes in solid and gray substances with focal completeness of the stroma without spontaneous
Large vessels in renal parenchyma with non-obvious completeness
This description indicates the normal fur structure of the kidneys
Examination of the organizational structure of the kidneys after 1 day after 25 months of cadmium chloride poisoning, uneven coating of the upper slope of the kidney
When creating a longitudinal cross section of hemorrhage in the formation and longitudinal parts of the kidneys
Also revealed an increase in the volume dimensions of the capsule
When examining a permanent preparation of the formation layer made from a transverse section of the kidneys of animals, the device of the renal tissue is not completely disturbed, but hemorrhages near the capsule
Capsule consisting of collagen and elastin fibers, sometimes packaged
With an uneven arrangement of kidney bodies in the formation layer, some vessels with dilated blood vessels show blood weakness in them
Revealed eosinophilic masses in the cavity of most of the distal tubules
The cavity of most proximal tubules is wide
The cytoplasm of the epithelium, lined with individuals, is not uniformly colored, mainly hypochromically sometimes dissolves
Capillaries and cranes in solid and longitudinal substances with focal completeness of the stroma
Large vessels in renal parenchyma crowded
The epithelium of the main exhaust channels is vacuolenic or slightly absorbed by the paint of the cytoplasm and nuclei subjected to dystrophy due to the accumulation of oil drops
It is not clear whether tubing fibers facing the abdominal side are reflected due to the fact that the tubing cavity narrows as a result of uneven swelling
Weak coloration of cytoplasms and nuclei of auxiliary tubers narrowed in internal cavities
Thus, the capsule in the kidney body is narrowed with cavities in the head and auxiliary exhaust channels with boiled blood capillaries
These indicators reflect the negative impact of cadmium chloride on the organizational structure of the kidneys
Change in the exchange of cadmium chloride, which is the basis of the vital activity of the cell structure based on the mechanism of exerting toxic effects on the body
During poisoning, morphological changes appeared both in renal bodies and in the capillary tap system
And with close contact of renal bodies with the hematopoietic system, blood is filtered in it during the metabolism caused by the reaction to toxin substances
The component of the genitourinary system performs many different functions, which are part of homeostasis and immune systems, important in renal activity - filters and detoxifies blood, controls the process of reabsorption, that is, conducts the process of digestion of amine acids and other substances necessary for the body [8]
Obtained data on changes in the organizational structure of kidneys in conditions of cadmic intoxication indicate a decrease in blood filtration and homeostasis
These changes mean that cadmium chloride has a toxic effect on the kidneys of animals, cannot fully perform the functions that cause changes in its organizational structure
Knowledge of the relative nature of the organizational structure of the kidneys in normal condition and chronic cadmium chloride poisoning made it possible to determine changes in the body and the degree of damage to the organizational structure of the kidneys
Morphological data obtained by us from the results of the study coincide with the data in the literature
For example, Wang H
According to [9], cadmium is a very toxic metal and claims impaired kidney function
Urination members ensure the stability of ion concentrations in other fluids in the body with blood composition (isoionium) and the stability of Ottoman blood pressure and other biological fluids (isosmia), the stability of base equilibrium with acids in the body (isohydria)
At the same time, volumetric stability (isovolemia) is maintained in blood vessels, which sequentially exchanges intracellular and external fluids
Regulates tubularity with renal vascular tone
As a result, blood pressure is maintained in relative equality
For example, in some people, due to impaired kidney function, long-term pressure rises to the limit, which leads to the development of renal hypertension [10]
Thus, chronic cadmium chloride poisoning has a toxic effect on the body and leads to a violation of its homeostasis, which can indicate changes occurring in the Bowman capsule and tubes located in the soft part of the kidney

In this article:
The characteristics of the Central Park of Culture and Recreation will be considered
The geographical location of the city and the formation of its climate are described
Climate of Almaty is continental
The circulation of mountain air flows is a factor in improving the climate, as well as the environmental situation, which is currently reduced
The environmental and climatic consequences of precipitation and snow cover of the year were analyzed
Almaty
upper rivers belong to the basin of Lake Balkhash
Main rivers of the city: Big Almaty and small Almaty and its regions
Due to the presence of rivers in the mountains, they are considered fire hazardous
The key role is played by the fact that the city is an urban environmental center, where special attention is paid to the description of the soil cover
In the mountainous part to al-Farabi Avenue there is a black earth, then gray and light red soils below, located to Rayymbek Avenue
Almaty

The current state of plants of the Central Garden of Culture and Recreation has not been studied
The state of tubular vegetation in the Central Garden of Culture and Recreation, as a landfill conducting breeding, should be paid attention to research by botanists
The report gives the basis for the need to study the tubular plants of the garden
The main words: physical, geographical and environmental situation in the city:
Words: ecosystem population - range of surface fauna
Currently, one of the most important issues in human life is the observation and restoration of an ecosystem that preserves the peace of blue animals and plants of nature.
Because the place of any resident of nature in the ecosystem is special
Therefore, it is necessary to work on their protection and preservation
And the performance of this work is a great task facing all human children
It can be proud that if our country is characterized by the latitude of mountain forests and a desert-desert steppe, which occupies a special place throughout the world in terms of land size, then in fauna and flora its windows are equal with other countries
Under Soviet rule, more than sixty mammals of animals caught more than one hundred and sixty birds, among these animals was one of the most important for the economy
Akbunken is one of the oldest salt tribes that have reached us
The secret of its preservation still depends on specific qualities
The reason for the use of the sacred words "horns" here, pantocrine inflammation of the lungs treats heart paralysis diseases, and "ashes of the hoof" writes from iron and ulcer on the body, "blood" due to the fact that herbaceous kanbite heals from a loose disease [1]
Akbunken - the class Mamalia (mammals) belongs to the family Covicorhia of the order Artiodactyla (pairs)
Of this genus - Saiga Gray (Bockender) relative Saiga taratarika (akbken or saik) and Saiga taratarica mongolica (Mangol akbuk), as well as Saiga tarisca prisca Saiga taratarika binagadensis Aliga arigtara orata.
Currently, only two previous species have disappeared
Akbokenningdenebigimat of sheep is intelligent
Chest height on average 134 cm (122-149) - 865 (73-98) - horn length 74 (63-80) cm, weight 29 (25-36) cm - 445 (35-56) kg, and adult goats length - 117 cm (108-127), chest
In the 1950s, in Kazakhstan, akbunken merged with each other with spraying, when their number in liquidated herds was quite important
At the same time, he specified the wintering and habitat of akbans in Kazakhstan
So, wintering grounds: the valley between the lakes Alakol Balkhash and Ilya-Karatal Aksu in the Arkalyk area of ​ ​ Ushkara-Arganaty vicinity Taukum chain Shu-Iletau Otar steppe Betpakdala Moyynkum vicinity Karatau along the Sarysu River
Zhailau between the northern shores of Zaysan, Shingisau and Mount Kalba, near the lakes Alakol Balkhash, between the lakes Ili-Karatal-Aksunzen, south of the Karkral Zhanaarka Turgai Irgiz, around the Shubar River, along the Embi River, on the Ustirt Bosach peninsula of the Caspian Sea ian Sea
Akbunken in 1950-1955 (the names of regions and districts at that time were called by the system) were found a lot in the following regions:
Kurchumsky district of East Kazakhstan region; Abay Ayagoz Shubartau district of Semipalatinsk region; in the Alakol Karatal district of the Taldykorgan region; in Balkhash Bakanas district of Almaty region; Kordai Shu Moyinkum Talas of the Sarysu district of Zhambyl region; Ulytau Zhezkazgan Konyrat Shet Nura Telmanovsky district of Karaganda region; in the Korgalzhynsky Yesil Atbasar Vishnevsky district of the Akmola region; in the Sozak district of the Shymkent region; in all districts of Kyzylorda region; Turgai Amangeldy Semiozer Taranovsky district of Kostanay region; Aktobe Guryev visited all districts of the West Kazakhstan region, that is, in 77 administrative districts of 13 regions of Kazakhstan, where it was possible to meet akbulens, another part of the akbulens crossed the southern border of the Guryev region, as well as in the Turkestan and Algabass regions of the Shymkent region in 1947-1952.
From the 80s - 90s of the XIX century, the akbukken range began to expand
It advanced significantly from north to south
The western northern and eastern boundary of the range of this animal at the moment can be carried out through the following points: Zhayykozeni-Oralkasy-Temirauly-Turgaikaly-Tengizkuli-Shingistau-Zaysan lake-lake-Molaly-Iliysk station
At this time, no such change occurred on the southern border of the Akbenken range
Winter Akboken met on the northeast coast of the Caspian Sea in Ustirta along the Syr Darya rivers Sarysu Shu Or Karatal only in deserted valleys near Alakol [2]
Akbunken currently lives on the land of Kazakhstan and Mongolia
Akbulkans in these places have not communicated with each other for a long time
Akboken range in Kazakhstan divided into three populations
Surface Urals and Betpakdala are classified as populations
By Decree of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 29 April 1999 (No. 527), due to a sharp decrease in the number of planned catches for use in the national economy, its catch was practically stopped until 1997.
The event took place on 19 July 2001 (No. 980)
"On additional measures for the protection and reproduction of Akbulken"
The Volga River and the Urals conditionally divide the territory of the Ural population of Kazakhstan into two
Akbunken estate on the right bank of the Volga Black Yar River (along the Volga River) - Lake Manych -
Valley between the city of Kizlyar (along the Terek River) on the left bank of the Volga River - akbunny oncoming zone - Kazakhstan
In Kazakhstan, akbunken live in the Ustirt plains of the Turan lowland and the Torgai steppe in the Zhanaark and Betpakdala Karatau regions, as well as in the interfluves of the Volga and Ural rivers
In administrative territory Ural Kyzylorda Zhezkazgan region in winter-summer, and Aktobe Karaganda - only in summer
The northern border of the Akboken settlement extends approximately from west to east to the villages of Zhonibek - Kaztalovka - Furmanov Karoba and the territory of Russia
In 1949-1950, the method of determining the number of acbulene using a car was used
In this method, counters cross the territory, somewhere in several places and record the number of aqualens encountered on the road at a distance of 1-15 km, as a result of which they detect an average density of location divided by the area of ​ ​ land in which the number of aqualens encountered is calculated
The total amount will be determined by increasing the result on the land area occupied by the shark in the same period
But this method did not satisfy the theoretical and practical requirements
Firstly, due to the fact that the surface of the earth is flat, the census is unfavorable, secondly, due to machine noise, it cannot but hang itself on the eyes, and thirdly, on tomorrow's day of yesterday's animal can be posted on the register.
Since 1954, the number of proteins in Kazakhstan began to be determined by the aircraft
In this case, accountants fly over the territory of Akbulen by plane at a speed of 100-125 kilometers per hour
crosses out the route to a special map and draws a schedule
In the aircraft, in addition to pilots, there are 4-5 accountants (four on board two sides and one person in the cockpit) during examination of animals by the person at the pilot or by pilots
"on the RH wing" "on the LH wing" gives a signal to accounts located on two sides
Each of the counters determines the amount of time (hours and minutes) of the meeting of the akbuk on board its side
If the census period corresponds to summer or autumn, then a graph in which juveniles are displayed is included in this table.
The first census data are accumulated on aircraft
The next stage of census work is the determination of the number of proteins from these materials
This work will not be performed until the counting is completed
For example, after leaving a certain point, one starboard counter at 11 hour 07 minute indicated the number of proteins in the pack that occur as "50," and told the second counter "45" or "60"
Because the speed of the aircraft does not allow you to consider the exact number of proteins accurate at different times
This is especially common when the number of proteins in the herd exceeds 30-40
The most important period of akbuken life in early May - lactation period
Most often they throw themselves into a bundle
Their lactation area does not exceed 50-100 square kilometers, even sometimes 20-25 thousand aqualens are thrown out for 10-15 square kilometers
The reason such proteins gather somewhere is because they often water grass on river banks, where water remains for some time, or in deserted places with snow
Because you can usually not tolerate when white-tailed goats that tolerate water (desert) than any wild animals throw
Does not tolerate deserts, especially when it begins to enter the field
That's why 3-4 days before birth, the herd is not disconnected from the right place
Due to the fact that the lactation process takes place during migration, the herd comes here one after another
As a result, a large cluster of proteins is formed [3]
The mental vision of the one lying in lactation turns around, looking around
So the first lag appeared
He will be very weak
With the birth of Lagi, the goat begins to hug his body
Because the birth rate compared to the uterus will go into a cold external environment
In addition, the wet body begins to dry out
The flag of the newborn mother is very necessary
As a result of the flag, the body of the young quickly dries up in the subcutaneous vessels. Blood intensifies, and the body of the varnish narrows
In addition, no one has more milk than any of those who care for the body with a maternal feeling, and someone, secondly, has the smell of varnish
This is the only prerequisite for quick detection of lacquer from another lacquer at a later time
Standing next to his varnish, AKBEK, moving further down the throat, now a second varnish is born
10-15 meters from the first camp he is thrown to the ground
Another pattern of adaptation to the natural environment
Because helpless varnish has many enemies
Due to isolation, one of the varnishes may remain alive
Of course, the animal sometimes gives birth to twins somewhere
But this is rare
The same as the nearby akbukken are grouped by 10-15
With fresh varnishing, goat often breastfeeds
Because young varnish works better a little more often than after 2-3 days, less often 5-6 times after 3-4 days breastfeeds 4-5 times
And this is the period when he took the most milk
For the rapid growth of varnish - rice will be very useful
half of the lacquer feed will be grass on days
In this case, the lacquer is impregnated 2-3 times a day
And at the end of July, goat varnish will stop breastfeeding
Due to the emptying of varnishes, acbulene also reduces the network
In August, white goats are watered
Protein contains 58% fat 58% lactose 331% defatted dry matter 101% and vitamins and minerals
Increased protein and fat content in milk promotes rapid maturation of young animals
Most of the akbuk of the Ural population is fertilized in the area of ​ ​ the village of Karoba, Kastalovsky district
Primary fertilization will begin from May 4 to 5, and the main fertilization will be held from May 9 to 15
When fertilizing protein, the weather will be very variable
From tomorrow it will be cloudy and rain
On some days, the rain will blow from morning to evening
In the region from May 9 to 15 cloudy with rain and cool winds
At the same time, when the Akbunkans hide their varnishes between the grasses and leave for pasture, by evening they find each other screaming
But at this time in the steppe many steppe eagles kill white varnishes and weak goats [4]
In April 2009, the Ministry of Forestry and Hunting together with the group "PO Okhotzooprom" and the Institute of Zoology of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan conducted an air census
Compared to the 2008 census (18300), the number of whitefish increased by 453%
It is especially noticeable that the Akbankens are concentrated in the northern direction and some of them cross the border near the borders of Russia
The main group of akbans during the air census was located in the interfluve of the Volga-Zhayyk River
As a result of the census, four separate names of aquulens met
As a result, in the total territory in 2014, the number of aqualens will be 26,600 heads
Akbunkenov in the West Kazakhstan region has a favorable climate, with an even relief (relief) of water
Aquulens also have pumps and corresponding areas capable of protecting themselves from strong blizzards and wolves and hunters
Weather in Uralsk is also favorable for aqualens
The average number of weather conditions in winter is 15-200C, the average rainfall in summer is + 20 + 220C
The fact that the number of endangered wild animals can even be increased and used effectively can be seen in the practice of increasing the number and using them for the benefit of the people [5]

Noise Pollution Noise The main source of vehicle pollution Human health
Noise (from a hygienic point of view) is a complex of continuously combining sounds of different frequency and intensity that adversely affect the human body
Noise (from an acoustic point of view) is small amplitude mechanical wave oscillations of parts of a dynamic medium arising under the influence of any arising force
Noise - a set of sounds of different frequency and intensity, constantly changing in time
A person needs 10-20 dB of noise so that normal life does not feel isolated from the world
Noise of the park or forest of these leaves [1]
The source of noise is any process that causes a local pressure change or mechanical fluctuations in solid liquid and gaseous media
Its impact on the human body is mainly due to the use of new high-performance equipment that mechanizes and automates labor processes
Presence of two natural and anthropogenic types of noise pollution (1 grey
Natural noise from natural conditions
This species has no harmful effect on living organisms, and sometimes even more pleasant than does not exceed the maximum permissible noise level
Noise intensity is only 2-10 dB
Anthropogenic noise - a type of noise pollution resulting from human actions
60 to 170 dB causes noise pollution
This species is an industrial transport and is divided into other
Figure 1
Types of noise pollution
In Kazakhstan, more than 30% of citizens are exposed to anthropogenic noise pollution
Most citizens believe that transport is the main source of noise pollution
Indeed, a third of the population experiences the negative impact of traffic noise, and 70-80% of urban residents live in acoustic discomfort
Noise pollution, especially in large cities, is always local, as numerous studies show, and gives rise to this by vehicles: urban rail and aviation
Already, on the main highways of major cities, the levels of balls exceed 90 dB and tend to have annual volatility, which is the greatest threat to both the environment and humans [2]
The development of technology and industrial production was accompanied by an increase in the level of noise affecting humans
We live here in the age of speeds used in the production of high-speed machines and units (engines pumps compressor turbine crusher centrifuges and other installations with moving parts)
The effect of noise on the body in production conditions is largely due to other negative effects: vibration with temperature deviations by poisonous substances and t
combined [3]
To retain sound, humans and animals have a special organism - hearing, which changes the oscillatory motion of the sound wave to certain feelings that our consciousness perceives
Scientists from many countries are currently conducting various studies to determine the impact of noise on human health
Their research shows that noise harms human health
But absolute calm and annoys a person
Prolonged exposure to noise on a person leads to damage to the central nervous system and disruption of normal heart function with increased blood pressure and intraocular pressure
The fact that strong balls have a harmful effect on humans will be observed sooner or later
2,000 years ago in China, prisoners were continuously exposed to drums and storms to death as punishment
Source ability to focus at noise power of 3 kW and frequency of 800 Hz is impaired
Noise power of 5-8 kW disrupts the skeletal muscle, which causes the loss of parallel memory
Noise power of about 200 kW leads to death
Therefore, in large cities it is forbidden to use solid and sudden signals
Stockings significantly reduce shrub trees that absorb noise
Therefore, green spaces are needed along roads with heavy road traffic
Calm significantly increases hearing ability
increased fatigue
reduced thought activity
reduced productivity
the development of cardiovascular disease
has a negative impact on the human body with nervous diseases
According to scientists, noise will reduce the life expectancy of a person in large cities by 8-12 years
In ancient China, countless people are punished with death by sound
Physical and biochemical adaptation of a person to noise is impossible
Severe noise is a physical drug for humans
Therefore, some people and, above all, young people, fond of modern music with a great intensity of her hearing, risk their health due to the effects of physical drugs on the body
Women become less resistant to stiff noises that lead them to neurasthenia faster
Bad household noises in the house, caused by poor sound insulation of apartments, destroy the nervous system of men
Man always lives in a world of sounds and noise
The sound is the mechanical oscillations of the environment received by the human hearing aid (from 16 to 20,000 vibrations per second)
Oscillations of high frequency by ultrasound are called less frequency oscillations of infra-sound
Noise - loud sounds combined into an awkward sound
For all living organisms, including humans, sound is one of the impacts of the environment
Loud sounds in nature rarely have relatively faint and prolonged noise
The combination of sound stimuli gives animals and humans the necessary time to assess their character and form a response
Sounds and noises of high power affect the hearing aid with nerve centers, can cause painful sensations and shock
This is how noise pollution affects
Prolonged noise, reducing sensitivity to sound, has an adverse effect on the auditory body
Liver disruption leads to irritation of nerve cells and great effort towards them
Weakened cells of the nervous system cannot accurately coordinate the work of various systems of the body
Hence the disruption of their work
Noise level is measured by units indicating the degree of sound pressure - decibels
This pressure cannot be perceived indefinitely
Noise level 20-30 decibels (dB) is almost harmless for humans, it is a natural background of noise
As for loud sounds, the permissible border is about 80 decibels
A sound containing 130 decibels begins to cause a person to feel sick, and a sound of 150 dB becomes unbearable
What was applied to death by "ringing flour" in the Middle Ages is not free
The buzz of the call slowly kills the convict
High level of industrial balls
In many works and noise production, it reaches 90- 110 decibels or more
In our house, where new sources of noise appear over time - household appliances, there is also not much peace
Even in ancient times, when people knew about its dangers, despite the fact that noise limitation rules were introduced in ancient cities, the effect of noise on the human body was not studied for a long time.
Each person takes the noise in different ways
Much depends on the temperament of a person's age in conditions surrounding health
Some people lose the ability to hear relatively low noise intensity on short-term exposure
Prolonged exposure to strong noise can not only negatively affect auditory ability, but also cause other harmful consequences - increased fatigue from headaches in the ears
Very noisy music of our time affects hearing, causing nervous diseases
Noise has a accumulating effect, that is, acoustic irritation exerts strong pressure on the nervous system, concentrating in the body
Therefore, before hearing loss from noise exposure, a functional disorder of the central nervous system occurs
Noise especially restrains the negative effects of the body on nervous mental disorders
The process of mental illness is higher among people working in noisy conditions than those working in normal sound conditions
Noises cause functional disorders of the cardiovascular system; has a detrimental effect on visual analyzers and vestibulation analyzers; reduces reflex work, which is largely the cause of accidents and injuries
Audible sounds, research shows, can also have harmful effects on human health
For example, all types of intellectual work affect the health of infrastructure: a person's mood worsens, sometimes there is a sense of fear of panic, and at high intensity there is the same feeling of weakness as after a strong nervous shock
Even weak sounds have a significant effect on a person, especially if they are long-lasting
probably
Scientists believe that many of the nervous diseases of residents of large cities cause, which are not heard through these thick walls
Ultrasonics, which occupy a significant place in the range of production balls, are also dangerous
The mechanisms of their effect on living organisms are very diverse
Especially strongly affected by cells of the nervous system
Noise becomes weak, its harmful effect on the body is made invisible
A person cannot be protected from noise in practice
Currently, we are talking about a noise disease that develops as a result of exposure to noise with damage to the hearing and nervous system
Sources: pollution of harmful substances in the atmosphere, fuels in which pollution of the road transport atmosphere burns
Air pollution occurs as a result of fuel combustion
The chemical composition of emissions also depends on the quality and type of fuel, production technology, combustion method on the engine and the technical state of transport
At low speed and "idle run" of the engine, the most unfavorable operating modes emit more harmful substances in the atmosphere than during the movement of vehicles
Engine technical condition has a direct impact on environmental emissions
Exhaust gases of carburetor type gasoline engine with incorrect switching system have carbon dioxide 2-3 times higher than limit amount [1]
Vehicles use mainly oil-derived fuel for their operation
The organic mass of oil fuel includes the following chemical elements: carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur
Non-combustible part of fuel consists of wet and mineral additives
The products of complete combustion of fuel are carbon dioxide steam and sulfur dioxide
As a result of incomplete combustion of fuel due to insufficient oxygen, odorous gas is released instead of carbon dioxide
The exhaust gases of the internal combustion engine contain about 200 components
Their life expectancy is from a few minutes to 4-5 years
Chemical composition and properties also combine them into groups depending on the nature of the effect on the human body [12]
First group
They include non-toxic substances: nitrogen oxygen hydrogen vapors of carbon dioxide and other natural constituents of atmospheric air
This group draws attention to carbon dioxide (CO2), at present its content inside the exhaust gases is not regulated, but the question of this is associated with the special role of CO2 in the phenomenon of "thermal effect"
Second group
This group includes only one substance - carbon monoxide or odor gas (CO) - odor and
products of incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels without color
Carbon monoxide air emits a large amount of heat with a burning flame and turns into carbon dioxide
Carbon monoxide has toxic properties
He has the ability to affect blood hemoglobin, that is, he produces carboxyhemoglobin without connection with oxygen
As a result, oxygen hunger occurs in the body with impaired gas exchange and leads to disruption of the functioning of the entire body system
In most cases, odor gas poisoning is allowed in furnaces with a faulty heating system in worn-out boilers and when heating the engine in a closed place
The nature of carbon oxide poisoning depends on the duration of exposure to its dose in the air and personal intake of a person
Mild levels of poisoning were observed due to signs such as human brain bruises
In severe trauma, human consciousness vaguely suppresses drowsiness
A very high level of odor gas (above 1%) leads to the disappearance of consciousness and death of a person
Third group
It consists mainly of nitrogen oxides NO - nitric oxide and NO2 - nitrogen dioxide
Gases generated in an internal combustion engine at 2800 ° C and 1MPa pressure
Nitric oxide - colorless gas does not interact with water and does not interact with slightly soluble acid and alkaline solutions
Nitrogen dioxide is easily oxidized with oxygen
Under normal atmospheric conditions, NO is completely converted to NO2 - a colorless gas with its own smell
It is heavier than air, therefore accumulates in wells in pits and poses a great danger during maintenance of vehicles
Nitrogen oxides are also dangerous for the human body from odor gas
The general nature of the effects varies depending on the presence of different nitrogen oxides
When nitrogen dioxide contacts the wet surface (up to wide mucous layers of the nose of the eye), nitric acid enters, irritating the mucous layer and affecting the alveolar flour of the lungs
At high concentrations of nitric oxide (0004- 0008%), swelling of asthma and lungs occurs
When breathing air with nitrogen oxide of high concentration, a person does not experience a negative impact
With prolonged exposure, people suffer from heart weakness and nervous system impairment with inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa to chronic dementia
Secondary interaction with nitrogen oxide is reflected in the appearance of nitrites in the human body and their penetration into the blood
This causes hemoglobin to turn into metagemoglobin, which leads to disruption of the heart
Nitrogen oxides negatively affect plants - nitrate solutions form in leaves
It is with this property that nitric oxide affects building materials and metal structures
In addition, nitrogen oxides are involved in the photochemical reaction in soil formation
Fourth group
This group includes various hydrocarbons, i.e. compounds of the type SxNu
From the exhaust gases there are carbohydrates of various homologous series: paraffin (alkanes) naphthenic (cyclans) and aromatic (benzenes) in total about 160 components
They are formed as a result of incomplete combustion of fuel on the engine
Not completely burnt carbohydrates contribute to the formation of white and blue smoke
This is due to the delay in ignition of the working mixture on the engine or at a low temperature in the combustion chamber
Carbohydrates are toxic and negatively affect the human cardiovascular system
Carbon compounds of exhaust gases have both toxic properties and carcinogenic effect
Carcinogens are substances that contribute to the appearance and development of cancer
Aromatic carbon - benz-a-piren C20H12 was released inside hydrocarbons with carcinogenic activity.
It dissolves in oils in various fluids and human blood serum
Benz-a-pyrene, accumulating to dangerous sizes in the human body, becomes the cause of a dangerous tumor
Carbon As a result of the action with nitrogen oxide under the influence of ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, new toxic products are formed - photooxidants (the main component of the nose)
The main component of the nose is ozone
Photooxidants also include nitrogen compounds with a gas odor
Photooxidants disrupt rubber products that disrupt the corrosion (corrosion) of metals and worsen the state of vision, which leads to an increase in lung and iron diseases in people who have a harmful effect on biologically active living organisms [3 4]
Fifth group
They are formed by aldehydes - organic compounds bound to a carbon radical
In exhaust gases, formaldehyde acrolein and acetic aldehyde, mainly belonging to the group
A large number of aldehydes is formed at a low engine combustion temperature, that is, during low-load operation of vehicles or during "idle mileage"
NSW formaldehyde - unpleasant colorless gas quickly dissolves in water heavier than air
It affects the mucous layer of a person through the respiratory tract and the central nervous system
Acrolein CH2 = CH-CH = O or acrylic acid - colorless toxic gas of fat origin
Affects the mucous membrane
CH3CHO vinegar aldehyde - gas with an unpleasant smell and toxic impact on a human body
Sixth group
Wow and t
dispersed parts (engine wear products, aerosol oils, various burn substances t
) refer to
State - black carbon solid formed by incomplete combustion and thermal decomposition of the carbon part of the fuel
It irritates the airways, although it does not pose an immediate threat to human health
Impairs vision on the road with long smoke behind the vehicle
The greater damage to the condition is the adsorption of benz-a-pyrene in its front part
In case of pure adsorption, it has a negative effect on the human body
Seventh Group
It consists of hydrogen sulfide - hydrogen sulfide anhydride, as well as inorganic gases
This is evident in the use of high-volume fuels
In particular, in diesel fuels, the sulfur content increases
Domestic oil fields are characterized by a high percentage of sulfur and sulfur compounds
Therefore, diesel fuel obtained from it using the old technology is characterized by a heavy fractional composition and is poorly purified from sulfur and paraffin compounds.
The amount of sulphur on diesel fuel according to the European model (Euro-3), launched in 2014, should not exceed 350 mk/kg, according to our Kazakh model - 500 mk/kg (Euro-2 parameters)
The presence of sulphur enhances the toxicity of exhaust gases and increases the amount of sulfur compounds in the air
Sulfuric compounds dissolve in water heavier than air with an acute odor
Irritates the mucous layers of the eyes of the nasal array of a person, as well as disrupts the exchange of carbon and protein in an increased amount (above 001%) - leads to poisoning of the body
Eighth Group
The constituents of this group include lead and its compounds
They are found in the exhaust gases of carburetor vehicles using ethyl gasoline containing an octane-increasing mixture
Defines the possibility of engine operation without detonation (subsequent ignition and rapid combustion of internal ignition)
Antidetonator - P-9 ethyl liquid is used as mixture increasing octane number
Gasoline with the addition of ethyl liquid will become ethyl
The ethyl liquid includes an antidetonator - tetraethyl corgan P (C2H5) 4-bromine ethyl -monokhlornaftalin antitumor - paraoxydiphenylamine and a dye-filler - gasoline B-70
With the combustion of ethyl gasoline, ethyl bromide and -monokhlornaftalin allow the removal of lead and its oxides from the combustion chamber, but at the same time they turn into steam
They, together with exhaust gases, enter the surrounding space near the side road [34]
About 50% of roadside lead emissions spread to the surface layer in the form of microwaves
The rest for several hours is in the air in aerosol, and then lands by the road
Lead accumulation in the roadside leads to pollution of ecosystems and makes the soil unsuitable for agricultural use [5 6]
Addition of P-9 mixture to gasoline increases its toxicity
On different brands of gasoline fuel, the percentage of additives varies
When determining grades of ethyl gasoline, they are painted with the addition of various dyes to the mixture
Non-oil gasoline fuel without painting (Table 1) [6]
Indicators of physicochemical properties of motor gasoline according to GOST 52660 (2011)
In developed countries of the world, restrictions on the consumption of ethyl gasoline have been initiated or completely limited
Still widely used in Kazakhstan and other CIS countries
The eight groups listed above are grouped according to their chemical composition and properties, as well as the nature of the effects on the human body
Negative impacts on ecosystems are divided into eight groups
not only the provided components of the engine exhaust gases, but also the carbonaceous fuel apply oils and various liquids
With a high probability of evaporation, especially when the temperature rises, fuel and fat vapor spreads in the air and has a negative effect on living organisms
Inadvertent or intentional discharges into the ground or water bodies occur at gas stations and vehicle filling stations
In place of oil spots for a long time, the plant does not grow
Also, oil products entering the reservoir lead to the indigenous destruction of flora and fauna
Based on the above data, the definable features of mobile sources of pollution (vehicles) can be formulated as follows:
high intensity of growth in the number of vehicles compared to the increase in the number of stationary sources;
their spatial distribution (cars spread throughout the territory and create a common high pollution background);
proximity to areas with residential buildings (motorists fill local driveways and courtyards of residential buildings as much as possible);
Too high a toxicity of vehicle emissions compared to emissions from stationary sources;
complexity of technical execution of pollution protection devices at mobile sources;
as a result of the low location of the source of pollution from the surface of the earth, the exhaust gases of vehicles accumulate in the breathing area of ​ ​ people and are less likely to spread by wind compared to emissions from production sites
These features of mobile sources lead to the emergence of vast areas that constantly exceed the sanitary and hygienic standards of air pollution inside the city by road
High pollution by exhaust gases of vehicles is observed in Almaty South Kazakhstan Akmola and Central Kazakhstan regions of Kazakhstan
In these territories, motor transport accounts for 60-70% of the total emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere, including, according to the Department of Environmental Protection and Water Resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Almaty - 85% in Shymkent - 75% in Astana - 58%
The assessment made for the working set of vehicles showed that in Kazakhstan as a whole, 1 million tons of harmful substances are released from vehicles to the atmosphere per year, including in the East Kazakhstan region 22314 thousand tons in Central Kazakhstan 1868 thousand tons in North Kazakhstan 3632 thousand tons of harmful substances in South Kazakhstan region in the amount of 415 thousand tons [78]
Along with the high specific gravity of cars with carburetor engines in most of Kazakhstan, the widespread use of leaded gasoline determines the pollution of the atmosphere with lead compounds
Total lead release to the atmosphere in Kazakhstan in 2013 amounted to 2297 thousand tons
High lead emissions in Kazakhstan are observed in East Kazakhstan Almaty Central Kazakhstan and South Kazakhstan regions [8]
At a high level, carbon evaporation of gasoline occurs, from which the atmosphere is contaminated by moving sources of vehicles with exhaust gases exiting through the engine exhaust system of vehicles, as well as in small quantities with crankcase gases exiting through the engine crankcase ventilation system, and during fuel filling and operation of the engine power system (tank carburetor filter pipeline)
In exhaust gases, vehicles with carburetor engines consist of toxic components - nitrogen oxide of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and in diesel gases - nitrogen oxides from carbon and sulfur compounds
One vehicle as an exhaust gas with an average of 4 tons of oxygen from the atmosphere per year produces 800 kg of odor gas of 40 kg of nitric oxide and 200 kg of various hydrocarbons [9]
Automotive companies producing foreign machines pay attention to reducing the toxicity and neutralization of exhaust gases and constantly carry out work on technical improvement in this direction
In general, environmental safety on the part of vehicles consists only in compliance with environmental standards and non-acceptance of harmful environmental impact
not only from carrying out actions, but most importantly - improving the performance of vehicles and improving the processes and tasks used mainly in the transportation process, as well as repair and technical
increased and due to services
Therefore, in order to maintain environmental safety on vehicles, it is necessary to correctly carry out the design and technical measures implemented in the mobile part of vehicles (reducing the weight of the transport structure and reducing the movement of resistance, reducing the toxicity of liquid gases, using environmentally friendly fuels, using electricity and increasing the economic efficiency of the engine)

Summary
Kazakh National Pedagogical University named after Professor Abay
"Prevention of smoking among adolescents"
The article will address the issues of smoking among adolescents
Adolescence is very specific both physiologically and socially
Intensive growth and puberty are distinguished by psychophysiological manifestations, developing in that a certain psychological calm and sentiment in addition to their desire for adulthood manifest themselves as adults in front of their victims
Usually during this period, there is a desire for actions that involve young people in creating various risks or emergencies as a result of assessing their capabilities to experience.
Harmful habits are formed in adolescents under the influence of certain social and individual changes
Prevention of adolescent smoking should begin when these children do not have stereotypical patterns, attitudes and thinking
While dependence on the smell of tobacco and smoke has not yet developed, you need to start running
Prevention of smoking in adolescents is not only the fight against nicotine addiction, but also the preservation of the health of the entire population and an increase in the life expectancy of the population
Parents with a high priority in tobacco prevention among children
But parents cannot provide the necessary help in the prevention of smoking due to low qualifications or experience
The media (NSR) also have little consideration of youth health programs with a certain reference cost, unfortunately
However, it should also be borne in mind that preventive work with adolescents about tobacco has a special place
The earlier in the article campaigning and studying tobacco smoking for all people, the more fruitful their prevention will be
Black words: prevention of smoking of children and adolescents with nicotine addiction
Nodal words: Talas River
Kyrgyz ridges of agroland shaf
Geoecology Clay climatic hydrothermal humidification black earth landscape
Talas - a river in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan with a length of 661 km, a catchment area of ​ ​ 52,700 km ²
Passes through the territory of Kazakhstan through the gorge Gate between the mountains of Ishkeletau and Aktau
Length of the roadway of Kazakhstan 453 km
It flows mainly through the land of Bayzak Talas Sarysu district of Zhambyl region
The Talas River is the second most important river in the region
The river basin extends from southeast to northwest of the region
The Karakol and Ushkosh rivers flowing from the glaciers of the Talas Alatau and Kyrgyz Alatau begin from the confluence and flow into the sand, not reaching Lake Aydyn in Moyynkum
The width of the narrow gorge in the upper part of the hangar is 1-2 km, in the lower part it is wide 25-30 km
Perennial ice is filled with rainwater
Transports in June-August
In the lower reaches of the city of Taraz, several branches of Talas (Shalki Kndeli Tasaryk t.
) distributed
Water is suitable for fresh drinking water in spring and autumn
The average annual water flow in the area of ​ ​ the city of Taraz is 274 m/s ³
On the river 10 km from the city of Taraz, 197 km from the mouth of the Kirov dam, 275 km from Yubileiny, 280 km from Zhinali, Kazakhbay dams and the Talas-Asa canal were built
The low humidity of the atmosphere in the region is caused by the fact that the Kyrgyz Ogem and the Karatau ridge impede the flow of air
In the Talas massif, the pattern of air heat spread during the summer months, characteristic of the rivers of Central Asia, is stable, but their upward trend towards the south continues
The degree of natural humidification is especially high due to the fact that the value of heat evaporation in winter is reduced by radiation flow, that is, less than the value of its humidity relative to precipitation of that period [1]
The Talas River feeds mainly on highland snow and glaciers
In addition, he takes water from meltwater and rain in the plane, and in the lower part - from groundwater
Therefore, the climate of the Talas steppe, especially its flat part, is hot and continental, as this is due to the location of the territory in the area of ​ ​ high pressure air inflow
Under the influence of high air pressure and tropical air flows from the South in summer during winter leads to clear and dry weather
The Talas region from the northeast is blocked by the Talas ridges with the Kyrgyz ridges and its Ichekele-Too ridges, bearing moisture from the southwestern direction
Therefore, in the lowland zone of the region and on the slopes at an altitude of 3000 m, compared with other regions of the Shui region, less precipitation falls
Only in the highlands of the Talas region the amount of precipitation reaches 1000 mm or more
The maximum amount of annual rainfall (about 1000 mm) is observed on the high ridges of the Kyrgyz and Talas Alatau, and the minimum amount in the lower reaches of the Talas River, in particular in Betpakdal, is 170-200 mm [23]
The vegetation and soil cover of the Talas region is largely diverse, and desert and desert landscapes characteristic of lowland zones and intermounts in mountain high-altitude zones exchange hayfields with subalpine and alpine hayfields
Desert and desert steppe (Jazeera) are widespread in the flat flat part of the Talas region and are found in intermountain depressions
The main plant system of this zone is characterized by the predominance of plants such as crown and brain, and is rare in some places
There are desert gray soils with a light mechanical composition characteristic of this plant system, and without preserving algae
They do not have a stable composition, but have high throughput
Soil of nearby areas of high-fertility groundwater is saline [1]
Common gray soils at altitudes between 500-600 and 900 m in the Talas region form a regional soil system
They are located mainly on proluvial and deluvial clay and crushed stone deposits of different depths
They are characterized by the presence of a carbonate composition and a composition of low-frequency irregularities
Clay-brown and gray-clay soils are found near groundwater and are widespread in swamps of desert and desert zones of the Talas region
These soils are characterized by high fertility and a stable component
In the zone of absolute altitude 900-1100 m in the Talas region there are steppe and hay-steppe landscapes
Earlier, wormwood-ephemeral semi-desert plants grew here, and in the eastern part of this region at an absolute altitude of 1500-1600 - field plants
Gray soils characteristic of a simple northern zone with weak carbonate are common in this belt, which are characterized by the fineness of the scheme of a fine granular layer, the mechanical composition is mainly moderate clay and sand dust with light clay
Their composition is from November 15-28 01-015 g of nitrogen from 012-025% of phosphorus to 23-30% of potassium, weak alkaline reaction pH = 80-82
In addition to gray soils, meadow-brown and meadow soils are found in the upper belts of the Talas region
These soils are characterized by a high content of karachyric and a total supply of potassium nitrogen phosphorus
In the upper mountain zone of the Talas region at the foot of the mountain above the gentle desert strip - the Tipchak decree, there is a steppe zone on the slopes
They pass to mountain ranges with tipchak-steppe forests and herring forests or algae with subalpine meadows
And from an absolute height of 3200-4000 m, alkaline meadows begin, which border with rocks and glaciers
In the Talas region, above a strip of gray soils are belts of light purple and purple soils that cover mountain ranges and exchange in poles for 1000-1600 m of dry soils
Carbonates of open violet soils are formed in tension clays, which in mechanical composition more often become moderately swamp
Carachyric content varies from 20 to 35, total nitrogen 015-20% phosphorus 016 -020% potassium 02-25%
Poor alkalinity of soil solution
The Talas region is important for the development of sectors of the national economy, including livestock and crop production
Landscape systems in most of the region were used as pastures for livestock and crop production
Total land area used by field system 1
of which 208 ha
thousands
watering arable land
The irrigated arable land system is located in the system of landscapes of arid zones in the middle and lower reaches of the river
The dynamic development of irrigated crops in the arid regions of the Talas region forced the rivers to make changes to the natural hydrological order to use its water resources for wide agricultural needs
As a result of these complex changes, only the hydrological order of the river was changed, which led to a decrease in water flows in the lower reaches, as well as significant changes in the vegetation world and the direction of soil development of the landscape system, closely related to them not only with contamination with toxic chemicals
Uses physical-geographical climatic natural-soil and landscape zoning to assess the degree of the natural system's need for social exploitation and parity planning for the deployment of production forces
For comprehensive consideration of assessment of natural-ecological productivity of the natural system
Mustafayev proposed to divide into three main groups:
combination of climatic-biologically active air heat with rainfall of frost-free period and photosynthetic radiation of solar power;
indicator of agroklimatno-hydrothermal moistening, moistening indicator, extent of moistening, sign of a drought, indicator of a drought and assessment of moistening;
Ecological state of natural-ecological soil in the region changes in the geological turnover of water in the soil changes in solar power, at which biological productivity of soils will be unprofitable for soil development, indicator of weather comfort and landscape productivity [56]
Agrolandscapes protecting the natural system should also include water bodies, as part of the hermographic environment
A lake system should be used to reduce sewage discharges to the river system
At the same time, the volume of sewage water discharged into the lake system should not exceed 10 percent of the volume of water in the lake [7]
Thus, it is necessary to determine the possibility of trailer of natural and cultural landscapes to ensure their formation in balance conditions and functioning at natural and technical pressure to preserve natural stability and landscape balance
As a result of anthropogenic (man-made agricultural) actions in Central Asia, including in the Talas river massif, there was an intensive formation of new natural-man-made systems
Overuse (water use ratio 1) by regulating water resources in the study area (reuse of water in the riverbed)
50) has led to issues of protection and efficient use of natural resources of river massifs
In river masses, there is a tendency to disturb the balance between landscape components and, as a result, the degradation of the natural system began to proceed intensively, which led to an infringement of environmental sustainability
Since the search for ways to preserve this stability by assessing the patterns of hydrological hydrochemical biological change that ensures environmental stability is a matter of concern, the scientific justification for the use of river massif resources by comprehensively substantiating the amount of natural and technical load descended on them is a current and current issue.

General model for the formation of the chemical concept "Basic types of chemical reactions" Article on the compilation of the model in the formation of the chemical concept "Basic types of chemical reactions"
for
The author believes that the traditional method does not sufficiently use the principle of clarity in the formation of the chemical concept "Basic types of chemical reactions" among students
The task of forming a general model of the course of the main types of chemical reactions is an independent methodological interest
It was noted that the use of a clear set of conditional figures allows introducing game elements into the learning process, as well as using conditional geometric figures, explaining concepts such as allotropy to students
The author also proposes to use the palm suggested in health instead of indicating a free line in explaining valence in chemistry training
Keywords: models of chemical reaction types, equation formulas, student formation methods, chemical elements

Think in terms of the medium-term learning plan for new approaches
Head of State N.
Nazarbayev at the III Congress of Education and Science Workers: "The new generation of teachers should be much higher than the level of education
To do this, you need a teacher of a new formation "
At the same time, pedagogical abilities, distinguished by developed spiritual and creative pedagogical talent and professional competence, only teachers with high organizational ability and innovation constantly create conditions for the development of the student as a person
Currently, the main task of the teacher is to form an open discussion that students show a deep understanding of substantive knowledge and a critical mindset of interest in actively finding the ability to use them in the right place.
In this case, the proposed article will focus on a deeper understanding by teachers of interactive methods of teaching biology
The results of the current experience show that today in the education system "Education and training are carried out only through interaction based on active interaction [1 7-b]
That is why the basis of the educational process should be interactive methods, each teacher should use interactive tools and techniques in their methodology.
Since the concept of "interactive learning/learning" has a broad meaning, its methodology can be seen in numerous learning/learning systems
Among them M.
J. Dzhanpeisova "Modular Learning Technologies"
Karaev and J
One can attribute Kobdikov's "Three-Dimensional Methodological System" and other projects and programs [2 p. 11]
However, we provided examples of many ideas and methods of the project "Developing critical thinking with reading and writing" for young teachers with little experience in this article, and this article emphasized how interactive methods can be applied in the educational process, switching from the traditional curriculum to the medium-term curriculum.
With a common interactive method:
- Close relations between students and teachers are established;
relations are formed when students discuss a given question and try to find a solution to it;
it is important here that students try to find a solution to the problem than answer
Because the main goal of interactive training is to think about students yourself
Teach to find answers
Medium-term session on the relationship between the above-mentioned students and students
when drawing up a plan, you can see the actions of teachers and students on the lessons
That is, in order to teach students how to work with modern information tools in a textbook, advice was given aimed at teaching them a reflex report in order to listen to each other, analyze the data obtained and draw conclusions, support each other's decision and connect the knowledge gained with life
The article gives medium-term plans as an example
Depending on the assessment of each teacher's knowledge when entering into a dialogue with students or students in their practice, the teacher can modify and improve this medium-term plan if possible.

The system of environmental education in secondary school can be divided into three main links: the primary link of the middle level of the upper level
In the field of worldview for the primary level (grades 1-4), along with simple knowledge about the surrounding medium-earth air layers of nature, combining them in protection will contribute to the further development of the student's natural science
For the middle generation (grades 5-8), the subject of ecology is complicated in this section by the body's habitat and average factors should be scientific for their adaptation by organisms
Senior students (grades 9-11) receive environmental knowledge in biology by fully familiarizing themselves with their relationship with the biological age structure
In addition, senior students need to explain the importance of the applied ecology of ecosystem biocene biogeocene landscapes and the fact that various gases emitted from the production of harmful effects of fertilizers on the environment enter the air as acid precipitates when interacting with water droplets
In the section "Ecology," a general environmental framework should be established for the initial views of the atmosphere hydrosphere on biosphere pollution and measures taken to eliminate it [1]
In order to increase the interest of students in classes and strengthen knowledge in connection with the decrease in motivation for classes during this period, the KVN press conference of competitions, included in the discussion, partially research activities

Structure and boundaries of the biosphere
The role of the spread of living organisms in the biosphere
The activities of the biosphere are important
The biosphere is the life layer of planet Earth in which living organisms live
For the first time, the term "biosphete" was accepted into science in 1803.
Lamarck entered
However, it has not been used in science for a long time
Australian geologist E
Süss later (1944
) Russian scientist V.
After the opening of the Vernadsky exercise on the biosphere, widespread implementation began
Vernadsky in his work noted that "the future of the universe develops depending on the mind of mankind."
The scientist tried to show that the stability of the biosphere directly depends on humanity
The biosphere consists of three layers: atmospheric-gas hydrosphere - water and lithosphere - solid layer
The boundary of the biosphere includes the lower layer of the atmosphere in the upper part of the hydrosphere and lithosphere:
The atmosphere is restricted to the ozone layer at an altitude of 20-25 km;
lithosphere to a depth of 35-75 km
the hydrosphere will reach a depth of 10-11 km
These biosphere boundaries determine the following abiotic factors: lack of oxygen; low or high temperature; increased pressure
Based on these factors, B
Vernadsky defined: "The biosphere is a thermodynamic layer with a temperature from + 50 ° C to -50 ° C"
Note! Recent scientific achievements determine whether it is possible to meet inhabitants deeper than the above boundaries, but this layer is considered a life-friendly layer
Atmosphere - the gas layer of life consists mainly of oxygen and nitrogen
In addition to these gases, it contains 003% SO2-nің and ozone
These things are important to life:
oxygen is necessary for the respiratory process;
- participates in mineralization of poisonous organic substances important in photosynthesis;
ozone layer protects the surface from harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation
Hydrosphere - the water layer of life occupies 70% of the Earth's surface
Soluble oxygen and CO2 dioxide in water are important
They change depending on the vital activities of living organisms
Lithosphere is considered a soil layer of vital activity [2]
The biosphere is composed of the following substances:
living matter - living organisms (plants, fungi
) totality;
biogenic substance - substances formed as a result of the life of organisms (oil
) totality;
inorganic substance - substances (volcanic rocks) formed without the participation of living organisms; biomineral substance - substances formed in relation to living organisms and processes of a dead nature
(soil ton
Information on the distribution of living organisms in the biosphere:
living organisms are unevenly distributed in the biosphere;
life activity is concentrated on the Earth mainly on the soil and upper layers of the ocean;
at altitudes and depths of low-growth layers
The living matter of the biosphere is only 001-002% of its dead matter
Despite this ratio, it plays a key role in geochemical processes
Living organisms get the substances and energy they need from the environment
10% of biomass is rebuilt annually
The main activity of the biosphere is to ensure the circulation of substances contained in it
This activity will be carried out through the treatment of living organisms
Natural turnover of the substance:
carbon turnover;
nitrogen turnover;
phosphorus turnover
Water evaporates, which covers in the form of acid-alkali rains and destroys rocks, making the soil surface uninhabitable;
Water rotation is an important water turnover between the ocean and land
Carbon turnover
As a result of the participation of carbon in the photosynthesis process, vital oxygen is released into the atmosphere
Nitrogen turnover
Nitrogen nitrogen bacteria with atmospheric nitrogen are introduced into the soil in such a way that they can use plants, increasing the total nitrogen supply in them
Thus, nitrogen turns from soil to plant into protein, and after killing plant life - into amiac
Thus, a complex turnover of nitrogen occurs
Phosphorus turnover
Phosphorus is concentrated mainly in sedimentary layers
When used as fertilizer, the plant uses only a small part of it
The remaining part will enter the sea again and will be resumed
Most phosphorus is extracted along with fish caught from circulation
At the same time it is made of rocks
Due to the turnover of substances in the biosphere, its stability will remain

Test tasks to determine the correct order on the topic "Diversity of living organisms"
This article describes the test tasks of determining the correct order on the topic "Diversity of living organisms"
Assign test jobs to determine the correct order of action
Check of formation in the circuit
It is necessary to give instructions on such tasks: to determine the correct order
Tasks name and their main elements are given in arbitrary sequence
A quadrangle is placed next to each element, in which the student writes a digit, which is a sequence of numerical actions
With one error, the answer is considered incorrect
Testing and evaluation of learners' knowledge is the most important part of the educational process, the purpose of which is to determine the volume of students' knowledge on the strength and degree of knowledge of practical skills of remembering, self-awareness and application of knowledge obtained in practice
Extensive pedagogical testing with different forms of knowledge testing and evaluation to test and evaluate students' knowledge
In pedagogical experience, when applying test form tasks, the teacher established that the psychological burden on the student is minimal, since the student's knowledge is objectively assessed independently of the teacher, the knowledge of all students in the class simultaneously covers the test, and the time of its conduct is reduced by several times
Of several test job forms, 4 types are most compatible
Closed Jobs 2
Compliance Tasks 3
Right Order 4 Tasks
Open Jobs
Most tests are closed jobs that give jobs and one correct answer from multiple answers
Test tasks for determining the correct order are often not compiled
This article provides examples of test tasks to determine the correct order on the topic "Diversity of living organisms"

Geography of the economy - a historically established field of training in the system of social reproduction on a certain territorial border
Starting nest of an economic structure - an enterprise (organization) that provides services for the production of products or performs other functions
Production occupies a leading place, but the content of the national economy is not depleted by production, only a complex variable turnover of material goods begins in production
After production, there are multilateral processes for the conversion (exchange) of these material benefits, which are part of the system of public labor, their distribution and redistribution.
The population's consumption of material goods (as services) serves as a basis for updating their variable turnover in the structure of the national economy, since consumption is a means of constantly restoring the labor force
Globalization of the world economy In a market economy, the accession of the state to a competitive country will be based on the integrated development of the economy
Creation of clusters providing for the development of one of the most important areas of today - the combination of main production with auxiliary enterprises
No country in the world market has paid much attention to the formation of clusters in advanced economies after the possibility of not being competitive at the same time in all sectors of its economy was proved
In this regard, it became necessary to systematically form clusters around target industries
The motives for their formation: globalization and the trans-nationalization of the world economy are caused by increased competition in domestic and foreign markets [1]
The modern definition of the cluster is American economist M.
Proposed by Porter
In his opinion, the cluster is a group of geographically related interconnected companies (manufacturers of suppliers and others) and related organizations that function and complement each other in a specific area (infrastructure companies of public administration bodies of educational institutions)
He will formulate the idea that a country's competitiveness should be considered through a cluster of firms in various fields, adapted to the effective application of domestic procedures, and not to the competitiveness of private firms
Studying the competitiveness of various firms, he drew attention to the fact that highly competitive firms have the property of concentrating in a particular territory without scattered location in the territory
That is, when one or more firms achieve competitiveness in the world market, they exert their influence on suppliers and competitors and form the basis of a cluster of research and production complex and regional production policy [2]
About twenty definitions of the cluster are presented in the works of foreign authors on research
M, who have continued research in this direction
Enright worked to further deepen local regional concentration advantages, which have close relationships with the network of interconnected enterprises and increase their competitiveness from the process of cooperation and competition with each other
He spoke about the historical prerequisites for the development of regional economies, analyzed various cultures of doing business and introduced the concept of a "regional cluster"
In other words, "industrial cluster" means the geographical agglomeration of firms in closely related industries
Given the multilateral understanding and essence of the cluster definition in the domestic and foreign scientific literature, that is, analyzing these definitions, the goal of combining companies as they consolidate in geographical unity is that they need innovative ideas for producing competitive products
In this regard, it becomes necessary to create innovative programs
Based on the generalized wording, in our opinion, the definition of a cluster can be defined as follows: economic relations of cluster members and organizations competing with an innovative development program in order to increase the competitiveness of the region
Here, as a region, the unions of the country and countries of the region are considered [3]
Cluster is the definition of one of the methods of self-organization of society, adapted to preserve life, having withstood the stringent requirements of world competition
This means that science is the medical psychology of computer science mathematical physics and
With what is found in the industry, its meaning gives the idea that the "cluster" is a cumulative grouping in translation from the common English language
In the economic sector, the "cluster" - the recipient of leading positions in the international division of labor and competitive companies and groups of enterprises in various interconnected areas, receiving favorable conditions due to the close location in the zone reflecting economic specialization, provide a competitive position in the sectoral national world market
The cluster value from this definition represents a collection of companies located in the same or close to each other zone
In our opinion, the main producers and consumers connected by the process chain and visible in comparable sectoral phenomena form a cluster of production complexes formed on the basis of the territorial concentration of special supply systems
On its basis, production costs for "copying" production will be reduced, the motives of the cluster association are not allowed: increasing the possibility of attracting new technologies, activating regions of the regions, training specialists to support imports and exports and improving their skills, and the goal is to produce competitive goods and services [4]
In the course of training in the geography of the economy, each branch of the economy should be competitive depending on the market economy
In this regard, it has been investigated that common clusters can influence the competitiveness of industries in three areas:
Clusters increase the production of firms and industries: competition performs effective specialization within the cluster, The emergence of consumers with a high level of specialization makes it possible to apply large-scale economy in the production process, i.e. joint acquisition of raw materials or conducting marketing research allows technology suppliers to use specialized labor, information about business services, etc.
improving the logistics chain with a high level of expertise for free use, as well as facilitating the process of joint work and training (improvement) in the cluster, improving the infrastructure of cluster development of professional financial and other services
Clusters open up opportunities for innovative and productive growth: the creation of effective joint channels in order to find new potential resources for innovation - the formation of favorable preconditions for the distribution of risks, the creation of favorable conditions that predetermine and imply technological processes that lead to the emergence of a previously absent combination of specialization (ability)
Clusters simplify and stimulate the formation of a new business that supports innovation and expands the cluster: the development of fast-growing companies and the development of venture capital in water contribute to the emergence of complementary communication technologies and channels within the cluster, complementary technologies, the presence of complementary skills in the company facilitates participation in large contracts in which private enterprises cannot be competitive, support for the emergence of new participants contributes to the emergence of a new idea and business
strengthening social and other formal ties; Open the path to modern information flows within the cluster
Paying attention to the properties and main areas of benefits of the cluster, two ways of its formation are identified:
sudden occurrence (or spontaneous)
This path is very effective, but very rarely takes a long time and directly depends on the level of development of the economy
Informed formation through specific industrial policies
In this case, an in-depth analysis of the economic situation, the identification of opportunities for intersectoral relations, on the basis of which measures will be taken to implement the cluster project [5]
But the cluster mechanism, according to some economists, is only a spatial and organizational factor that increases the competitiveness of production, which serves only as an application of factors of production that create the primary necessary basis for competitive production [6]
By the logic of creating a cluster structure, clusters are created by using large enterprises as masts or by integrating independent small enterprises
In our opinion, the production of cluster products based on professions, participation in tourism clusters of which had priorities for real economic indicators among small and medium-sized businesses, will remain effective and competitive relations [7]
Business tourism has great potential for growth and rapid success
Inbound tourism contributes to the development of auxiliary industries such as the hotel and restaurant business and the source of foreign currency inflows into the country
The development of the tourism cluster will ensure the availability of a large number of jobs in various regions of the country
As the tourism industry grows in the world, Kazakhstan has real market opportunities in the following areas: ethnographic tourism - ecotourism - adventure tourism congress tourism religious tourism agrotourism hunting and fishing tourism
there are opportunities for the development of industries
According to these parameters, the study of industries equalized the 23 most competitive industries and auxiliary sectors of the economy
The tourist potential of our country is located in the very center of Eurasia and has unique opportunities, which are very diverse for the development of all types of tourism
The difference between the nature of each region of the republic and historical and cultural monuments in connection with climatic changes significantly affects the preparation of their own projects for the development of the industry in this regard for consideration by the cluster agreement
It is worth noting that, for example, South Kazakhstan (Almaty Zhambyl OKO, Kyzylorda region) is a zone of ancient history and culture with famous monuments of medieval architecture (Aisha Bibi Karakhan Baba Khatun mausoleum in Turkestan complex Khoja Ahmet Yassaui and others) in Zhetysu region (Almaty
In addition, the region has unique climatic opportunities for relaxing and hunting skiing and mountain climbing West Kazakhstan (Aktobe Atyrau region) - Ural in the Caspian Sea basin at the intersection of Europe and Asia
Here are the famous limestone rocks of the Karakiyan depression below 132 m above sea level, which are the second deep point of the planet
Land rich in fishing for fishing enthusiasts has favorable conditions for the development of water sports
Natural climatic conditions of the region - North Kazakhstan (Kostanay North Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions), in which historical places associated with Kazakh ravines have scientific significance, create favorable opportunities for various types of tourist recreation - motor transport cycling water
Resorts of Kokshetau Bayan-aul Moyyldy will receive recreational recreation, reserves Korgalzhyn and Nauryzym will become attractive for fans of scientific tourism
In Central Kazakhstan (Karaganda region) there is one of the largest lakes in the world - Lake Balkhash, Karkaraly mountain-forest valley
Archaeological and ethnographic sites of Olke are rich in preserved memorabilia
East Kazakhstan is Altai and its mountainous forested areas Irtysh river of Lake Zaysan Markakol Alakol Sauyshan
The zone is very rich in green and water and is very diverse
The appearance in the homeland of the great Kazakh enlightener Abay Kunanbayev of the famous writer Mukhtar Auezov arouses interest among tourists
Nevertheless, the development of the competitive advantage of the tourism cluster in each region has the following possibilities: business tourism seminars as they participate in conferences and others; ecological tourism is distinguished by the landscape of the zone and the presence of wildlife; cultural and educational tourism aimed at the discovery of historical and archaeological heritage and cultural heritage
related to the development of livestock tourism
Taking into account these opportunities in the development of cluster policy in each region of Kazakhstan, the following issues should be resolved: improving the regulatory framework for entrepreneurial activity in the field of tourism, improving the quality of tourism services by improving the system of standardization and certification in the framework of the provision of cooperation services with foreign and other cities; improvement of the system of training and development of specialists in the field of tourism, creation of favorable conditions for lending and investment of the tourist-hotel complex and infrastructure, ensuring security with the unification of state commercial and public tourism organizations organizing and controlling the tourist route; allocation of places for the development of tourist sports clubs for children and youth tourism, including urban district and courtyard, through the restoration of school tourism at city and district stations; Organization of tourism and recreation investment project fairs to identify funding priorities from various sources; Adjustment of activities between the concerned public executive and other bodies, as well as the State and the private sector;
Finally, in order to increase the competitiveness of the tourism industry, agreeing on the need for adequate public policies based on natural resource bases, the scope of its intervention in the tourism industry should include large-scale measures
Such measures include the possibility of protection against various risks (pollution of the environment, the presence of predatory animals, not poisoning by poisonous insects and plants), not exceeding the number of tourists in natural areas

Visiting balneological tourism 1-2 categories - tourist approach - sports tourism
The focus of active mountain tourism differs from many activities of other tourism
In this regard, one of the most important practical tasks in many types of tourism is the creation of camping programs and optimal directions
Requires the creation of the principles of route technologies, especially for traditional types of tourism, since it does not need to create the same directions for all types of tourism
On the territory of Kazakhstan there are several mountain zones convenient for active tourist mountain trips of various complexity categories
These are parts of the Western North Central Tien Shan Altai and the Dzungar mountain region
In tourist and geographical literature, within the framework of the western Tien Shan, Chatkal Chandalash connects with the Talas Alatau Range through the Pisky Mandaytal Ogem mountain ranges with the intermountain depressions of Fergana and Atoinak
Mountain hikes of medium complexity can be organized along the Western Tien Shan mountain range
In these mountain zones, it is difficult to build third-category mountain hiking trails
But conducting complex mountain trips of category 1-2 on these mountain ranges meets all the requirements
Tourism in a wide range includes many types of most sustainable (balneological tourism ski recreation) and oriented (tourism tourism aimed at nature, cognitive tourism) activities
In this regard, the creation of the optimal direction in active sports and mountain tourism is necessary not only to improve and get impressions, but also to ensure the safety of tourists in mountain conditions.
Due to the nature of the voluntary organization of a tourist trip, sports tourism is characterized by a steam character
The availability of convenient forms and institutional mechanisms for active mountain and sports tourism contributes to the sustainable and rapid development of these activities.
That is, the results of the organization will be reflected in connection with the great experience and business skills of tourist travel
One of such methodological results enabling the development of mountain tourism is geography orientation, improvement of work with a map and compos is due to each tourist group [1]
Sports tourism in the system of multi-level tourism is a symbiosis of geography and sports in its features and significance
He notes that the presence of interest in environmental knowledge covers a large space and depends on the geographical factors of the camping program of tourism technologies
Its symbolism and content belong to the classic type of tourism from the point of view of society
The nature of targeted activity, in which theoretical and practical actions in sports and mountain tourism have become different at the present stage, can be useful for types of tourism with similar positions in relation to tourist equipment and transport
New concepts, such as environmentally active nature-oriented tourism, are close to sports tourism
There are many similarities between school children's and youth tourism in the training category and concepts
The above types of tourism will be closely related to geographical science, adhering to the rules of sports tourism
Methodologically, it is necessary to analyze the belonging of mountain and sports tourism to the system of geographical sciences and its relation to geographical qualifications and determine it
The geography of sports tourism includes recreational geography on a small scale
In particular, mountain and sports tourism will choose extreme places for people in the natural environment
For sporting trips in mountains located at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level, recreational activities are considered suitable
The famous scientist in the field of tourism Professor S.
According to Erdauletov, "sports tourism is based on the principles of socio-economic and physical geography associated with their orientation to nature"
Also M
According to Trofimov, "sports tourism is included in the applied sections of geography and geography"
This is one of the categories adopted in geographical science, allowing to focus on mountain tourism
Concept of "territorial recreational system"
In the study of many tourist phenomena and trends, this formulation is of great importance for the development of mountain tourism, aimed at linking various elements to the space, such as tourist resource bases and route grids during hiking [2]
Natural conditions are reflected in the geographical patterns of distribution and territorial organization of mountain and sports tourism, as well as in the tactical model of technical means and trips
Because many campaigns are made in the highlands around a densely populated region, as in the suburbs of Almaty
Each territory is distinguished by hemorphological climatic high-altitude infrastructural political ethnographic and other features
In this regard, for each territory there will be convenient aesthetically attractive types of travel, allowing them to be classified according to different parameters
Therefore, in each area you can imagine several optimally active mountain trips that are considered suitable for a three-tourist trip
The most suitable way of these mountain trips is to provide any individual or several types of tourism
The category of difficulty suitable for such tourism, providing the possibility of spreading throughout the tourist area, will also be valid
In accordance with these Rules, scientists studying mountain tourism, on the basis of organized expeditionary research and travel, propose a periodic method for assessing the opportunities for the development of territorial sports and active mountain tourism, depending on the complexity of the tourist trip.
It will allow you to choose the most convenient types of tourism that correspond to the category of complexity of the tourist route, suitable for organizing attractive and active mountain hikes
The presented understanding of good camping types of sports and active mountain tourism determines the types of tourism that are most favorable and safe for each territory and allow you to geographically detail the area
A hiking chain suitable for mountain tourism should pass through sights passing on both sides of the main diving ridge and popular tourist attractions with a safe complexity of no more than the established standard for range and duration
In turn, the Route Form Program in this area should reflect the features of attractiveness, the possibility of providing transport with a combination of natural barriers
The direction of active mountain tourism determines the geographical knowledge of the category of development of tourist methods, the requirements for travellers in this territory
This method of risk management in sports and mountain tourism will ensure safe activity of tourist recreation [4]

Diversification of city-forming enterprises - a model for the development of measures of state support for economic diversification
Introduction
Issues of human resources development and territorial efficient organization of the economy in the modern world are closely related to cities
Cities where the most important achievements of human development are concentrated have a great influence on the socio-economic situation of the country, not only the settlements around them, but also the region
For researchers, on the one hand, the role of cities in territorial development, on the other hand, is the most important study of the legality of life and economic development of the most complex natural and technological system
Famous scientist Edvar Gleiser [110b] in his scientific works rated the city as an environment that makes humanity happy, and the former mayor of the city of Denver (Colorado) B
Webb: "The 19th century became the century of the empire
At that time, the empire determined the prospects for the development of the entire planet
The 20th century is the century of the nation-state
Then it was important to develop the national state
And the 21st century - the era of cities [2] "
Tilek Cettamar [3 84b]: "The wave of globalization has pushed for a competitive and innovation strategy in a global environment
In recent years, the world has paid attention to the development of cities as innovative centers
The role of cities in the formation of a regional innovation center is much higher, "he said
That is, the study of the sustainable development of urbanized territories is the main requirement of our time
According to the Statistics Agency of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan [4] (01)
) of the country's population (total population 174 million
people) 566% live in urbanized territories, that is, in urban areas
168% of this population is settled in 27 single-industry towns approved by the Program for the development of single-industry towns of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2012-2020 [5]
The impact of the financial and economic crisis in the country - the weakening of the economy of single-industry towns has caused an aggravation of the social situation over the years of Kazakhstan's independence
As a result, for the sustainable socio-economic development of single-industry towns in the medium and long term, "
development programmes "
The functional services of the 27 cities covered by the Programme are based on the production and processing of raw materials [6 18-24 bb]
One of the single-industry cities of the Program, depending on the activities of city-forming enterprises - the city of Zhezkazgan
Zhezkazgan is one of the territories of the central region of the Republic of Kazakhstan, where important centers of non-ferrous metallurgy with powerful industrial potential are located, on which the centers of educational culture are concentrated
The territory of the city of Zhezkazgan can be described as a single territorial and industrial complex specializing in the field of non-ferrous metallurgy, which is a collection of natural resources and production facilities determined by certain features
The foundation of the city was laid in the era of industrialization, which began in the II half of the XX century. (1954
) was founded by
The main feature of this city is its direct dependence on factors of specialization in the system of placement of production
Usually, one or more enterprises operate in such cities, affecting the standard of living of the local population on a final basis
It was these cities that were called single-industry cities or single-industry cities, that is, cities with a one-sided specialized economic base
These cities are characterized by a close connection with a large city-forming enterprise, which usually affects the functioning of the urban settlement and all important aspects of the life of the city.
Usually these cities experience huge difficulties in their development due to specialization in the development of one industry
In order to increase the competitiveness of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the development of territories with such a long-established industrial structure is extremely important
Therefore, there is a need to systematically study the issues of reconstruction of the development model with effective use of the spatial advantage of diversifying the city's economy in order to ensure stable osindustrial development of the city
Baseline data and study methods
American sociologist E
Toffler [7 257b] in his work The Third Wave said: "Information and knowledge become the main strategic resources
This, first of all, will lead to serious changes in the territorial deployment of production forces
If in the pre-industrial period cities appear at the junctions of trade routes, then in the industrial era - near sources of raw materials and energy, and in the post-industrial era - near scientific centers and large research centers "
The formation of single-industry towns during the analysis of world and domestic experience corresponds to the industrial period
For example, in the experience of developed countries Tennant Creek Woodcaters (Australia) Flint Birmingham Youngstown (USA) Kamaishi (Japan) Ostrava (Czech Republic) and t
cities have developed near raw materials and energy sources [8 257-460 bb]
Over time, various factors (raw material depletion, global financial and economic crisis
) the economy of these cities was depressed
The effective use of the conditions of geographical location of economic diversification is due to the fact that as a result of the effective implementation of strategic plans, cities are in an innovative direction (innovation and business center, transport and logistics center
) began to develop
From the country's single-industry towns (Zhezkazgan Tekeli Saran Zhanaozen and
) the period of formation corresponds to the era of industrialization
Unlike the model of development of small cities only in developed countries, the dependence on the activities of the still city-forming enterprise is not to diversify the economy, not to determine the model of post-industrial development
D significant scientific papers and concepts on the sustainable development of single-industry towns in the vicinity of raw materials and energy sources
Nurlanova was reflected in her work
The results obtained during the systematic analysis of foreign and domestic works served as the basis for the analysis of the modern state of the Zhezkazgan single-industry town, determining the model of post-industrial development
In the case study, carried out on the basis of fundamental research works on the topic: "Creating a conceptual basis for effective models of the sustainable development of single-industry towns of Kazakhstan" (using the example of the cities of Tekeli and Zhezkazgan)
systematic analytical methods of geographical forecasting and mapping of systematic geoinformation
The results of chamber research during a scientific expedition to Zhezkazgan were also used
The difference between single-industry cities and other multifunctional economic cities in changing the external environment depends on the change in state goals to the position of sectors of the economy so that payment conditions are controlled by the volatility of demand for market conditions in the foreign market
depends more on changes
If the changes are adverse, some cities will face particularly difficult social and economic issues
The result of these skirmishes - an increase in unemployment, a deterioration in social status, in short, will cause the city to be depressed
The practice of developed countries implemented an innovative direction of development through the restructuring of the completed functional activities of the city
Taking into account these practices, a comparative geographical method of analyzing the modern state of the Zhezkazgan single-industry town was used
Department of Statistics of Karaganda region in 2010-2014
As per data [9] analysis of atmospheric air condition is performed
During the analysis and processing of samples taken from stationary control posts in the city of Kazgidromet RGP [10], a comparative assessment of the degree of atmospheric pollution was given
During the research expedition, the main enterprises for environmental pollution and units for the creation of an industrial belt in the city of Zhezkazgan were identified
The results of the analysis of the systematization of geological and environmental information obtained as a result of research work served as the basis for the compilation of a map of zoning of industrial enterprises of the city
Results and discussion
The largest center of non-ferrous metallurgy - the city of Zhezkazgan is located in the central part of Kazakhstan, in the lower reaches of Karakengir - one of the largest sectors of the Sarysu River in the south-west of Saryarka
The nature of the city of Zhezkazgan is characterized by the features of the natural landscapes of the desert zone
Terrain at an altitude of 300-400 m above sea level flat-steppe flat-hilly
The very origin of the name of the city is directly related to production
Copper tin iron silver alloys of the Middle Ages and ancient mines with their processed remains were discovered from this territory
The development of the world's largest copper ore served as the basis for the formation of the name of the city
The name of the city is made of the words "copper" and "excavation"
Kazakhs delivered in connection with copper production call copper "copper"
12-50 km from each other on the northwestern and eastern sides of the ridge of the city of Zhezkazgan there are copper deposits
Depending on the industrial significance and geological structure, these deposits are divided into Zhylandy (Taldybulak Multicluk Karashkoshak Kypshakbay Ayranbay Saryobay Kulmen Dongyzauyz Itauz) and the Zhartas group (Bektas Sorkudyk)
All of them are concentrated in gray arches under the Zhezkazgan retinue
Recently, this has been called the horizon of the Snake
The main metal is copper and lead in addition to them silver cobalt molybdenum t
meets
Mining and processing of metal ores will work city-forming enterprises
Main of them are enterprises within Corporation Kazakhmys LLP and RGP Zhezkazgansirekmet LLP
The largest copper industry enterprise as part of Corporation Kazakhmys LLP - Zhezkazgan smelter produces an average of 250 thousand tons of pure copper per year
The main products - cathode copper, the purity of which is estimated at 9999%, is in high demand on the international market
Holland Sweden Turkey Japan exports to China and CIS countries
In addition to the main product, lead dust gold is produced at the plant [11 257b]
RGP Zhezkazganmeter is the only enterprise in the CIS for the production of precious metals rhenium and osmium
This production of non-ferrous metals was the beginning of the transformation of Zhezkazgan into a large non-ferrous metallurgical center
spatial advantage of the location of the city of Zhezkazgan in the central part of Kazakhstan
Can be described as "strengths"
The linking of the North and South and the West by roads and the railway will be the beginning for cargo transportation between the regions and the guiding large transport and logistics centers of the city
The Zhezkazgan-Saksauil-Beineu railway route commissioned in 2015 connected the Karaganda and Mangistau regions
Construction of Zhezkazgan-Arkalyk roads will become the largest transport and logistics center for the development of transport activities
This situation will serve as the basis for the sustainable post-industrial development of the city's economy
According to this situation, from foreign experience, the small Australian city of Tennant Creek can be considered as an example
Tennant Creek is a small town located in the central part of the Northern Lands of Australia
Australian Gold Mining Center of the 1930s
Depletion of natural resources has led to the outflow of investment companies
Concerned about the crisis situation of the city, the authorities will adopt a set of measures based on the rehabilitation of the economy
According to it, the geographical location of the city effectively used natural conditions and infrastructure
Transport activities were developed through the construction of new roads and railways in the region, which was the beginning of the transformation into a territorial logistics center
The tourism sector is also developed due to the effective use of natural conditions
A small city in a depressed state in a short time turned into a tourist and logistics center
This policy was regarded as a successful step by local authorities in diversifying the city's economy [8 257 b]
The search for new fields where the mining and manufacturing industry operates in the modern conditions of the city, investments in these purposes can be considered as the main factor in the growth of the economically active population and human resources in recent years
Technological support of city-forming enterprises Development of the economy sector and new services, including knowledge-intensive production and strengthening the role of the third sector of the world economy - harmonious services, diversification of the economy - this determines the opportunities for the development of the city
In addition, the effective use of natural resources of historical and cultural monuments in the surrounding territories (Ulytau district) will allow the development of tourism
One of the weaknesses of the spatial development of Zhezkazgan is the distance from large markets from the Karaganda agglomeration zone of influence (550 km)
Transport range and poor state of roads hinder the development of cities
The current dependence of the city's economy on the activities of city-forming enterprises, a low level of diversification of the economy, wear and tear of urban infrastructure, untimely cleaning of household waste, aggravation of the environment is characterized as constraints on the development of the city
A sharp aggravation of the situation in the world market will cause new risks
For cities such as Zhezkazgan, which depend on raw materials or the activities of city-forming enterprises, this will be a very heavy blow
One of the main reasons for negative changes is a decrease in world prices caused by a decrease in demand for products of export-oriented enterprises, such as RGP Zhezkazganmeter, Corporation Kazakhmys LLP due to the financial and economic crisis
The result initiates the termination of city-forming enterprises with an increase in the number of mass unemployed
The rarity of green spaces in the city creates a new set of risks - the annual decrease in the level of the Kengir dam, which provides the industry and the population of the city with drinking water
The results of the studies conducted on the basis of the analysis of the modern state of the city can be summarized as follows in Figure 1

Photo 1 - SWOT analysis: modern state of the city
One of the main problems of single-industry towns related to the development of mineral resources is the aggravation of the environmental situation
The main objective of State policy in the State development programmes of the Republic of Kazakhstan is to stabilize the quality of the environment, create a favorable environment for human life, and protect natural resources for future generations.
Therefore, the current environmental situation is becoming a global issue that concerns humanity
One of the main factors limiting the sustainable development of Zhezkazgan single-industry towns is the poor state of the environment
The main problems of ecological disadvantage in the city are: atmospheric air pollution, untimely cleaning of household waste, accumulation of ash dumps, emissions of pollutants by numerous small solid fuel boilers with the largest volume of tailings of mining enterprises (Figure 23)
Figure 2 - in the city of Zhezkazgan		Figure 3 - Distribution of ash contaminants near terricons (Figure P
fill (Snapshot D
Aliaskarov Iskakova October 2015)	October 2015)
According to the data provided by the Department of Environmental Control of Kazhydromet RGP, the quality of atmospheric air in the city of Zhezkazgan for 4 years of the last five years remains with a high content of hazardous substances (Figure 1)
According to 2014 data, the city of Zhezkazgan was among the 7 cities of Kazakhstan with a high level of pollution (Karaganda Temirtau Lisakovsk Almaty Ust-Kamenogorsk Shymkent) (ALI5 > 7)
Atmospheric air according to the data given by the Department of Statistics of Karaganda region
quantity of polluting sources - 247 units
The volume of emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere from polluting sources in 2014 amounted to 273 thousand tons
The volume of emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere from polluting sources in 2014 amounted to 273 thousand tons [9]
We made sure that smoke was heading to the residential area when it was in the study area
Carbon monoxide of sulfurous anhydride in liquid and gaseous substances has increased content of nitrogen oxide
Emissions of harmful substances to the atmosphere in 2014 decreased by 337% compared to 2010
It is part of Corporation Kazakhmys LLP of Zhezkazgan industrial belt
Consists of 20 enterprises
Pilot production plants for the production of xanthate of the Zhezkazgan Specialized Construction and Repair Department No. 1 of the motor transport enterprise "Construction and Repair Department of the Industrial Enterprise of Railway Transport"
The enterprises creating this industrial belt are located in the eastern and western parts of the city
The number of the main pollutants released into the atmosphere from the territory of a production zone (which part hydrosulphuric lead is), includes inorganic dust nitric oxide of dioxide of sulfur of carbon coal dust of hydrosulphuric lead copper and aluminum particles of wood dust of hydrosulphuric hydrosulphuric carbon t
During the study, we found out that most of Kazakhmys Corporation's air polluting industries are located in the production zone in the east and southeast of the city (Fig. 4)
Enclosing sources of atmospheric air pollution along the railway in the east-south-west direction, the spread of environmentally hazardous substances limits the life of city residents in a favorable natural environment
Height of discarded substances as organized sources
Antennae reaching from 14 m to 46 m
In this regard, it was found that the distances from enterprises to residential buildings do not meet environmental requirements at all
Figure 4 - State of the environment and production facilities
The lack of sanitary protection between enterprises and residential buildings is the basis for the direct unhindered transfer of pollutants to the urban environment under the influence of wind
Application of wind direction from the territory of the main polluting sources in the production zones aggravates the state of the environment in the city
The environmental consequences of the industrial development of the city of Zhezkazgan, along with atmospheric air pollution, include an increase in the incidence of the population from chemical pollution of soils with drinking water and fish in reservoirs
According to the hydrochemical state of suburban surface waters, when high pollution rates are recorded in the Kengira steppe, the situation on the Kara Kengir River reached an emergency state of pollution (SLI > 100)
Major contaminants include manganese copper zinc sulphates [10]
Recent decades
The growth of "ecological" diseases (respiratory diseases, heart and vascular diseases, digestive diseases) caused social tension in an industrial single-industry city rich in resources, like Zhezkazgan
Therefore, the socio-economic environmental issue of single-industry towns is closely related to the effective implementation of urban policy
Along with a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the development of the territorial and industrial sphere of single-industry towns, the renewal of social infrastructure should contribute to improving the standard of living and quality of the local population, creating favorable conditions for involving the population in industry and public life of the city
Conclusion
The main scientific findings and practical results of the case study can be summarized as follows:
reduced demand for raw materials on the modern world market will lead to a drop in the cost of non-ferrous metals - an aggravation of the socio-economic situation in cities such as Zhezkazgan, specializing in ore mining and processing
Given that the instability in the world market, known from history, is repeated in a crisis situation, it is important for single-industry cities to restructure the model of development of economic diversification
Zhezkazgan is the country's largest center for non-ferrous metallurgy, which served as the basis for our research work
during the period of post-industrial development there is an opportunity to become a transport and logistics center
It was we who saw the spatial advantage of the city when studying transport infrastructure
At the same time, in order to solve complex socio-economic problems in the city, it is necessary to rely only on the development of transport and logistics activities, diversify the small economy by supporting small and medium-sized businesses, produce innovative types of products and form human capital in accordance with these requirements.
Zhezkazgan's economic success is mainly due to the presence of huge reserves of raw materials in the territory, their extraction and processing
Efficient use of natural resource potential is only in the direction of production of raw materials
This one-sided specialization is characterized as a deterrent to the development of other industries
Therefore, ways of efficient use of natural conditions should be considered, getting rid of dependence on raw materials
For example, natural conditions in the city have the opportunity to develop alternative energy sources
Where the average annual duration of sunlight is 2753 hours, the average annual wind speed is 4-5 m/s [12 57-70bb]
Such advantageous aspects of the natural environment will become a convenient place for hosting stations for the production of energy from the sun and wind
This situation will make it possible to effectively use the energy of the "future" along with ensuring the city's energy demand
The adverse state of the environment is characterized as a deterrent to sustainable development if the spatial advantages of the natural location and geographical location of the above-mentioned city are considered as opportunities for the development of the city
Results of a research of the current state of the city allowed to carry out SWOT analysis
Non-compliance with environmental requirements by enterprises located in the industrial zone, urban and industrial planning errors make a "contribution" to the inclusion of the territory of sanitary protection of Zhezkazgan among the most polluted cities in Kazakhstan
The results of the analysis of data provided by official organizations and the systematization of information during scientific research made it possible to draw up a map of the relationship between production and the urban environment
The results obtained in this case study will be important for the construction of a strategy for the sustainable development of the city of Zhezkazgan

shows the uneven level of economic development
Therefore, each state seeks to improve the standard of living of the regions, that is, it pursues a regional policy aimed at improving the level of regional development
The goal of the regional policy of Kazakhstan is aimed at increasing the internal and external competitiveness of the regions, ensuring the concentration of labor and capital resources in economic growth centers, creating favorable conditions and factors for increasing employment and the quality of life of the population
Institute of Economy of Kazakhstan for analysis of economic potential of regions of Kazakhstan presented model of distribution of groups of four regions, objective conditions of economy of which are distinguished by specialization of resource-production potential and nature of solved issues
The first group - areas with favorable economic prerequisites and high scientific and technological potential for production requiring high technologies
Among them - East Kazakhstan Pavlodar Karaganda Kostanay North Kazakhstan region with possibilities of technical and technological development, with high initial level for socio-economic development
The second group - areas with strategic natural mineral resources and with the possibility of developing research and production potential
The group of these regions includes the Atyrau Mangistau West Kazakhstan Kyzylorda region, where mineral extraction and processing industries with an inefficient sectoral structure of the national economy prevail
Third group is Almaty Akmola Zhambyl South Kazakhstan region, which occupies a key place in trade potential of the country
The fourth group includes regions and crisis areas, the sectoral structure of the economy of which is characterized by extreme technical and technological conditions with limited opportunities for economic specialization.
In general, regions of high research and production potential include: North and Central Kazakhstan - Middle - West and East Kazakhstan and the smallest - South Kazakhstan region [1 121 b
The development of trade and services over the past twenty years has been a driving force for developing countries when urban growth and concentration have catalysed the economies of developed countries
Therefore, the Forecast Schedule of Regional-Spatial Development includes a number of tasks
These tasks are:
"in places of growth," that is, stimulating the concentration of productive and labor resources in areas with an economic perspective and favorable for life;
Promoting the regulation and concentration of urbanization with a view to increasing production in these large cities and forming the basis for an innovative economy;
effective utilization of the resource potential and benefits of each region of the country as a whole;
the formation of competitive economic specialization of regions in the republican section of labor;
regulation of the power of production and population accommodation of engineering infrastructure (transport energy and water supply);
Sending the unemployed to promising development regions to ensure that the population has access to guaranteed public social services (especially in remote settlements);
development of border zones [6]
The forecast table consists of four parts
The first is the general development of the socio-economic development of the regions	The provision of demographic potential by labour resources is based on a comprehensive analysis of population change indicators
The second part defines the objectives and goals of spatial and regional development until 2020
The third part shows the forecast table of industry and agro-industrial complex development
The fourth part provides indicators of the development of districts during the coming decade, including ensuring the growth of the region's products as a whole, increasing the share of the manufacturing industry [2]
In terms of gross regional product (GRP), according to the data for the 1st quarter of 2014, the leader is the city of Almaty, which produces 1/5 of gross regional product in Kazakhstan (1847%)
At the same time, the main share of the gross regional product is Atyrau (131%) and

Figure 1 - Distribution of regions of Kazakhstan by shares in gross regional product (in%)
Note, Compiled by Data
Industry is the main industry that determines the development of the economy of the South Kazakhstan region
Industry accounts for 234% of the region's gross regional product, while the share of industrial products of the region in the total republican volume is 29%
In the territorial area of ​ ​ labor, the region specializes in the production of agricultural products and the processing of oil and oil products, the production of textile construction metallurgical materials and uranium products
One of the main priorities of the South Kazakhstan region economy development is to increase the competitiveness of the real sector
In this case, the achievement of sustainable development of industries involves the implementation of a set of measures aimed at the production of new technologies and the implementation of investment projects, the transition to international standards
Strengths that have a positive impact on the development of industry in South Kazakhstan region:
favourable soil and climatic conditions of the region, allowing for the effective development of agriculture;
availability of local raw materials necessary for the development of light and food industries;
availability of productive and economic potential;
availability of export-oriented production (mining production of textile metallurgy);
existence of favorable conditions for entrepreneurship development: financial and credit organizations (financial development institutions of second-level banks microcredit organizations of Maxim AIO LLP)

Despite the successes achieved, South Kazakhstan region has not sufficiently resolved the position of "point growth" in the territorial development of cities and regions with the potential of industrial growth and economic activity in their transformation into centers of economic growth
In most areas there is a high level of depreciation of fixed assets
In general, the degree of modernization of industry in the region remains insufficient its impact on the economy of the region, the share of commodities in the industrial sector in exports is growing
Such an export structure increases the economic dependence of South Kazakhstan region on external factors, especially due to the instability of the global market observed in commodity markets in recent years
On the way to achieving competitive stability of the region, the compatibility of the industry structure is important, that is, the creation of complex technological chains with raw materials of a higher period of production of one stage
Thus, the established enterprises of the vertical integration model will allow certain industries to achieve competitive success, which will affect the formation of the production structure
The industrial structure of the region is dominated by the share of manufacturing industries (Figure 2)
In the production structure of industry of South Kazakhstan region, the production and distribution of gas and water electricity constantly occupy a small share: 89% in 2014 (in 2010 - 114%)
The share of mining in the total industry increased from 135% (in 2010) to 265% in 2014
The rapid development of mining is associated with the extraction of export-oriented minerals, the main of which is uranium [4,230 b
The intensive construction of the Western Europe-Western China international transport corridor also contributed
Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Figure 2 - Industrial structure of South Kazakhstan region for 2015
Despite the positive dynamics of industrial production growth in the region, the use of production potential in sectors is uneven
One of the main reasons for this is the lack of competition with foreign producers of local products (primarily with China)
The main production infrastructure with rich natural resources of economic and human capital South Kazakhstan region, where the system of support for entrepreneurship has developed, has sufficient opportunities for balanced and sustainable development
This is evidenced by the results of industry development in 2014
Despite the crisis, the share of industrial production of South Kazakhstan region as a whole in the republic increased from 21% (2012) to 29% in 2014 (Figure 3)
The Republic ranks third in the index of physical volume in the volume of industrial production (after East Kazakhstan (1184%) and Aktobe (1070%) regions) 1065% higher than the republican indicator (1007% in the republic) [7]
Figure 3 - Index of physical volume of industrial products in the region
Strategic competitive achievements in the region include:
favorable geographical place for the development of trade and transport hubs (southern transport migration of Kazakhstan in the vicinity of Uzbekistan passes through South Kazakhstan region);
climatic conditions;
high share of small business;
presence of mineral-rich deposits (in terms of uranium reserves, the region ranks first in phosphorites and iron ores - third in Kazakhstan) [4 232 b
State of social sphere of South Kazakhstan region is characterized by high rate of natural population growth, favorable demographic conditions in priority of rural population
In turn, the quality of life of residents of the region is relatively low, since incomes in rural areas (except cotton farming) are traditionally lower than the standard of living of citizens
In the region, the resettlement of rural residents to the city continues
But urban incomes from rural areas remain low, so the average standard of living remains unchanged
In the field there are other social issues:
Lack of teachers in vocational training institutions;
Insufficient qualifications of health workers and insufficient equipment for health facilities;
the increase in the infant mortality rate in the region, especially in the city of Shymkent;
high mortality compared to other regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan;
insufficient cultural activity of the population;
low efficiency of using budget funds in the social sphere
The socio-economic situation of the population of the South Kazakhstan region is characterized by the following indicators:
According to the regional department of statistics, the number of economically active population by January 1, 2014 was 12299 thousand people, including employed - 11632 thousand people, unemployed - 665 thousand people, self-employed - 5250 thousand people, which is 472% of the employed population [3 7
The average monthly nominal wage in South Kazakhstan region in 2014 amounted to 75,332 tenge and increased by 46% compared to the corresponding period of last year (67,721 tenge), which is 45 times higher than the average cost of living (17,342 tenge)
This will provide not only 1 resident but also his dependants (figure 4) [5]

Wage Dynamics
A significant increase in nominal wages is observed in all city administrations and districts of the region
Suzak (177%) occupies a particularly high level of this indicator, and Baidibek district (02%) occupies a low level.
The cost of living per capita in the first quarter of 2014 on average compared to the first quarter of 2013 increased by 73% and amounted to 15,821 tenge (food products - 9,493 tenge non-food goods and paid services - 6328 tenge) (Figure 5)

In 2014, the average monthly nominal salary of one employee in the region (excluding small enterprises engaged in entrepreneurial activities) amounted to 73,101 tenge and increased by 40% compared to 2013, and in real terms - decreased by 12% [5]
Nevertheless, in Kazakhstan the wage level in the region remains low
So, the economic development rate of South Kazakhstan region will contribute to the well-being of the population
This is reflected in an increase in the income of the population from increasing the purchasing power of food due to increased vacancies
Therefore, it can be concluded that economic development is the key to the social development of the population of the region

Tole Kazybek Ayteke - the great Kazakh dance
The ruler at a meeting equal to the entire Kazakh land declared them rulers of his persons
The consolidation of dances by the leader of each person in that period is a matter in which not every manager resolutely goes by that time, taking decisive steps to change the dance process of the country
Because the sultans - descendants of Genghiz, who wanted to become rulers in each person, were enough
But due to the predominance of these dances, the sultans were forced to recognize their authority as forced [1 b]
Tole bi For the Great Hundred Inside the House
According to various sources, we know that Tole bi died near Tashkent
Like His Growing Dance
the path to the formation of grandfathers had a great influence
She began with a dance on Mikey dancing Bakhtiyar, described by the people as "If a Chechen became a leader"
Thule enters studies from the age of 5 on the paternal line
First, he and his father travel around the country, and then next to the prestigious dances "on the spit"
From the age of 9, he becomes a baby and is recognized in the country of power
From the age of 15 begins his own path of power
Not embarrassed by criticism of the aksakals, they receive a blessing
According to the data, Tole bi Anet receives a blessing from his grandmother
At that time, the procedure for receiving a blessing for popular prayer dances in the country is mandatory for dancing.
Famous researcher H
According to Torekulov, grandfather Anet Tole bi: he expressed his life position (loan) as follows: "A sliding wand will eat" "Unity cannot argue with a strong enemy" [2 b]
Thule bi: "I will lie away from grief
Both countries, if this happens, will unite the country. "
A person recognized as a heroic form along with the division of the Tole bi the great beetle
Tole bi once led Tashkent for more than 10 years
In one of the official publications of that time, Tole bi is listed in Tashkent as "authoritative and from the khan"
Tole bi senior of 3 great in age and along the way
An article has been preserved among the people that "Tole bi reached the entire people of Yesim Khan" [3 b
Kazybek bi - from the buckwheat of the argyn clan and in the history of Kazakhstan of the XVII and XVIII centuries.
one of the "3 lawyers" who took part in the removal of the population from the difficult situation
According to legend, Kazybek's mother suggested that when she was born, she said: "Be honest, you should be a professional."
In this part of the book, Kazybek was asked for the blessing of Tole bi and Tole bi
This meeting was as follows: Not Tole bi Kazybek said: "I said:" One child is born through a father, one child dies and one child leaves.
Which one are you? "- at least Kazybek bi:
My father said that I would have a premature baby - at least Tole bi:
I had such an impression, "she says.
Then Kazybek bi Tole asks questions about dance:
- What do you think? - At least, Tole bi:
I was close
What's your taste?
Sweet juice reddened
Lending?
Shukir, credit is growing
Kazybek will not immediately understand this feeling
Then Kazybek himself will tell Father Keldibek this meeting:
"I'm far away," he said.
I said, "How good is it?" I wanted to know you were asleep.
He said, "Sweet slipped."
I asked: "Loan?" - how will their children wait.
He said: "Shukir, credit thrives" and said that their children are waiting well
Good people who kept the middle hundred on their knees without Kazybek did not solve a single important matter
His opinion at one time was considered the famous Abilmambet Abylai Khan [4 b
History is known for the fact that the authority of Alshyn Ayteke-bi exceeded a small hundred territories
There is no exact information about the years of his birth, but there is an assumption that he lived 56 years
According to Yeslamgaliyev's research, he was buried near Mount Nurata near Samarkand
His name is Tole Kazybek.
Turning to the data, he showed that Tole bi and Kazybek were younger than dance
In historical literature, Ayteke bi recalls that he spent most of his life in the Kazakh steppe between the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers [5 b
Ayteke bi at one time received higher education, studied at the famous madrasah Ulykbek and graduated well, studying several oriental languages ​ ​ - Arabic Turkish
From the age of five passed the school of famous dances
Tole Kazybek and Ayteke bi at a congress held in the suburbs of Turkestan are determined to be fair to preserve the unity of the people [6 b
Therefore, when Kazakh peoples stand on earth, shock is visible in its blue sky.

One of the most important types of agricultural and material production
Agriculture provides the population with food and some raw materials
Given that agriculture consists of two large industries - crop production and animal husbandry, in the agriculture of the Saryagash district of South Kazakhstan region these industries have a special place.
Saryagash - the largest production and agrarian region of South Kazakhstan region
Currently, the basis of market infrastructure is laid here
In addition, the area is rich in medicinal mineral waters
Cereal vegetable melons have favorable climatic conditions for growing tobacco and grapes, as well as the possibility of using pastures as a feed base during the year can have a significant impact on the development of livestock
Agricultural producers believe that with the full and effective use of agricultural land, the region can provide the need for residents of the republic in several types of vegetables
The purpose of this work is to increase the natural and economic potential of the Saryagash region with the development of market relations in the current economic crisis
In particular, consider the issues of maximizing the provision of domestic food products to the population with an increase in the rate of agricultural production
Form of research - Saryagash district of South Kazakhstan region
In 2015, products worth 19 billion 835 million tenge were produced in this area.
The index of volume of manufactured products this year amounted to 1050%
810 new jobs created and launched in agriculture alone
In the conditions of relative stability of livestock production in the region, fluctuations in crop production were observed
In the resort area, named after Shipaly, today the number of youth engaged in agriculture has increased
Saryagash district is an administrative-territorial part located in the southern part of the South Kazakhstan region
Saryagash, since 1928 formed by the Keles district in 1939
The area occupied is 76 thousand km2
Population 309,083 people (2015)
The lands of the region mainly occupy a hilly plain
Beltau North Ridge (592 m) west of Izakuduk
south of the Kauynbaimold ridge is occupied by the Shardarin reservoir
Mineral water with marble sand of bentonite clays explored in the bowels
Climate continental winter (around to 10 C) with hot summer (to + 40 C)
Average annual air temperature in January -2
-3 ° С in July + 24 + 28 ° С
Plant growth time 220-320 days
The average annual rainfall reaches 80-300 mm
The Keles Kurkeles Ashchisay rivers flow through the west of the district from the southeast of Syr Darya
Gray and sandy soils [1 144 b
Within the framework of the Unified Business Support and Development Program "Business Roadmap 2020" there is a high contribution to the improvement of agriculture
So, according to actual data on agriculture, in 2015, 75,990 hectares were actually sown under the program (Table 1)
Volume of agriculture in Saryagash district
Within the framework of this program, 141 units of greenhouses for 501 hectares of sown areas were built
Considering that the main part of greenhouses in Kazakhstan is located in the territory of this region, it can be noted that throughout the season issues of providing the population with vegetables are actively developing in the country
Introduction of drip watering method
In 2015, the district plans to introduce a drip irrigation method of 760 hectares of arable land, in fact 7378 hectares were completed
Its basis is fruit and berry vegetable crops
Our compatriots who moved from Uzbekistan develop greenhouse economy especially well
Diversification of crops is one of the main tasks of agricultural development
Therefore, the area pays attention to the cultivation of various fruits and melons
One of them can be called a vineyard
In recent years, the state has paid great attention to the development of this economy
Grapes are grown up in many districts of the Southern Kazakhstan area [3,200 b]
However, these fruiting Saryagash savages sow as much as possible
At one time, the glory to the villages of Kaplanbek Zhibek zholy Juzimdik Ushkyn Kurkeles spread to the whole republic through this economy
In the Saryagash region there were years of production of 60 thousand tons of grapes
When the Soviet Union broke up, "transparent baths" on an area of ​ ​ thousands of hectares disappeared from view
Seedlings that allocated land sown fruits and other crops
Over 15 years, the total area decreased by 10 times compared to the previous
The vineyards were restored only in 2007, when the state began to support these fertile crops
Now farmers prefer to grow table grapes in contrast to technical varieties
Because there is only one enterprise for the reception of technical varieties
He himself evaluates products too cheaply
The more expensive table varieties
But this is no more than 8-10 tons per hectare, according to experienced savages, allows reviving viticulture
However, the low-cost valuation of products grown on frontal furs is worse for gardeners than in this farm
entails
Experts believe that in the area it is necessary to increase the number of winemakers
Then competition will rise in price
If the products are appreciated, savages will continue to develop viticulture
The beginning of the Government's allocation of significant funds for the development of viticulture in the South, the glory of which is known throughout the republic, determines viticulture in other areas of the South Kazakhstan region, except Saryagash
But the above problems are common to them
If the prices of grapes of technical varieties rose in price, this industry would be further developed
Visit of vineyard in Saryagash district during the working trip of Head of State Nursultan Nazarbayev to South Kazakhstan region in September 2013
Got acquainted with the work of Caspian Food LLP
Winemakers who received the support of the Head of State at this meeting, with the help of subsidies received from the government, today produce high-quality products in accordance with market requirements
High-quality grape varieties "Rkattsili" "Saperavi" and French "Kaberne Fran" "Cabernet Sauvignon" "Sauvignon Blanche" and others are planted on land belonging to the plant
Today, industrious southerners are working tirelessly to prove the words of the Head of State that the South, which has sown on crops, is now turning into a high-quality horticultural industry.
Among them are our brothers who moved from Uzbekistan
Now in the Saryagash district there are 2205 hectares of vine land, of which about 1400 hectares.
And the rest of the youth continues to grow
In the fall of 2015, 73 centners of grapes were harvested from each hectare of vineyards
Also currently there are 4 wineries
The first steps of the region to develop a wine cluster are pleasing
Subsidies in the amount of 6166 million tenge for fuel and lubricants are also allocated depending on the structure of crops
Agricultural zoning
Depending on the conditions of placement in natural conditions and specialization in one type of agriculture, the territory of the district can be divided into 2 natural zones and 2 zone zones:
Desert-steppe zone - sheep breeding is well developed in this zone
Belongs to this zone:
a) Darbazinsky rural district
c) Zhanaturmysk rural district
Desert-steppe zone - irrigated and non-irrigated lands are developed in these places
Dairy and sheep breeding are developed in this zone of animal husbandry
According to animal husbandry, in 2015 the district produced 251538 tons of meat 854045 tons of milk in live weight 14 million 5598 thousand pieces of eggs 9373 tons of wool
Meat production compared to the Program was performed by 32,462 tons, or by 886%, milk production - 5,955 tons, or 993%, egg production - by 5 million 8,402 thousand pieces, or by 714%, wool production - by 339 tons, or by 965%
Depreciation of tenge rate in the country contributes to decrease of income from agricultural products
As you know, breeding in the region is the most important factor in animal husbandry
In this regard, the public does not exclude that in 2015, 153 heads of breeding bulls were acquired on the herd
In order to increase the number of livestock, work is underway on the Altyn asyk Sybaga Kulan program
As of January 1, 2016 in the region there are 921 thousand heads of cattle, including 334 thousand heads of sheep-goats 2033 thousand heads 9683 heads of horses 1435 heads of camels 1080 thousand heads
Compared to last year, 2,312 heads of goat sheep increased 29,989 heads of horses 463 heads of camels of 3 other birds 398 heads
In all regions of Kazakhstan, residents of the country are engaged in animal husbandry, but 3/5 of the livestock are raised in the north and south of the country
Depending on the ratio of meat to milk, which is the main product, routes are disconnected in it
Dairy and dairy animal husbandry is developed in the south [2]
Issues of food security of the population of the republic today are among the current
The level of development of the agricultural sector is the main factor determining the economic and socio-political stability of the country
More than 40 per cent of the country's population derives from rural areas, for many of which land is the main means of production [3]
Nevertheless, in the agriculture of the region there are many interesting questions
It is worth noting that there are many unresolved problems in the agro-industrial complex manufacturing agricultural products;
low level of agricultural processing infrastructure;
insufficient irrigated water;
insufficient agricultural processing and vegetable storage facilities;
the small number of land holdings with the collapse of peasant farms does not allow the use of new varieties while respecting the procedure for the use of new technologies;
disposal of irrigation infrastructure (precipitation and clogging) in the territories of peasant farms;
population outflows from rural areas;
wear of tractor fleet machines above 80%;
low level of infrastructure and communications;
non-compliance with land crop rotation;
inefficient use of irrigated water;
- the lowest purchase price in cotton farming - the outflow of cotton farmers to cities with a decrease in the profitability of this type of economy;
- Insufficient budgetary resources for the support and development of agro-industrial complex;
concrete work is needed to improve the tribal veterinary service
Along with problems, one of the projects can be called the construction of Status KBO Building LLP - a plant for the production of fruit and berry crops from the territory of the city of Saryagash and a gardening plan for 100 hectares from the Oshakta rural district
If this project is implemented in 2017, then in the future the region will be able to avoid a crisis
General agriculture differs from industry in three basics
In agriculture, land is considered the main subject and means of work
Agriculture - seasonal sector of the economy
The impact of natural conditions on agricultural production will be direct
In the Address to the people of Kazakhstan on November 30, 2015, the system of state spending and subsidies should be revised
Today, entire industries live at the expense of the state
At the same time, for example, through KazAgro Corporation, it was said that state support tools are not available for half of all agricultural producers [4]
The agriculture issues raised in the Address are now being addressed by relevant specialists in the region
In general, Saryagash district occupies a special place in the country's agriculture
In the case of rational resolution of the issues raised, the district will have the opportunity to provide residents of the republic with several types of agricultural products

The use of natural and synthetic ionizing materials is becoming one of the most important issues in solving current production and environmental situations in the country.
Currently, ionites with multifunctional carboxyl groups are relevant, meeting the basic requirements for them, recovered in a simple and acceptable way, not requiring expensive poisonous reagents [1]
In galvanic workshops, acid and alkali in the composition of residual water, copper cyanide chromium
poisonous substances are found
When the maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) (01 mg/l) are exceeded, their compounds have direct or indirect harmful toxic and carcinogenic effects on animals and fish.
For example, when poisoned with chromium supplements, they accumulate in the renal endocrine glands, causing oncological and various skin diseases
Therefore, water treatment is now a very important issue
Application of ion-exchange substances and t, to which several methods of purification of water-soluble impurities of sorption extraction of electrocoagulation neutralization of ozonation evaporation are known
methods [2]
Ion-exchange substances - ionites are often used in production in life
Aqueous solutions used in the production were poured into the steppes to a large amount and were in vain
They contain rare harmful compounds and various ions, albeit in small amounts
Now they will be cleared of ionites
The effectiveness of this method with respect to other methods allows increasing the concentration of released ions
Purified water can be reused in production
For example, in the production of chromium paint, nickel is copper zinc, and in the production of artificial fiber, copper ions and radioactive ions are released [3]

Hydrolysis irreversible hydrolysis accompanied by ionic equilibrium hydrolysis constant
Theoretical introduction
When examining aqueous solutions of salts, it was found that they have an acidic or alkaline medium, that is, they change the color of the acid-based indicator
For example, the bottom table shows the results of some laboratory experiments
Any salt can be considered as a result of the neutralization reaction between the acid and the base and their solutions.
But, as we see in practice, only in a solution of sodium chloride the color has not changed, and otherwise - one of them changes color
Change the color of the indicator chemical reaction characteristic
There are other data
For example, when aluminum sulfide is dissolved in water, a white precipitate forms and gas is released with the unpleasant odor of a rotten egg
How to explain this fact? What processes can occur when the salt dissolves in water?
Electrolytic dissociation theory may explain this fact
When dissolved, salts can react with water molecules formed by less dissociable products released into N + or O-ions that change the color of the indicator as a result of the formation of cations and anions
Hydrolysis is the interaction of soluble salt ions with water molecules, leading to the formation of weak dissociable products (weak acidic or basic molecules, anions of acidic salts or cations of sound salts) and accompanied by a change in the pH of the medium
Depending on the acidic and reasonable forces of the salts, it is possible to classify:
Salts formed from a strong acid and a weak base;
Salts from weak acidic and strong bases;
Salts formed from weak acid and weak bases;
Salts formed from a strong acidic and strong base;
The latter is not hydrolyzed because strong electrolytes can be formed again as a result.
All other types of salts can undergo more or less hydrolysis depending on the strength of the electrolyte that formed them
The weaker the acid or base, the deeper the hydrolysis [2]
For other salts, three types of hydrolysis are allowed depending on the presence of the anion cation and other salt ions in them.
Salts (NH4 CI CuSO4 and t, from strong acid and weak base
) characterizes hydrolysis by cation
In this case, the equilibrium of the system with the bonding of salt cations with water ions to the right H O	H++ OH- shifts
PRZ of hydrolysis products of displacement degree
determined by
The lower this value, the more ions of OH bind, the N + ion equilibrium concentration in the salt solution increases accordingly, and hydrolysis is increased
To indicate the presence of N + and O-ions of water in hydrolysis, its formula in the equations of such a reaction is often indicated as NON, for example:
[H +] > [OH-] - acidic medium pH < 7
Salts from weak acid and strong bases (CH3 COONA KCN and t
) characterizes hydrolysis by anion
In this case, the salt anions bind to N + water ions and the O:
or
[OH-] > [H +] - alkaline medium pH > 7
Hydrolysis by cation and anion for salts from weak acid and weak bases	characteristic
An example is the hydrolysis of ammonium hydroxide:
and
Both processes reinforce each other due to bonding with N + and O ions
The reaction of solutions of such salts is determined by the ratio of hydrolysis products to the values ​ ​ of the dissociation constant
Ammonium cyanide solution is a weak alkaline reaction
(NEMOH) > (HCN) (18-10-5 and 79-10-9, respectively)
The neutrality of salts of this type, for example solutions, is based on the equality of the CD values formed during the hydrolysis of acid and base
If the hydrolysis of salts produces heavy soluble or gaseous substances, then when they are accumulated in the necessary amounts, a precipitate is supplied in the solution that completely displaces the equilibrium and makes hydrolysis irreversible, or a gas is formed
Examples include Al3 + and Cr3 + sulfides of three-charge cations:
Constant and degree of hydrolysis
Characterizes hydrolysis by hydrolysis constant and degree of hydrolysis [2]
The degree of hydrolysis h means the ratio of the number of hydrolyzed salt molecules to the total number of dissolved salt molecules:
total number of dissolved salt molecules
The degree of hydrolysis is determined by the following factors: the concentration and temperature of the saline solution of the dissociation constant
By the hydrolysis constant Kg is meant the ratio of the number of concentrations of hydrolysis products to the concentrations of non-hydrolyzed salts
Equilibrium constant for the reaction CN- + HOH - HCN + OH-
[H2 0] is replaced by the other side of the equality due to the constant value, which shows the hydrolysis constant of the new constant value:
The difference in the value of kg from the degree of hydrolysis does not depend on the concentration of the solution, so it is effective to describe the process
For example, 01M is the degree of hydrolysis of sodium acetate in solution? Calculate the pH of this solution
But
We assume that the concentration of acetic acid formed is equal to the concentration of OH ions and is equal to the concentration of acetate ion equal to the amount of salt, each of these values is hydrolyzed, that is, 01 mol/l
In this case K = [0H-] 2/C
The corresponding amount of salt was hydrolyzed
Degree of hydrolysis h: 7 4 10 - 6
Total primary concentration of weak acid anion	Denote C mol/l:
with low h: = ch2 h = ± K/s
In an aqueous salt solution, three interconnected reversible processes occur: dissociation of water from salt hydrolysis and dissociation of hydrolysis products
The corresponding equilibria are characterized by the constants KW Kg and KD, which can be found using any hydrolysis reaction, for example:
The concentration of N + ions in the solution in the established equilibrium is the same for each equilibrium system
from here
that is, the salt hydrolysis constant is equal to the ratio of the dissociation constant of the water ion product hydrolysis product [1]
If the salt consists of a weak acid and a weak base
where Kd - and KD - constant of dissociation of products by cation and anion
The amount of hydrolysis of multi-charge cations or formed salts of anions goes through a step determined by the quantitative value of the hydrolyzable ion charge
For example, copper (II) chloride and sodium carbonate are hydrolyzed in two steps:
As can be seen from the equation, hydroxocathione or hydroanions are formed in the 1st stage of hydrolysis
The value of their PRZ is lower than the Ke values ​ ​ of the corresponding acids and bases that are products of the 2nd stage of hydrolysis
We can say that the value of K G 2 will always be higher than the value of KG
This feature of hydrolysis
N + and O-H ions formed from the first intensive stage reduce the degree of hydrolysis in the next stage
Of practical importance is the process taking place only in 1 stage, as a result of which the hydrolysis of salts is limited in the evaluation
For example NaHCO3 in a solution of acidic salts, the HSO-anion solution is vigorous due to the absence of OO ions in the first stage of the medium salt solution (Na CO)
The reaction of hydrotuseritins can be acidic or alkaline depending on the ratio of the two values ​ ​ of the hydroion - Kg and Ke
When determining the NaHCO of solution K (NSO -), [OH-] ions are a weak alkaline reaction, since when K (NSO -) is detected, more [H +] ions
If one by cation (in an amount of more than N +) mix solutions of two hydrolyzable salts by anion (in an amount of more than O -), then due to the formation of less dissociable water ions, their hydrolysis is increased
As a result, for example, of many dual-core cations (Mg2 + Cu2 + Zn2 + Mn2 + Co2 + Ni2 + and t
) precipitates may be formed in salt solutions or gaseous substances, including soda, may be released
In this case, hydroxocarbonates that are not carbonates precipitate, increasing the degree of hydrolysis of Me2 + with an increase in the concentration of ions MeON + makes it sufficient to form CO3 Me (OH) 2 of a slightly soluble basic salt
Increased hydrolysis of the H2CO3 anion of the solution and, accordingly, leads to the formation of such massive CO2, increasing its solubility in water
The whole process is given in ion-molecular form:
Considering the hydrated state of the salt ions in the aqueous solution, hydrolysis by cation can be considered as the acid dissociation of the aquacoplex:
or 2 steps each
Thus, as a result of hydrolysis by cation, aquahydrocomplexes are formed
Since cations of strong bases (alkali and alkali metals) have a large radius and eight electronic configurations of the outer electron layer	weakly polarize coordinated water molecules
Therefore, in this case, aquacomplexes do not have acid dissociation and do not have hydrolysis of salts by cation
Hydration of anions occurs due to hydrogen bonding
The formation of a bond of anions of hydrogen atoms weakens the bond of its oxygen atoms, which leads to the possibility of the release of OH ions from water molecules
The lower the hydrogen bond, the simpler the process
Anions of weak acids have a high degree of hydrolysis with a strong hydrogen bond CO32- CH3CO- CN- CIO-

Lecture seminar-laboratory lesson "Chemistry" Laboratory complex "Educational" Computer methodological manual "
The subject of physical chemistry 5B011200 "in a pedagogical university is one of the main disciplines in the training of students in a chemical specialty, which is significant for the higher interpretation of the theoretical basis of chemistry in the secondary school curriculum of future teachers
Physical Chemistry "intermediate science between chemistry and physics
He explores the patterns of chemical reactions, as well as physical phenomena
Recently, physical chemistry biology biophysics geochemistry
such intermediate sciences are rapidly developing and gaining a lot of interesting scientific and practical data
Patterns and methods of physical chemistry are applied in almost all fields of science
Both theoretical and practical methods are used in physical chemistry
In the analysis of experience data and the generalization of these chemical reactions, three types of theoretical physics can be noted: thermodynamic statistical and quantum-mechanical
The thermodynamic approach is based on thermodynamic laws that formulate relationships and transformations of different energies
This approach is used when calculating energy in the conversion of substances in the calculation of chemical equilibrium
The statistical approach is that the molecular nature of substances linking the macroscopic properties of substances with the microscopic properties of molecules is based on teaching
For this purpose, in most cases, probability theory is used
The quantum-mechanical approach is based on the conclusion that the energy transition occurs only in a certain amount
When studying the thermal imaging of this method when creating a quantitative theory of atomic structure in the understanding of spectral photovoltaic phenomena and t
very effective
Teaching physical chemistry at a university: in lecture classes, "revealing the physical meaning of the main laws of chemical thermodynamics and its application in the release of various theoretical and practical reports; in practical (seminar) sessions, "the application of theoretical knowledge in the preparation of specific chemical reports; conditions for displacement of thermodynamic processes in the direction necessary for determining the physical value of the values ​ ​ of the thermodynamic function and calculating the flow rate of chemical reactions for determining kinetic parameters of various processes; Conduct "physical" chemical experience in a laboratory workshop and learn how to process experimental values based on experience errors
Kinetics is the theoretical basis of many applied areas of chemistry and many chemical disciplines
The section "Chemical kinetics" describes the issues of formal kinetics of simple reactions and the basic principles of the theory of chemical kinetics
In the section of electrochemistry, such issues as corrosion of metals of the electrolysis process of galvanic cell solutions are considered
Specific chemical reaction models
as soon as possible as a task for students to work independently
When studying this course, the student: the terms of the main concepts of chemical thermodynamics apply the laws of chemical thermodynamics in their physical meaning and when issuing theoretical and practical reports; essence of chemical processes: possibility of process progress and condition of its direction; chemical and phase equilibrium of the properties of solutions "the application of the laws of thermodynamics in teaching equality; the main provisions of the theory of chemical kinetics and questions of formal kinetics of simple reactions; Basic issues of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis make it possible to learn such concepts as the laws of the mutual transition of electric and chemical energy
In the teaching methodology of the subject of physical chemistry, the university uses forms of organizing the process of classroom and out-of-competition training [1
Organizational forms of education of students are the means of development of their professional "creative activity" as future specialists
The figure shows the forms of organization of the educational process
Figure 1 "Diagram of training process organization form
Physical chemistry courses use three forms of training: lectures, practical classes and seminars
When passing physical chemistry, independent work takes an important place, that is, it shows the compliance of modular training technology
The goal of students "independent work is to prepare abstracts for the conference of elective lessons for the information search of students for the ability to independently work with literature
Student prepares independent work with creative and cognitive character
SRH is interlinked with audit and freelance forms
Most students record lectures automatically, not paying attention to the meaning, but our task is to make lecture time "useful," so many lectures are problematic in nature, which makes students pay attention and think about them
In order to expedite the reception of the lecture course and its main issues, as well as organize the systematic independent work of students, a calendar of lectures and practical classes is posted on the bulletin board and a training manual "Training" is drawn up according to the plan.
Tasks that include self-contained work tasks and self-monitoring issues performed by students during each lesson
To better perceive theoretical material and activate the attention of students, multimedia tools are used
Multimedia tools allow you to prove laws and concepts in practice using demonstrations without conducting chemical practices
Forms lecture skills among students, where he monitors the role of theoretical material and learns to plan the main conclusions
Implementation of practical works (workshop for the accounting of seminars, laboratory works) is of great importance in the training of students of physical and colloidal chemistry
In connection with the development of science and technology, students currently have a need to master modern scientific and laboratory equipment with the development of experienced skills that teach students to observe safety techniques, draw conclusions from them, monitor organizational and design experimental and laboratory results
The chemical experience itself is a strong driver of interest in the teaching discipline [2
The association of chemical theory with practice makes complex theory important and attractive to the student compared to the practical part of the workshop of using theoretical knowledge in the production of chemical reports [3
The trend in the development of education from chemistry: a reduction in classrooms (intensification of education); application of modern educational technologies (mainly computerization of the educational process); updating of laboratory training methods; Updating the Laboratory Database with Automatic Measurement
Currently, the presence of laboratory facilities in the chemical laboratory equipped with obsolete standard facilities, as well as the overhaul and repair of special equipment, pose significant difficulties for conducting laboratory exercises in physical chemistry due to the high cost
In order to solve these issues in the laboratory of physical chemistry of the Department of Chemistry
Acquired the training and laboratory complex "Chemistry" and "General Chemistry"
This is a complex: Thermochemistry Phase equilibrium Chemical equilibrium Thermodynamics solutions Electrochemistry Conductometry Electrolysis Potentiometry allows you to conduct laboratory classes in the main sections of chemistry, such as chemical kinetics [3 b]
The purpose of this complex: technical and methodological updating of laboratory exercises in the main sections of chemistry; intensification of the training process, improvement of the level of assimilation of theoretical materials and expansion of applied skills of physical and chemical research; computerization of laboratory work in the main sections of chemistry
Features of the Chemical training and laboratory complex: large-scale use (universal); multifunctional; implementation of the module; low visibility of laboratory plant parameters, as a whole, autonomous operation and computer control capability; ease of preparation and transportation for operation; methodological and software
The Chemistry training and laboratory complex includes: universal controllers; thermostat thermal analysis of electrochemistry; sensor; software includes manuals
With the help of such a training and laboratory complex, you can do all laboratory work under the program on physical chemistry and in one module in the methodological manual you can present several laboratory works of various levels of complexity
There is not enough time to prepare laboratory work, students will first familiarize themselves with the laboratory work created by special methodological means, analyze it in lessons, and then begin to perform work on dividing from 2-3 students into groups
From the methodological tool of each laboratory work
preambles to special techniques are presented for controlling another computer module
In this preamble, the algorithm of operation is fully presented
The results of students' experience when creating laboratory work are stored in the "results bank" of the computer, which allows the teacher to check at any time
And calculations and graphs in most cases calculate the computer itself using a printer.
This will save time
In conclusion, this will allow with the help of this educational and laboratory complex to conduct laboratory classes in physical chemistry to save time on awakening students' interest in the subject and update the methodology for conducting laboratory classes for a good student's assimilation of theoretical material
Strengthening the skills of the educational process Spectral methods of analysis of research information technologies Formation of scientific and theoretical knowledge of the problem of organic compounds
Phytocenose pesticides disinfecting ecologically of the same type transect
The use of pesticides to protect against adverse environmental factors is considered one of the mandatory stages of agricultural technology
Nevertheless, it is known that pesticides as ecotoxicants negatively affect the genetic structure and processes of plant life [12]
Land destroyed by obsolete pesticides in all regions of Kazakhstan threatens not only the environment, but also human health
Therefore, as a result of physiological biochemical and genetic examination of pesticide effects on plants, species capable of withstanding pollution have been identified [3]
In Almaty region, poisonous plants were identified in pesticide storage sites in order to study phytocenous plant species
During the study
Choosing 100 square meters by random selection method for three fractions of 10 square meters, here plants were systematized for species and seeds, samples of soil and agricultural products were taken [4]
When removed from contaminated foci with the establishment of ecological rows and transects in the volume of contaminated land, systematic distribution of phytocenosis was added
The following types are considered:
dominants give preference to species that are not found in large numbers;
auxiliary in small quantities;
third - rare species
Research results
75 plant species of 26 breeds were registered in a pollution center with an area of ​ ​ one hundred square meters
When examining the content of plants in phytocenosis, the disparity of different plants is different, and in individual fractions it occurs in the form of separate groups
In the spring (April), mainly from ephemera (Ceratocephalus ortoceras Lappula spinocarpos Capsella bursa pastoris Tplaspi arvense Allyssum Turkestanicum) from wheat seeds (Bromus tectorum Poa bulbosa), from new young plants Barkestanicum
In May, in these places there is a variety of plants due to the transition to the generating phase
The total background of the pollution centers are wild wheat species - Bromus testorum i
Of vegetative plant species, Artemisia annua Cannabis ruderalis and Polygonum aviculare and single flowering plants Artemisia annua Cannabis ruderalis and Polygonum increased
In June, the vegetation cover stopped the development of some plants (Ceratophalusortchoceras Capcella bursa-pastoris), their place was taken by later species (Kocia scoparia Erigeron canadensis Ambrosiaartemisifolia)
In July, there was a noticeable localization of vegetation cover of contaminated land below the spring period
The composition of plants contaminated land in August amounted to 20 species of plants
So, in the spring-spring period, the natural population of wild plants corrected and the difference in time of phenological phases depended on high-speed seasonal aspects
The dynamics of this seasonal transition are shown in Table 1
Dynamics of seasonal transition of plant visits with predominance in 1 point of contaminated focus
Numerous observations have shown that the effects of poisonous pesticides in the soil during plant development affect not only species change, but also the compatibility of plants growing in phytocenosis:
Studies have revealed the predominance of weeds and herbal associations that dominated the field and vegetation within a 100 m radius and the gradual depletion of species composition and structure in phytocenosis
Vegetation compatibility changes as it moves away from the source of contamination
The main forms are represented by rhizome forms (wheat grass chips - wild meadows) and apomycated (legume meadow herbaceous garlic white gauze)
The latter with special efforts of the reproductive mechanism (diplosporia aposporia and adventative seed) form the type of offspring of the maternal form
Apomycts have high viability and competitiveness and are characterized by no signs of extinction
Their persistent overdose does not affect adverse environmental factors
It is these plants that are precursors that inhabit areas contaminated with all types of chemicals

Summary: structure of organization of blood vessel cadmium chloride endotheliocytes ribosome mitochondria tagansorbent
Pollution of the environment with chemical additives poses a great danger to the health of human settlements
Including the ingress of heavy metals into the biosphere under the influence of anthropogenic factors occupies an important place in this process and occupies a leading position in terms of hazards
Copper lead cadmium mercury to heavy metals iron and t
enters
According to certain data [1] (Vronsky 1996), the volume of heavy metals exported to the environment during processing of the corresponding raw materials due to anthropogenic substances is indicated in table 1
highest number of heavy metals in the lead and cadmium schedule
Then nickel is sprayed with mercury and copper
Readings of certain metals in various volumes, for example, copper 56-87
% means its release into the environment in different volumes in each zone of the earth's surface
However, if you warn of how harmful heavy metals are to health, you can see that the indicators in this table pose a great threat to the environment.
Describe what anthropogenic factors affect the spread of cadmium into the environment and how it affects health
Cadmium is the largest of heavy metals
Causes of cadmium spreading into the environment Coal dust chemical fertilizers plastics waste and tobacco smoke combustion products
Unlike lead, cadmium easily passes from soil to plant (up to 70%) and is painted out of the body
Affects the renal (renal) nervous system of the genitals, causes pain "Itai-Itai" damage to the respiratory system [23]
Persistent deterioration of exoecological conditions in the process of vital activity is due to pollution of the endoecological microenvironment of the body, as a result of which structural-functional insufficiency is observed in any lymphatic zones or in the body as a whole
This provision requires the search for new methods of management of the lymphatic system performing drainage and detoxification activities [45]
Purpose of work: application of taganesorbent for restoration of organizational structure of lymph nodes of cervix of animals after poisoning with cadmium chloride
Materials and methods: lymph nodes of white rats neck belonging to Wistar region were obtained as a study material
When creating an experimental model, cadmium chloride was regularly used to poison rats
To correct the organizational structure of the lymph node, a tagansorbent was used with the addition of 8-9 mg of cadmium chloride in a normal vivar diet, calculating the weight of animals in each kilogram for 25 months in a round-the-clock morning (15 hours)
Tagansorbent - unique mineral adsorption substance
Its uniqueness - the presence of sodium montmorillonite consists mainly of bentonite rocks and ranks first among clay minerals, in the exchange complex of which in addition to calcium magnesium potassium contains sodium
Animals were divided into 3 groups: the second - exotoxicosis; Third - enterosorption (1 g per normal diet, calculating the weight of animals in each kilogram for 30 days per day)
Tagansorbent on)
Studies of animals of all groups were carried out on 25 days after the addition of Tagansorbent to the daily diets of 30 animals of the third group with regular chloride poisoning 1 7 14 21
After decapitation of animals in Telesnitsky solution, the material was fixed
During the day, the material was placed in a solution consisting of 70% ethyl alcohol after being on a fixer.
Samples prepared using common methods

Results: 1 day after cadmium chloride poisoning, dystrophic changes were observed in the cytoplasms of blood microtamine endotheliocytes in the lymph nodes of the neck of all animals studied and cell tumors
It is shown that the Interstitut space has grown into a magical and delicate
Study of animals included by Tagansorbent in diet after cadmium chloride poisoning at this time
shows that the observed changes in their structure coincide with the above data
During the morphological study, it was found that the granular endoplasmic cells of blood capillaries in endotheliocytes and tanks of the Golgi complex were maganally expanded
The volume density of granulated endoplasmic cell in animals of the second group was increased by 52%, and in the third group of tagansorbent - by 48%
The quantitative density of registered ribosomes and unregistered polysome ribosomes decreased by 45% 46% according to the second practical group, and in the group that received the third experimental Tagansorbent decreased by 43% to 44%
Mitochondrial bulk densities increased by 52% to 48%
It should be noted that the crystals of these organoids are almost close to destruction.
Reduced bulk density of microsynocytous vesicles reflecting intensity of transport processes in cells
Reduced bulk density of basal micropinocytous vesicles according to 57% 60% luminal - 54% 49% cytoplasmic - 56% 52%
Also, the number of microbes on the apical slopes of endotheliocytes in animals of both experimental groups decreased by 80% 78%
After 7 days, an animal study found that dystrophic changes in tumors and cytoplasms of lymph node vascular cells were preserved
Magical enlargement and development of interstitut space are still preserved
A study of animals to which the tagansorbent is connected showed that changes in cell structure coincide with the data above
After 14 days, studies showed that dystrophic changes in tumors and cytoplasms of cells persist in endotheliocytes in blood microtamers
The growth and development of interstitial space is still preserved in the second practical group, which Tagansorbent did not receive
In the group of animals taken by Tagansorbent, changes in dystrophy and a decrease in interstitial space were revealed
After 21 days, the study showed the preservation of tumor phenomena in endotheliocyte cells in blood chips
Processes showing growth and production of interstitial space showed that animals of the second experimental group that did not receive Tagansorbent are still preserved in lymph nodes
The elimination of dystrophic changes in the group of animals taken by Tagansorbent was revealed, that the interstitial space became normal and the tumor process returned
Therefore, within 21 days, the complete restoration of the organizational structure of the endotheliocytes of animals included in the Tagansorbent diet began
This phenomenon exhibits tread properties to the organizational structure of vascular cells of the Tagansorbent
Keywords: lymphatic hemocirculation diabetes cardiology toxicology physiology
Lymph vessels and nodes contain smooth muscles as well as developed nerves
The sources of nervousness of the thoracic lymph section are the heads of the rod thoracic nodes, from which the head and abdominal nerves suffer, nerve breaks between the walls
Lymph nodes retain tumor cells and take an active part in protein oil exchange
Nodes take an active part in the transformation of blood proteins, including serum
Lymphatic vessels create a sewage (drainage) system on the body and remove excess amount of intermediate fluid in organs
Due to the high conductivity of lymphatic capillaries, various foreign substances pass into the lymphatic system
They are filtered in lymph nodes acting as a biological filter and disinfected with the participation of mesh endothelium cells
Lymph cells form in lymph nodes
Infectious disease pathogens also spread with the lymphatic system [1]
Lymph nodes are formed from the accumulation of cells at the point of connection of lymph vessels
They are located around blood vessels
Lymph node shape - sperm (remember the immune system)
One side of the lymph nodes has a built-in opening inside
At the site of this cut are arterial bleeding and nerves
Outer surface of lymph nodes is lined with dense package of welded tissue
Location of lymph nodes: abdominal cavity of the neck of the sleeve, ulnar and bile under the knee and t
Sometimes lymph nodes are exposed to collected bacteria
For example, in case of printing disease, knots are produced on the neck (without shock)
Lymph nodes regulate the lymph flow involved in the body's protective reaction during blood formation
In practice, rats were found to have protein adsorption in lymph cell shells separated from lymph nodes
This paper presents data for the treatment of a sample of alloxan diabetes in rats and results of the lymphatic flow test at its development (alloxan diabetes) [4]
Form of experience: weight 220-250 g
60 laboratory white rats
2 groups of rats were experimented:	controlled (10 rats) 2nd test (40 rats)
Alloxane under skin of the second group (15 mg/100g)
All rats sleeping with ether anesthesia showed glucose content from intestinal lymphatic vessels [5]
Also, after mathematical calculations, we test probability theory using the well-known Student and Fisher criteria when comparing groups with data M ± m [6]
Statistically processed the obtained data using a computer program Microsoft Excel and calculated the obtained changes coinciding between -r < 005 and r < 0001
Statistical analysis of the results of the study was performed through Microsoft Office Excel 2007
The results of the study showed that 5 days after alloxan administration, the glucose content in the control group rat lymph increased to 64 mmol/l, and in the test group rat lymph increased to 136 mmol/l
45 days after alloxan administration, it was found that the glucose content in the lymph increased by 229 ± 35 mmol/l (1 Table) [7]
Glucose content in lymph of rats with alloxan diabetes
Pancreatic R cells secrete insulin with its hypoglycemic properties
Lower insulin content 77 ± 08 μME/ml in the lymph of observed rats in our experiments
In rats of the 2nd test group, 5 days after alloxan administration, the insulin content in the lymph decreased and after 45 days it reached -30 ± 06 μME/ml (Histogram 1)
Thus, we obtained a rat alloxane diabetes sample
This proves the following indicator: an increase in glucose in the lymph and a rapid decrease in insulin in the blood
A change in lymph values 30 days after alloxan administration to rats indicates a decrease in lymph formation processes, which led to a decrease in lymphoethics
Reduced transport services of lymphatic systems and lymph formation processes enhances the passage of alloxan diabetes
Decreased activity of sudden and induced contraction of neck and neck lymph nodes in alloxan diabetes identified in our practices can exacerbate diabetes passage by negatively affecting the rotation of drainage and organ exchange products
Measurements in rats of group 2 showed a decrease in body weight by 10-12% from the moment of alloxan administration after 30 days
With an average body weight of intact rats of 235 ± 15 g in rats of the 2nd group with alloxane diabetes, the average body weight was reduced from 210 ± 12 g.
Part of rats of the 2nd group died
10% of the total number of primary rats died
30 days after alloxan administration to rats, the lymphatic flow of the intestinal lymphatic branch was 020 ± 002 ml/h, which is lower than the level of controlled rats
032 ± 004 ml/h
There is a 30% decrease in lymphatic flow
In the lymph, it was below 77 ± 08 μME/ml
In group 2 rats, 5 days after alloxan administration, the insulin content in the blood decreased and after 45 days reached 60 ± 07 μME/ml
Thus, we obtained biochemical indicators of lymph and blood plasma in the development of alloxan diabetes

In rats with alloxan diabetes, after 30 days, the viscosity of Lymph was lower than in blood, due to the low protein content in the lymph and the lack of platelets
At the same time, fibrinogen levels in the lymph were low
Quantitative indicators are shown in table 2
According to the results of our experience, there is a decrease in the total protein content in lymph by 22% and 21% compared to observation
It can be assumed that a decrease in total protein in rat lymph is associated with a decrease in protein synthesis in liver, which led to a decrease in filtration and uptake processes, respectively, to a decrease in lymphatic flow and lymph formation processes from intestinal lymphatic runoff (Table 3)
Dynamics of rat lymph biochemical index in diabetes mellitus
A similar circumstance is described by other authors of liver disorders in rats with alloxan diabetes
Thus, we obtained a rat alloxane diabetes sample
This proves the following indicator: an increase in glucose in the lymph and a rapid decrease in insulin in the blood
A change in lymph values 30 days after alloxan administration to rats indicates a decrease in lymph formation processes, which led to a decrease in lymphoethics
Reduced transport services of lymphatic systems and lymph formation processes enhances the passage of alloxan diabetes
Decreased activity of sudden and induced contraction of neck and neck lymph nodes in alloxan diabetes identified in our practices can exacerbate diabetes passage by negatively affecting the rotation of drainage and organ exchange products
The channel of portable lymph node activity in Alloxan diabetes, in our opinion, may be associated primarily with impaired carbon metabolism and impaired membrane function of smooth muscle lymph node cells
Thus, the results of our practices showed the following: in alloxan diabetes, about 50% pressure was exerted on the carrying activities of lymph vessels and nodes, especially in places where there was a decrease in the frequency of sharp contractions and a simultaneous decrease in amplitude.
The activity of lymph node contractions in rats was under pressure due to disorders in the receptor apparatus of the nodes, which in turn indicates a deterioration in the transport and drainage activities of the lymph system
The widespread spread of diabetes mellitus in modern culture is one of our main problems
In this regard, in the course of the rat study, we examined the twentieth activity of lymph nodes in normal and diabetes mellitus
The study carried out 60 laboratory studies of white rats: 1st controlled (10 rats) 2nd tested (40 rats)
Alloxane under skin of the second group (15 mg/100g)
Lymph vascular lymph composition on stomach determined by ether anesthesia in all rats
This is proved by the following indicators: an increase in glucose in the lymph and a rapid decrease in insulin in the blood
A change in lymph values 30 days after alloxan administration to rats indicates a decrease in lymph formation processes, which led to a decrease in the lymphatic flow
Reduced transport services of lymphatic systems and lymph formation processes enhances the passage of alloxan diabetes
Measurements in Group 2 rats showed a 10-12% reduction in body weight since alloxane administration after 30 days
With an average body weight of intact rats of 235 ± 15 g in rats of the 2nd group with alloxane diabetes, the average body weight was reduced from 210 ± 12 g.
Part of rats of the 2nd group died
10% of the total number of primary rats died
During the study we made the following conclusions:
5 days after alloxan administration, rats rapidly increased the amount of glucose in the blood and lymph, after 30 days glucosuria appeared, insulin levels in the blood and lymph decreased, which in turn allowed to obtain a model of diabetes alloxan, which generally needs insulin
Pancreatic P cells form and excret insulin with its hypoglycemic properties
Insulin content 205 ± 18 μME/ml in blood plasma in controlled rats in our experiments
Total plasma protein concentration in Group 3 rats receiving soybean milk and a-tocopherol, as seen from the data obtained after rat antioxidant corrections, was transferred but did not reach control level
Hematocritical index is within reference value
Group 3 blood obesity slightly increased compared to group 2 not obtained by antioxidants

Currently, many regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan are characterized by environmental instability
These include the natural complex of the Ili-Balkash region
Agricultural production energy fisheries housing and utilities, etc.
dynamically evolving
In the natural complex Il-Balkhash, 13% of agriculture 44% of fish farming 75% is in the food industry
However, environmental problems in the territory negatively affect the socio-economic development of the region
Ili Balkhash water massif is located in Balkhash Alakol district
Length - 501 thousand square kilometers - width 605 - from 9 to 74 kilometers
And the deepest - 26 meters
The lake is located in desert and desert belts, as its climate is sharply continental
Ili Balkhash massif - a region rich in historical and natural monuments in Kazakhstan
There are reserves in this region, such as the Sharyn Gora River, stone statues and the ancient Sand Kum mound system, Altynemel Kerbulak National Park
Largest cities - Almaty Taldykorgan Zharkent
The population in the Kazakh part of the Field is about 33 million people.
is a person
The bulk of them live in Almaty region and amount to 16 million.
is a person
The share of river water is 14% of the water of reservoirs - 5%
Water supply for irrigation of irrigated land on the area (more than 600 thousand hectares) is carried out using more than 2 thousand hydraulic structures, including 50 large irrigation units
15 million tenge in rural areas
a person lives
It consists of more than 90 inter-farm and intra-farm reservoirs, which include the Kapshagay dam, the total area of ​ ​ which is about 20 km3 [23]
During the study of this topical topic, unstable environmental factors were identified
The current state of water resources of Kazakhstan is characterized by a sharp increase in the impact of man-made factors
The violation of the law of equilibrium in the natural system of the Ili River water mass has a great influence of the anthropogenic factor on their current changes
Use of water quality in areas of ecological disturbance of irrigated land
deterioration of technology and protection is local or non-regional worldwide [4]
The main reason for the Ilya-Balkhash problem is the contradiction between the widespread use of the water resources of the massif rivers for the development of hydropower and irrigated agriculture and the need to maintain the mineral content of West Balkhash, primarily as the main source of water supply and water supply
Measures to stop pollution of its watershed to maintain the sustainable ecological state of the lake and to ensure the influx of rivers feeding it from China and, most importantly, the tributary of the Ili River are very important.
The main pollutants in the Ile-Balkhash region: rice farming in the floodplain of the Ile Sh and Karatal rivers
200 million tons of collection and drainage water containing organic nitrogen and floating substances from these farms
more than cubic meters and include cities and settlements with communal institutions
The further deterioration of the Balkhash ecosystem is also affected by the Kapshagai reservoir, built along the Ili River
In 1970, the Kapshagay dam was built on the Kapshagay reservoir
In addition to it, the Shelek River, which feeds the Ile River, blocked the Bartogai dam, where 300 thousand m3 of water accumulated
So the Big Almaty Canal was built
Shelek River stopped flowing into Ilega due to the construction of a canal
Lake Balkhash has dropped by almost 2 meters in recent years
Thus, the shores of the lake are swampy and turn into deserts and deserts
Fauna and flora of the Ile-Balkhash ecosystem suffer
Fishing in recent years has decreased by 5 times, the number of spawning has decreased (Kapshagai reservoir)
Also, fish poisoning with pesticide residues of herbicides and mineral fertilizers used in crops along Or is often observed.
Therefore, it was decided to limit the filling of the Kapshagai reservoir and its design capacity will be 16-18 km3 instead of 28 km3
In the future, the filling of the reservoir was stopped to comprehensively study the negative environmental consequences of this project and take measures to stop it
At the same time, water supply from industries supplying water to Balkhash has been significantly reduced, including primarily from Ile to irrigated agriculture and water consumption [56]
In 1999, the international environmental forum "Saving Lake Balkhash Today and the Future" was held.
It considered the issues of saving Lake Balkhash and made concrete decisions
The main ones are:
regulating the efficient use of water in production sites along the Or River;
stabilization of the share of water directed from the Kapshagai reservoir to Balkhash;
Reduction of rice areas in Akdala massifs;
Operation of groundwater;
Limitation of irrigated land [7]
Salvation of Lake Balkhash - today's demand
Loss of aquatic ecosystems, such as Aral and Balkhash, can turn not only Kazakhstan, but also Eurozia into a place of unprecedented ecological disaster
Therefore, protecting and protecting every natural ecosystem is a child's duty
To communicate with nature, firstly, it is necessary to implement a number of measures that meet the goals of protecting the environment of production
Environmental measures can produce results only when all countries work together to protect nature
Another measure aimed at improving the relationship between man and nature is the application of a certain amount of consumption of natural resources
The formation of ecological consciousness of the population consists of a number of issues of compulsory environmental education and education
They-ecological scientific consciousness needs to form environmental ethics, environmental psychology and environmental legal consciousness

Some methods of application of information computer technologies in the training of students in Ecology
This article describes the role of innovative technologies in the educational process, as well as in training
outlining the main directions and forms of innovative transformation
Privatization and classification of humanization of the learning process are considered the main principles of the innovative educational institution.
Innovative learning technologies include: interactive learning technologies, project learning technology and computer technologies
The use of information computer technology (ICT) in environmental classes will improve the quality of training in disciplines; Advancing the characteristics of the investigated natural objects and phenomena, which are considered quite important from the point of view of the goals and objectives of training in the development of visual positions with the disclosure of the semantic aspects of various forms
One of the advantages of using multimedia learning technologies is to improve the quality of training due to increased interest in working with a computer
The use of a computer in classes has become a new method of organizing active and conscious actions of students, thereby opening up opportunities for interesting environmental classes
Innovative technologies of educational process information computer technologies
Ecological culture Ecological education ecological consciousness noosphere ecological morality of man-made environmental disasters
A leading place in the formation of consciousness in the education of the mind and feelings in the disclosure of the moral aspect of the relationship between man and nature is occupied by the ecological culture of man
The need to educate environmental culture was determined in the 70s of the XX century
On the one hand, this is due to the introduction of environmental knowledge in secondary schools, and on the other hand, a deep environmental crisis will contribute to the breakdown of harmony in the environment
We know that environmental crises due to global man-made disasters are human actions when irresponsibility dominates consciousness
Therefore, in the context of the greening of the economy, the task of lawmaking and the formation of an ecological culture of the individual in society comes first (Concept of Environmental Safety of the Republic of Kazakhstan from 2004 to 2015 Concept of the transition of the Republic of Kazakhstan to intensive development from 2007 to 2024 Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan and other documents) [1]
For the first time, the term "ecology of culture" was received by academician D.
Likhachev introduced it in 1980
The objective basis of human life, created, in his opinion, by the factor of morality - the preservation of heritage, therefore, the ecology of culture is considered as a moral ecology
He warned that in case of non-compliance with the legislation of the ecology of culture, this will lead to a moral spiritual decline in society
Classical definition of ecological culture Russian scientist
He defined ecological culture as "a special part of general culture, expressing the nature and qualitative level of relations between society and nature, reflecting the results of human actions directly related to the development and renewal of the system of all types of social institutions and nature within a certain social unit"
This view E
Girusov, supporting, defines culture as "a combination of material and spiritual values, as well as human actions that ensure the advancement of society," and considers environmental culture as part of a general culture that is "the reason for the environment to meet the requirements of life" social activity
Vector of direction of human development with quality qualities of ecological culture according to Vernadsky
His ideas play an important role in the formation of a modern human worldview, gaining its place in nature and
responsibility for the future of the biosphere plays an important role in shaping a new environmental morality and ethics
The source of the problem of ecological culture is the idea of ​ ​ historical relations between society and nature
The axiological direction of research used by a society that reveals the values ​ ​ of the environment is of particular importance
Its personal aspects:

In foreign pedagogy, a disciplinary approach is clearly manifested, providing for the greening of general education based on a change in the structure of educational means
Current receipt of ecosocial issues P
The Swiss plays an important role in the proceedings, forms the methodological basis of any socio-environmental research on the merits [2]
Based on the above definitions, the concept of "ecological culture" can be formulated as follows: ecological culture is an important part of human culture, reflected in all spiritual life and business, characterizing the ways in which society interacts not only with the natural environment, but also with the social historical environment, and the exceptional property of a person characterized by an environmentally conscious environmental attitude to the environment with a system of environmental education that understands the value of nature
Ecological action is characterized by changing and preserving human knowledge of the natural environment
It is a rationally decisive factor in the environmental problems that form the basis of ecological culture
For example, greening production in the field of technology in the economy - estimating the costs of new changes in the environment in science - accumulating intellectual forces around the environmental problem in the field of law - creating legislation for the protection of nature in pedagogy - forming a style of ecological thinking and character, etc.
The content of environmental education is determined by the specifics of ecological culture
The main issues of environmental education include: deepening and expanding environmental knowledge; education of cognitive behaviour; development of social creative and cognitive focus of students in the course of environmental activities; formation of environmental feeling
Environmental knowledge mastered by an individual in the process of structural formation of ecological culture becomes the rules of trust and behavior, determines the nature of its activities in the natural environment
Relevant and fundamental in the study of ecological culture and its structural phenomenon is the direction of cultural studies, which has approaches to the study of social and environmental relations: functional noosphere landscape-anthropological civilization and ethnocultural social philosophy
Figure 1
Structure of ecological culture of the individual
The source of material values ​ ​ to the ecological culture of the individual (Fig. 1), as Pechko shows, is the basis of environmental living conditions, including emotionally
culture of cognitive actions of humanity in mastering experience in communication with nature, as a form of aesthetic influence; The culture of work formed in the course of work; can be attributed to the culture of spiritual relations with nature [4]
Formation of ecological culture A common indicator of environmental education is the development of the student's personality in the field of intellectual emotional activity
The problem of environmental education in pedagogy and the education of a student of an ecological worldview, the environmental task of self-consciousness and self-knowledge and responsibility for environmental practice, the environmental practice of motivated interest and participation in setting environmental-motivated works, environmental knowledge and skills are studied in various positions as a structure of ecological culture, that is, ethnopedagological and psychological methodological, as pan-European worldview values
The study of environmental culture issues on axe research is carried out in various directions: the importance of knowledge in the formation of ecological culture; peculiarities of human and natural communication, ensuring human life and development; developing environmental knowledge that reveals the characteristics of human-environmental relations that reflect environmental issues; development of ecological consciousness; determining the connection of moral education of ethics with attitude to nature and spiritual value; Methods and types of organization of environmental activities [5]
Environmental education is a conscious and systematic development of ideas about the environment at all stages of human life, purposefully aimed at the development of consciousness, which will contribute to the preservation and development of the environment, ensuring the harmonious existence of man today and in the future.
Glazachev's opinion that the center of the continuing environmental education system is the university
Because the role of pedagogical universities is determined by the level of training of specialists responsible for the education of the younger generation
An example of a system for the formation of ecological culture of students through interdisciplinary communication in the training process based on a generalized analysis of the best practices of teachers of scientific and theoretical labor and experimental work was considered
This system consists of personal-motivational substantive organizational procedural-behavioral components, built in taxonomy based on ideas of interdisciplinary connection, aimed at formation of ecological culture of personality [6]
Ensures the periodicity and development of knowledge and skills among students of the content and structure of the system, created on an interdisciplinary basis
The scope and complexity of the knowledge and skills that enable the formation of an environmental culture in this case should be provided consistently

Beisenova A.
Kushenova J
Zhatkanbaeva and
and without attention
Sarybekov during the socio-philosophical study of environmental knowledge substantiated the relationship of such scientific areas as environmental philosophy, environmental psychology and environmental pedagogy as its methodological basis
According to its definition, environmental pedagogy is a new promising methodological direction of pedagogical science, which determines the criteria for methods and forms of content and principles of environmental knowledge
The relationship between ecology and pedagogy is defined as follows: ecology reflects the general problem that arises in the context of an environmental crisis, on the basis of which environmental pedagogy determines the volume of educational skills necessary for mastering at each stage of education, constituting the specific content of pedagogical education
Sarmanova rightly points out that the formation of environmental responsibility is carried out only in the process of environmental activity as personal quality
Because responsible communication and behavior arise under the influence of a system of specific skills consistent with moral values ​ ​ and beliefs
The author considers important the principle of education through environmental reality "Large-scale thinking
- local implementation "[7]
The updating of school textbooks in the works of Beissenova classifies the basic principles of environmental education, paying great attention to environmental education
The main tasks related to ecology are that the environment can be performed by qualified teachers with higher education and
"First, environmental education and education on the harmony between society and human ecology are necessary.
Second, teachers must nurture a sense of responsibility among students that they can anticipate an environmental crisis
Thirdly, conduct special courses through the institutes of improvement and retraining of teachers teaching environmental issues and ecology
Fourth, state-of-the-art technology refers to specific measures to computerize learning and ensure the implementation of updated learning methods "[8]
And on environmental education in Kazakhstan science
Sarmurzina has a great contribution to the development of a scientific school
Together with representatives of his school, he substantiated the structure of the course of environmentally sound chemistry on systemicity and created the theory of the gradual development of mental actions
Greening, in his opinion, at each stage of training necessarily corresponds to one of the characteristic structural, in particular motivational cognitive emotional-free practical components
Sarmurzina's study highlights the importance of higher education in a holistic system of continuous environmental personal training
He proposed introducing environmental compulsory education in all universities, as well as introducing active forms and methods of training - modular training, widely using role-playing and imitation games, telecommunications and computer technology [9]
Environmental education in universities will be implemented at a professional level
15 universities have environmental-related faculties with more than 1,000 students
Every year the number increases
International requirements for the training of environmental specialists are presented only at the Kazakh State Academy of Architecture and Construction of KazUPU named after Abay al-Farabi in Almaty.
Stored at Buketov State University only at Semipalatinsk State Pedagogical University [10]
Although the definition of the subject and objectives of environmental education in higher education institutions is different, they all form an active position in the recognition and protection of the environment and require the involvement of the younger generation in solving environmental problems
Environmental education is universal and multidisciplinary in nature
It must therefore be consistent with all forms of general education
The issue of developing ecological qualifications based on ecological culture occupies an important place in geographical science.
Because at the present stage, geography is between nature and society, covering natural and social issues in general; a science that considers the optimism of relationships
Therefore, the study of nature is one of the most important tasks of physical geography - the formation of a system of environmental qualifications of students
Currently, environmental education in universities acquires the status of a priority area of ​ ​ activity of future specialists responsible for the formation of environmental culture

Non-invasive second type glucose methods of pancreatic diabetes mellitus
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - Head of State N
In his Address to the People of Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan - 2050: Common Interests of One Future," Nazarbayev set a task to increase the life expectancy of Kazakhstanis to 80 years during the development of medicine for the preservation of a healthy lifestyle [1]
One of the current problems impeding the realization of this particular task is the group of patients who call "diseases of metabolic disorders" or "non-communicable diseases"
Atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases among them
One of the most dangerous is the frequent impairment of pancreatic function - diabetes [2]
Diabetes mellitus is a disease that occurs due to the lack of this hormone with a slight removal of insulin by pancreatic beta cells and is characterized for this reason by a carbohydrate disorder, especially of all types of metabolism [3]
Diabetes mellitus and complications often lead to premature death of a person with a disability, worsening the quality of life, gaining not only medical, but also high social importance
Currently, 5-6% of the total population suffers from diabetes, but according to independent experts of the International Diabetes Federation, this figure is currently 835%
382 million people have diabetes mellitus on Earth, and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the world is currently projected by experts to be 592 million by 2035.
sufficient [4]
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every 10-15 years the number of patients with diabetes in advanced economies increases by 2 times
274 thousand patients with diabetes are currently registered in medical institutions of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Their number is growing every day and in the first half of this year more than six thousand patients were registered
Increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus among children and adolescents has been a concern for scientists and doctors in recent years [5]
If the incidence of diabetes mellitus increases at this rate, then in 2030 it is expected that the number of registered will reach 750 thousand.
And in medical institutions, if we count with unaccounted for, then the number of patients is 1 million.
per thousand
In diabetes mellitus, metabolism is disrupted due to insufficient insulin formation (type 1 diabetes mellitus) or impaired effect on tissue (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that diabetes mellitus occurs more often than type 2
Type II diabetes mellitus develops as a result of insulin resistance
In the tissues of organs (fatty muscle of the liver) there are insulin receptors of insulin action
After interaction of receptors with insulin, glucose penetration in tissues increases dramatically
In the pathology of insulin receptors, their interaction with insulin is disrupted and tissue resistance to insulin develops
In this case, since insulin release is not reduced, it is called relative insulin deficiency
In most cases, insulin receptor activity is observed in obesity
On the other hand, overeating leads to an increase in blood glucose
Glucose cannot enter the cell due to lack of tissue sensitivity to insulin
This requires a large amount of insulin, so the pancreas begins to produce an excess amount of insulin, as a result of which the cells become hypertrophic and diabetes mellitus develops
Risk of inheritance of type II seeds of diabetes mellitus 40%
Sometimes type II diabetes mellitus develops in adolescents and young people who inherit 50-80% of the seeds
Diabetes mellitus differs from other endocrine diseases not only in the wide spread, but also in the frequency of complications
Chronic hyperglycemia developing in diabetes mellitus is characterized by complications of cardiac bleeding expressed by the renal and nervous systems from many organs and systems
Diabetes mellitus in 70-80% of cases leads to cardiovascular cerebrovascular diseases and vision pathology
Heart disease in 2-fold 10-fold growth of gangrene and amputation of limbs 15-40 times
The main causes of disability will be diabetes complications such as retinopathy nephropathy, polyneuropathy diabetes
Diabetes mellitus increases mortality among people due to various complications that develop with the disease, causing significant harm to public health
According to WHO, the annual number of deaths from diabetes mellitus is 45 million people
It is assumed that by 2030 this disease will cause one in seven deaths on Earth
Diabetes mellitus carries high economic costs
According to specially calculated estimates by WHO experts, in 2012 alone, the cost of this amounted to $471 billion.
USA
Last year in our country, an average of 220 thousand tenge was spent on the treatment of one of the patients with diabetes mellitus from the budget
And if the patient is sitting in the insula, then about 250 thousand tenge will be spent on this
Then about half a million tenge will be spent on one patient, if it is increased by 274 thousand patients with diabetes mellitus, then it will be possible to make sure how much diabetes will cause big losses to the country's economy
In view of the above, WHO, by supporting the prevention and control of diabetes mellitus and its complications and the effective implementation of epidemiological control, is committed to implementing in all States, especially in weak and medium-developed countries with high rates of diabetes mellitus.
To prevent diabetes mellitus and its complications, it is important to carry out the necessary preventive measures in a timely manner with high-quality control over the progress of early detection of the disease
In improving patient's quality of life, early detection of diabetes complications in vessels reduces disability and mortality
It is worth noting that no disease has a close connection with laboratory studies, such as diabetes mellitus, since in the course of laboratory studies diagnosis and treatment are carried out.
With timely monitoring of the blood glucose level of a person with diabetes mellitus, it is allowed to prevent dangerous complications of the disease or reduce their harm to health
Knowing the amount of glucose with simple available and highly accurate methods keeps millions healthy, revealing pathological changes that cause diabetes
There are 2 ways to determine the amount of glucose in the body: blood for an invasive (direct) study
requires and does not require non-invasive (indirect) blood sampling
Relative accuracy of invasive method is considered high, deviation less than 15%
Currently, in everyday medical practice, reductometric colorometric and enzyme invasion methods are used to determine the amount of glucose in the blood.
Very rarely used due to the low accuracy of the previous two methods, and the enzyme method is often used in clinical practice due to safety and high accuracy
However, to get blood, it is necessary to burden the skin, and this procedure is unsafe
For constant blood collection for the above purposes, especially the second type of diabetes mellitus, lethargy in the patient's vessels increases the risk of transmission of various transmissible diseases
In this regard, the introduction of non-invasive methods to diagnose and monitor the course of the second type of diabetes mellitus is now a pressing issue [67]
The application of non-invasive studies for this purpose began to be put into practice after the determination of the amount of glucose in the blood is often carried out in diabetes mellitus
They contain methods for analyzing the air content during breathing and determining the amount of glucose according to the level of blood pressure [8]
For the determination of diabetes mellitus by non-invasive methods, except blood as biological material
applicable [910]
One of the invasive methods proposed in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is based on a study of the composition of human respiratory air
American scientists Mby Armstrong and Wang Chui proposed a way to assess blood glucose by determining the amount of acetone - one of the residual products of hydrocarbon metabolism in respiratory air
To control glucose levels in this way, a special remedy was created
In the closed chamber from the mirror of the tool wall, the amount of acetone is determined in accordance with the rate of disconnection of laser infrared radiation
The tool allows you to determine the 045 part of acetone in one million units of air
Research by scientists using a special tool has shown that in the vast majority of cases of diabetes mellitus, this figure is 14
Currently, this agent can use daily control of the amount of glucose in the blood with its improvement in the future, although only to determine the presence of diabetes.
Scientists at Brown University, as one of the non-invasive indicators, came up with biochips in which you can determine the amount of glucose in human saliva and control the course of diabetes mellitus
This will create a tool for checking glucose levels without giving a blood test
High sensitivity of the instrument in determining the difference in saliva glucose doses of different people
According to a university assistant professor, the sensitivity of this method to determining the amount of glucose in the blood is 10 times greater than the sensitivity to determining the level of glucose in the blood, since the mechanism of operation of the new chip is based on plasma interferonosetry with specific chemical reactions
The biochip is made of quartz coated with a thin shell of silver, the area of ​ ​ which is equal to the square of an inch.
The device is equipped with detectors capable of detecting a very small amount of sensitive glucose
Saliva is known to contain salts other than water (99%), enzymes and other substances (remaining 1%)
Given this, the researchers used a plasma interferonometry method to determine the amount of such glucose using chemical dyes that are markers of glucose
At the same time, the sensitivity of the instrument is high: the physiological concentration of glucose can determine concentration changes of 01 μmol/1 liter in the range of 20-240 μm
So, a big step was taken in the development of non-invasive methods for diagnosing diabetes mellitus and monitoring the progress of the disease
As one of the non-invasive methods for determining type 2 diabetes mellitus, tests of DNA samples of intestinal bacteria can be used.
Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Genomics (BGI) in China analyzed 60 thousand bacterial markers of sick and healthy people and found that diabetes patients have features in the structure of intestinal bacteria
The development of a new direction of "metagenomics" of this science became possible during the study of DNA samples of individual colonies of microorganisms
Studies have shown that patients with 2 types of diabetes mellitus develop a moderate imbalance in the intestinal microflora, while bacteria "producing butyrate," on the contrary, increase the "opportunistic pathogen"
This can cause increased resistance of the intestinal microflora to the drugs used in diseases of type 2 diabetes mellitus
Scientists believe that research can be used to detect diabetes mellitus
To this end, one of the leaders of this scientific project, University of Copenhagen professor Oluf Borby Pedersen, is going to introduce type 2 gut bacteria of diabetes mellitus into mice and find out whether diabetes mellitus develops, or whether gut bacteria are a sign of diabetes mellitus
Scientists at the Chihuahua State Institute of Technology in Mexico have developed the Glucosalarm tool to determine glucose levels in the body by urine analysis in order to develop non-invasive approaches when examining diabetes mellitus
This was done as part of a joint study by Carlos Bernal and Nancy Guerra
Carlos Bernal observed that in order to get blood from the finger to determine glucose levels, it is difficult to work 3-4 days with increased pain and finger disease at several times a day.
Now data on chemical reactions are transmitted to the smartphone to determine the amount of glucose when a person receives several drops of urine.
To determine the concentration of glucose and get information about its level, it takes only 15-40 seconds on a smartphone
If the amount of glucose is set at a sufficiently high level of danger, this is reported to the treating doctor in his family to call an ambulance
It is worth noting that the Glucosalarm tool is recognized as the best 10 achievements in the field of health care and won more than 900 technological innovations presented at competitions in the field of science and technology
Tomsk scientists, together with specialists from Samsung Corporation, are developing the Glucoscan tool for determining blood glucose using a non-invasive method
To perform the analysis, place the finger on a special tool panel or place the receiving part of the tool on the end of the ear
After a few seconds, the patient receives a message about the level of glucose in his blood
Determination of glucose levels does not cause pain and is safe due to the fact that the skin of the finger is performed by the spur
Therefore, the patient can control the glucose level during the day
Thus, the relevance of the widespread use of non-invasive methods in research on the detection of diabetes mellitus and the prevention of its complications increases every year
They have several advantages over invasive methods
First, the study of non-invasive indicators does not allow the spread of infectious diseases infected with a non-dangerous blood pathogen
Secondly, when examined, the patient's skin and vessels are not injured, so there are no negative feelings

Some test grouping questions
This article is intended to test the prediction system for assessing the quality of problem recognition and achieving a human goal.
In the general grouping of tests, it is acceptable to use the opposite reverse direction, including from general to individual when compiling the test
Questions of grouping and systematization of the test come out of private interdisciplinary interest
From the data provided in a good understanding of the grouping of tests, one can note the most described point of contact, which will help solve the problem of the general systematization of tests
This is due to the analysis of the possibility of using psychological tests that will help to better understand the psychophysiological features of the personality, especially important in psychodiagnostics of the personality
Research Methodology for Test Grouping - Intelligent Learning
Informatization system education teacher electronic teaching chemistry professional education chemical element periodic system
In the XXI century, the ongoing changes in the field of education and science pose new challenges for the higher school to prepare educated generations
In this regard, the basic requirement of society is the acquisition by future teachers of knowledge corresponding to the current social educational space, as well as knowledge of personality skills and professional educational qualities.
Only from the educated younger generation come citizens who contribute to the social and cultural prosperity of society and the economy
Therefore, in the Action Plan for 2011-2015 for the implementation of the State Program for the Development of Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020, "The main trends in the development of higher education are the development of innovative knowledge integrated with research activities, close connection of university research with the needs of the social sphere and economy, improvement of educational and information technologies" [1]
Knowledge informatization is now characterized by the widespread dissemination and improvement of information and communication technologies
Informatization of education The introduction of information technologies in all areas of education and the formation of a national model are prerequisites for a qualitative increase in education in the country
In this regard, the teacher must not only master knowledge in the field of information technology, but also be a qualified specialist in using in his professional activities
It should be remembered that knowledge informatization achieves two strategic goals
The first is to improve the efficiency of all types of educational activities based on the use of information technologies, and the second is to improve the quality of training specialists of a new type of thinking in accordance with the requirements of the information society
The future specialist must learn how to use informatization methods and tools to get answers to questions such as where they are, how to communicate with them and use them in order to increase the effectiveness of their professional activities
Modern information technologies and electronic publications overcome shortcomings, preserving all the values ​ ​ of the traditional type of training
At all stages of the training of new information technologies in the research of specialists who train future teachers in practice, lecture qualifications in laboratory classes outside the audience, etc.
[2 3]
Improving the preparation of the future teacher for the use of information technologies in the conditions of informatization of knowledge is one of the most relevant modern requirements of higher education
Knowledge informatization presents a number of the following issues:
introduction of new information technologies into the training process;
improving the level of computer training of students;
Establishment of an information technology e-textbook system for research learning;
creation and development of a single information space of education
Emphasis is now being placed on the development of e-textbooks (EU) based on multimedia technologies and the application of teaching methods
As a prerequisite for the introduction of electronic textbooks on the use of computer technology and informatization of the education system
Nurgaliyeva [6] et al.
considered in his research
An interactive system that allows the user of an electronic textbook to systematically organize and use information
Information and text graphics and information provided by multimedia video and sound effects generated through special programmes for monitoring and assessing knowledge of information and practical materials and tasks of the EU-EU theoretical handbook
Electronic textbook allows a student to use electronic material as an assistant consultant examiner to independently study new disciplines of lecture and qualification laboratory classes
As you know, the use of an electronic textbook in the educational process of the pedagogical education system forms research and research abilities in future teachers
Changes and the amount of knowledge and skills needed to absorb future teachers are constantly growing
In the field of education, research is envisaged on the system of improving the quality of education using electronic textbooks
The use of electronic textbooks in the educational process will make it possible to intensify the educational process in pedagogical practice and increase the system of psychological and pedagogical technologies that improve the ideas for the development of education
The use of e-textbooks has contributed to the emergence of new methods and forms of learning as a new tool for human and learning activities and their rapid introduction into the learning process
Electronic textbook is didactic methodical and interactive software on electronic medium of education, read from computer disk and stored on disk through various forms of information display [7]
The following features of the electronic textbook [8] can be distinguished from Mynbayeva's curricula:
working hours;
Analysis of training material and reports
autonomy;
minority in shape construction
Training in electronic textbooks requires solving psychological and pedagogical educational and methodological problems in the search for ways to cross the new one by the traditional method of processing and introducing the necessary conditions for their improvement
You can distinguish them in various directions:
improvement of a unified scientific and methodological complex to solve the problem of introducing an electronic textbook into the educational process;
creation of the subject of the method of using the electronic textbook in practical activities;
training and introduction of future teachers with an electronic textbook;
material and technical equipment of higher educational institutions;
development and creation of necessary methodological support
The use of electronic textbooks in chemistry lessons will allow students not only to increase cognitive activity, but also to work creatively to create a logical system of thinking
The use of only what the teacher said, or a textbook on the traditional educational system in the field of education, still does not meet modern requirements
Therefore, in the modern century of informatization, it is impossible to advance without the use of electronic textbooks
In this regard, 5B011200 universities - students studying in the specialty "Bachelor of Chemistry," developed an electronic textbook for computer training in phenomena and processes in the sections "Inorganic chemistry" [9 10]
In the periodic system of chemical elements in the content of an electronic textbook
shows the general characteristics of elements, and video laboratories contain a table of test dictionaries
Students who have learned to use computer teaching aids with electronic textbooks can actively work independently
In conclusion, quality control of education through an electronic textbook: checking knowledge, consolidating skills and applying it in practice, the ability to manage your will in diagnosing self-esteem on your educational achievements in solving cognitive problems

State educational standards: laboratory work on chemical experiment at school
"If the teacher cannot fully master science, then students will not be able to doubt science, then the teacher's work in this area will be unsuccessful," D. said.
Mendeleev has a will
In addition, at present, in order to give students a high-quality education and conscious education, the teacher needs daily selfless work on the love of knowledge and life
Among them is a unique place to create scientific practices on the topic of improving the quality of education in the discipline
Involving students within the school to participate in scientific conferences that are able to draw accurate conclusions about the results of scientific research, develops their thinking and responsibility for work
Thanks to this, young people with great demand are becoming more and more invested in the good of a sovereign country - this is pride in our nation
One of the requirements for the level of education of a student who meets the state standard of education is the formation of experimentation skills
Chemistry is a theoretical and experimental subject among natural disciplines that form skills in creating this experience
In accordance with today's curriculum, 70% of chemical discipline will be demonstrated, 30-35% will undergo chemical practice
It is necessary to take into account the individual characteristics of the school, since any of the methods of educational work aims to develop mental knowledge among students.
Famous scientist and teacher I.
Kablukov noted that without conducting research work and practical experience, students cannot be given a high-quality education before teaching only from a textbook.
As you know, a chemical experiment at school is the main means of revealing natural phenomena
Because by experiment, students believe that there are no hidden mysterious phenomena in nature, and they obey natural laws, that knowledge of laws allows widespread use of chemical changes in the practices of human ethics.
The experiment turns the relationship of theory with practice in the process of learning into practical trust in knowledge
During the experiment, students' interest in chemical disciplines is increased and skills are developed in explaining observed phenomena and trends. Currently, four types of chemical experiments are used in secondary school:
demonstration of visual experiments;
laboratory experiments;
qualification works;
production of experimental reports
Each of the listed has corresponding goals according to the individual methodological approach
The purpose of visual practices is to use the technical means available in the school for the most targeted solution, along with an evidence-based interpretation of one chemical phenomenon
To date, schools are equipped with new tools of chemistry rooms
In some cases, these tools require guidance
Because before studying in visual practices, the teacher himself must work with these tools.
By listening to and observing the practices shown by the teacher, students, along with understanding the essence of the phenomenon, get a full understanding of the ways of work and the correct use of equipment in the order of performing separate definitions of the location of tool parts [1]
In school conditions, facilities for a number of classes cannot be presented to students as a trip to production
Because it depends on the safety rules of production
When solving this problem, you can use the virtual lab in electronic textbooks or show excerpts from videos
Therefore, the chemistry room should be equipped with a computer on an interactive board of a new type with a permanent screen, constantly equipped with modern equipment
The main condition of the contracting work is preliminary preparation for it
That is, the student gets acquainted with the characteristic of work in the textbook, the scheme or reference to the installation of equipment and reagents used for the purpose of practice, writes it in chemical language
For rational execution of these issues and time saving it is allowed to prepare maps-drawings for chemical experiments or working notebooks for frame and laboratory works
Due to the large number of students in some classes of schools, a breakdown by qualification groups should be introduced
Teacher cannot pay attention to the safety of all students
In addition, in order to perform high-quality word of mouth and laboratory work, according to the program for simple schools, students need a high-quality methodological guide on teacher notebooks in Kazakh [2]
The main difference between the release of experimental reports and laboratory practices and qualification classes - students perform independently
Teaching students to resolve experimental reports is one of the complex methodological issues
In most cases, teachers are instructed to issue experimental reports at home, such as preparing for master classes
In this case, students have little opportunity to correctly understand the report
Pilot reports should be prepared under the guidance of the classroom teacher
First of all, teach how to plan (matrix) and how to predict results
Including in solving experimental problems, it is necessary to shift the attention of students to:
The calculation should be solved using the least weighted action;
and cheaper and more efficient reagents should be used economically;
apply practical reactions;
obtaining a sample of the substance;
Recording of inspection results during the study
drawing up the correct conclusion in order to verify the results of the work
In addition, in order to connect chemistry with life, it is necessary to introduce household goods into the chemical experiment
Including practical improvement of the knowledge gained by students in the theory of increasing the level of knowledge on obtaining products close to them (for example, demonstration of the extraction of soaps using starch oils from potatoes)
One of the special requirements for a chemical experiment is compliance with technical rules for the safety of students
During Saraman laboratory work, each student must be provided with a simple robe and rubber gloves
Unfortunately, during the experiment, only the teacher puts on a robe, and the student? Therefore, every student must be provided with a robe and rubber gloves at the beginning of the school year, as a school uniform [3]
Improvement of the educational process through full-fledged educational activities of students is one of the important conditions for solving the problems facing the field of education.
In this regard, independent work plays an important role
An experiment in science-intensive works in the chemical discipline of these students is used in many methods, for example, chemical physics - chemical physical technique (weighted analysis of the separation of titrimetric analysis
Republic of Kazakhstan)
And simple studies show that, for example, at home, finding starch in foods is that an apple contains acid in a lemon.
Performing such works will teach the student to be able to apply the obtained theoretical knowledge in life
One of the difficulties teachers encounter in the classroom is the preparation of means of visual or laboratory work in explaining the lesson and	time lag in preparation of solutions with different concentration
To save this time, the chemistry office needs a specialized laboratory assistant, and laboratory assistants must take training courses for laboratory assistants in order to form business skills for working with equipment with reagents [4]
In conclusion, only guided by such pedagogical foundations of teaching chemistry, the lesson gives effective results.
"No person is given knowledge and maturation or can only be realized by words
Everyone who tries to achieve this should strive for it with their own work, "said Disterwerg
Therefore, it is impossible to create a modern scientific appearance of the world until chemistry knows through an experiment

Modular Biology Education at School
The main question discussed in the article is that in modern school biology, in order to clearly understand the exact and exact meaning and significance of the nervous system from the morphology and physiology of humans and animals, students managed to uncover the pedagogical foundations of teaching in high school, which discovered at the evolutionary stage the physiology of anatomy of this system.
The formation of a confident view that the organization of such planning of the subject proposed by the author gives positive results can be motivated by the data obtained by students by testing knowledge of biology
In this article, the author proposes to use the new modular training technology in the training "Nervous System" from school biology and its implementation in conjunction with credit training technology
Such training and training prove that today, according to the results of the education system, it takes place on the basis of an active relationship
Therefore, each biology teacher should especially master this interactive and modular training technology
Modular and credit training of nervous system nerve cell anatomy physiology and evolution
Distance Learning Methodical Complex Linear e-Learning Complex Hypermatin
Open education is a special mature type of full-time evening and distance learning with harmonized elements based on new information technologies and multimedia systems
Modern telecommunications and electronic publications overcome many disadvantages, preserving all the values ​ ​ of the traditional type of training [1]
A form of distance learning independent of time and space bands, a method of performing continuous continuous general education of the majority with the formation of mutual exchange of information
Therefore, this system consists of people with different social conditions (students - citizens with disabilities or military unemployed
) and ensures the right of the population to education and information in any part of the country and abroad
The use of updating technologies in the study of theoretical chemistry courses or some sections of distance learning is one of the pressing problems of the modern chemical educational paradigm
Therefore, the purpose of our work is to study the specifics of preparing educational materials for organic chemistry courses for distance education
The main difference between distance learning and distance education is that the second method provides a systematic and effective interactive educational process using information technologies
Network training system is created on the basis of content and goals of face-to-face training
And the type of provision of educational materials is organized completely differently from the relationship of the teacher and the student with the students (2 3]
This method should be perceived as a modern new form of education
The distance learning system creates the conditions for individual and group training, requiring that there is feedback between the student and the teacher in order to teach and organize a clear and accurate planning of the student's actions, as well as anticipation of the necessary educational foundation that ensures the trainee's interactivity
The most common forms of distance learning identified through our literature analysis are interactive television; computer telecommunications network (regional global); online occupation of existing configuration (text files multimedia video conferencing telepikir)
) on various didactic possibilities; Internet and CD sharing technologies [4-8]
In the course of the study of some existing system technologies of training abroad and in Kazakhstan, we compared the peculiarities of conducting a network educational process
Depending on the goals, the training process can be organized differently
For example, if we consider distance learning in Europe, then a remote education system in Europe is a state
in funded universities
The use of computer and communication technologies has recently been widespread
Distance learning in the United States began to develop in the mid-60s of the last century
Some American engineering colleges have switched to using television to show training courses to employees of nearby corporations
These programs led to the emergence of the National University of Technology
Over time, he became a consortium of 40 engineering schools in Fort Collins, Colorado
1,100 students mastered the program of the National University of Technology in the early 90s
South Carolina State uses Lotus Learning Space [5]
For example, at the University of Illinois in the American city of Urbana-Champaign since 2008, they have been remotely studying organic chemistry
Students can discuss learning issues while sharing views with each other and with the teacher 3 hours a week
Course takes place in two formats
The first type of students in the summer listens to lectures in groups through the Internet (50 min), the second - for students who did not have time to replace the lecture in the fall, educational material is provided in the form of a segment of 6 5-6 minutes on each topic
After mastering the educational material, the exam is conducted synchronously
They are currently collaborating with Beijing University
For example, students at two universities at the same time as Professor D.
Listening to Zhao's lecture, together discussing the mechanisms of reaction, conducts the educational process in direct connection with each other [6]
In Kazakhstan, from the beginning of 2006, the portal "Modular Object Oriented Digital Learning Environment (MOODLE)" was opened at the Republican Center for Informatization of Education (RBAO)
This project is being implemented within the framework of the UNESCO project "Distance learning using information and communication technologies (ICT) for secondary schools in remote regions" and aims at improving the quality of education
MOODLE - an open package of programs designed for remote effective training
This system has international GPL (General Public Licence) permission to copy and distribute this material for free reproduction
Moodle allows you to get as connected as possible to the replacement of knowledge in the organization of training in the process of joint solving of educational tasks [7]
If we consider Kazakhstani universities, then in the Kazakh National University named after al-Farabi, the technology of distance education begins with the application of "Accounting and Auditing" to students studying in the correspondence department of training in the process of training (specialties in economics and business for the higher school "Law Faculty") and those abroad under programs of passing scientific and practical practice
In order to ensure a remote educational process, electronic educational materials using modern computer technologies are being developed [8-10]
A group of students on the network technology of placing educational materials on the Lotus Learning Space server, designed for their own training in asynchronous mode, read the first-year program at the Kazakh National Technical University
The use of synchronous mode, of course, is more complex, for this it was necessary first of all to provide well-developed technical equipment and to conduct special training of the teaching staff [9]
Kazakh-Russian University uses innovative methods of teaching many elements of remote educational technology: slide lectures, e-textbook training programs, computer training
As a result of linear training, students in various humanities are issued a certificate [5 8]
The distance learning system has more methodological features compared to the normal type of training
The scheme of organization of distance education is compiled using other information and methodological technologies
Educational methodological document is called online educational-methodical information complex taking into account these features
The creation of these complexes, as well as the organization of the educational process, will be carried out in a practically difficult way
In higher educational institutions, the educational process should have a unique system of equipping educational materials
The method of implementation of such a system should be provided with high-quality educational resources of virtual education, primarily with the help of designers and tutors, except for special teachers
In the implementation of this goal by the authors for the creation of JCPOA
all faculty of the university considers it necessary to participate in structural and executive departments
The constant requirement for the didactic supply of the educational process through educational programs using distance learning technology is to be based on the standard programs of compulsory disciplines to the State general mandatory standards of education, which are supplemented and updated in each specialty after five years, and the standard educational methodological complexes adopted at the university (CAS)
In general, as in the Higher Attestation Commission, the main goal of VTsIOM is to didactically equip the educational process in the educational system so that the result of obtaining education corresponds to a certain required level
Network educational and methodological information complex is created in a technological and technical interactive form with a didactic program for education in a developed society
TsARIC includes: information about the author; work program of the course; methodological guidelines for mastering the topics of independent work on the course; test question base; electronic library covered by additional training resources
[4 9]
The table below shows a comparison of the differences from the Abay version of the normal Central Administrative Commission of the last sample approved at the Kazakh National Pedagogical University (Table 1)

Student self-employment (using a complete system of context-sensitive help and aids) in interactive electronic form
By comparing the complexes specified in the table, one can see the differences in CICA in the following form
Firstly, the educational and methodological complex in the remote education system can be transported by various pedagogical and methodological information and technological means
Secondly,
both training materials and test self-test tasks in a differentially oriented form are transmitted taking into account the ability and demand of each student
In order for each student to receive complete information in accordance with the level of their development, the encyclopedia precedent is used, that is, hyperlinks to international funds (banks) of information are additionally indicated to in-depth sources of electronic literature.
From the second specifics there is an interest in creating copyright courses, where for teachers-compilers of educational works there is always an opportunity to creatively change the types and content of the complex.
Therefore, university teachers will have new ideas and stages of applying updating technologies in the vehicle, which will create high-quality JCPOA
During the pedagogical practice, the teacher may conduct one semester or educational material in the form of application of additional updating technology to the normal training system without maintaining elements of linear training for the full course, including for certain sections [10]
The linear training complex should be based on highly qualified specialists in the preparation of educational materials
But the teacher is largely hindered by the implementation of the JCPOA, since drawing and organizing the transfer of materials by information technologies do not fall under his direct official duty
Researchers consider the solution to this problem a way to attract specialists of appropriate specialization in the development of JCPOA software
They can be perceived in the regular unit as "Coordinators of distance learning"
Another solution is to create a group of authors from specialists in each industry to create a network educational and methodological information complex [10]
Below is the diagram presented by these authors

In conclusion, the traditional teaching and methodological complex is the basis for the creation of distance educational educational materials
Preparation of course materials in linear training is carried out taking into account the specifics of education
Tasks for the student are formed programmatically technologically and technically interactively with the observance of didactic laws in the normal system, most of the text is made using modern multimedia shows and hyperlinks

Language teaching chemistry at school
This article is an overview and focuses on the most relevant issues of schooling, in particular, bilingual chemistry
The most important system of concepts and terms - the results of the study of chemistry should reflect the skills of the conceptual apparatus and symbolic language as one of the main lines of the so-called chemical language in accordance with the state educational standard
In the process of language teaching, it is a chemical and thematic and educational tool
Language education is the knowledge of a foreign language and the possibility of its advantages in relation to the formation of a chemical language
Today it plays an important role
Language knowledge (costility) contributes to the development of the ability to use a foreign language to obtain additional information from various areas of its work, which forms a bilingual vocabulary on this issue, which contributes to the use of a foreign language as a tool for deepening knowledge of the subject
Language instruction will change the conditions for learning a foreign language using a foreign language
This bilingual teaching of translation into a foreign language, but significantly expands it and does not tolattit
In the article, the concept of "bilingual learning" and language knowledge are certain basic characteristics
Main components of the theoretical model of teaching double chemistry in elementary school classes
models of language education in terms of attitude to the domestic and foreign language
Chemical language knowledge Language language knowledge Methods of teaching bilingual chemistry Teaching methods of teaching bilingual teaching chemistry have an essential component of the target component of irrational and methodical component activity without repeating the model of the procedural component of the effective evaluation component.
The concept of systemic policing is a structural special task
The main objective of the targeted programme for the preparation and publication of textbooks and educational and methodological complexes for general education schools in the Republic of Kazakhstan; N1173, approved by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on September 26, 1996, is the development of textbooks and educational and methodological complexes in subjects, creation of a system of tasks for checking textbooks and teaching aids for textbooks and textbooks, development of concepts of education, which are its constituent 6ӨLІGІ in subjects that provide a basic level of knowledge and skills of students
This objective is achieved by the following main objective:
Here, based on this document, the scientist-methodologist in biology K.
The wool article "What a biology course should be" defines the structural features of a biology course
Changes in the course of biology in the implementation of the GCC RK can be seen in the table below
The following diagram shows the structure of general biological formation in accordance with St. Petersburg State University of Kazakhstan
The Concept of the above structure shows that the structure of the content of general education from biology is determined primarily in accordance with methodological principles and the system of biological science and the possibilities of understanding the social demand of society depending on the age of students
In this context, an evaluation culture, in which the main goal of education in school from biology is understood as the highest value in life, and an evaluation style of thinking, competently orienting biological scientific and cognitive methods and methods of life of wildlife in the scientific way of the world, have properly mastered the system of fundamental biological concepts and produced biological knowledge to protect ecosystems and the diversity of living organisms
This goal will be achieved through specific objectives:
The scientific worldview of students consists in the formation in them of an ethical and aesthetic criterion of attitude to living systems and man as an ideal value of higher value, their familiarization with biology as a cultural phenomenon;
Providing an explanation of the place of life in the scientific way of the world, including man;
Conscious mastery of concepts and theories of the positions of the main ideas of biology by the interconnection of ideas and data in the formation and development of theories and concepts;
Necessary knowledge of the practical application of knowledge of living systems;
Developing skills to understand the main activities that the cultural sectors need to link to biology; Training Biology Professionals for Informed Choice
The high probability of developing theoretical thinking, as defined by the goal of teaching biology and pedagogical psychology, suggests that you can get the idea of ​ ​ learning with development based on the content of a new education
One of the main positions of this idea is to increase the theoretical level of knowledge.
Due to the fact that the main stage of this school should have a completed nature of general biological education, X-X was previously used! biological fundamental theories and concepts studied in the categories cellular chromosomontogenesis evolation is carried out by transferring environmental information to this stage
Here, of course, the possibility of learning students is taken into account, first of all, in materials studied at the empirical level by former plants of the VI-IX grades, the reduction of the small - ungulate cognitive worldview from the upper to the insignificant is systematized, with the simplification of theory and concept, revealing general biological patterns, chemical foundations of seed formation, metabolism and energy at the cellular level
simplifies integration with these materials
This will allow building the biology studied at school as a model of the corresponding science, in the form of a single course in terms of the principles of systemic policing and to include in its content knowledge of three levels of activity, defining the unity of life in the scientific way of the world by common biological laws, most necessary for the conscious interpretation of the essence of biological trends and phenomena, earlier familiarization of students with the basic stage of school and their general knowledge.
The role of methodological approaches here is that the content of knowledge not only helps to determine the methods of teaching its composition, but also that they, being an integral part of their content, combine biological knowledge with a worldview system.
The goal of the requirement "formation of a scientific approach of schoolchildren to wildlife" will be realized only through content that will not remain in the word
This corresponds to the desire and interests of the student in the direction of determining the aesthetic taste of self-identification positions in the search for the essence of life based on what has a significant impact on the formation of a value-oriented action that takes the leading place in the student of the middle period (11-16) [2 3]
Then the idea of ​ ​ learning with development in the new methodology of biology at school is that the harmonious attitude to the unity of wildlife, together with the logic of the student's personality development and the logic of the educational subject, is determined by the ideas of humanization, which determines the place of biological education in the general culture, the composition of the structure of the content of biological education is based on its teaching methods.
In accordance with the principles of the idea of ​ ​ developmental education, which are the basis for the goals of education and the content of education, the following composition of the content of education is determined:
knowledge of wildlife
This includes a system of modern biological scientific knowledge that reflects the scientific picture of wildlife, and various mythical religious creatures that are an integral part of the culture/model/wildlife, which complements it with a socio-cultural background.
The scientific image of wildlife: a/about the main types of biological phenomena/biosphere concepts of human life of a plant animal; structure/main characteristics/relationships of biological processes and vital activities/properties of living objects located in them; b/biological patterns of t
includes knowledge
knowledge of the activities that students should own
Scientific and research artistic
actions designed to solve educational tasks of a constructive and technological practical nature, and types of actions aimed at solving educational tasks of a moral nature designed to understand the attitude to wildlife/the value of life activity/conscious assessment of a place in a wildlife culture;
knowledge of methods and ways of learning
About this knowledge/empirical theoretical practice: about the ability/ability and methods of its assimilation/logical: generalization of analysis synthesis; experimental simulation of the test experience
/ education
Taking into account the peculiarities of cognition related to the age of students in the main school, studied in psychology for the purpose of education, and based on a didactic position, which suggests that all students should be given an equal opportunity to receive education, and that the composition of the biological education system should be determined on the basis of the level of education from biology in schools in advanced countries, first of all, the basic/invariant/level of educational material provided by the school to each student, that is, the basic content of education.
Summing up, we are currently dealing with the aforementioned candidate of pedagogical sciences Professor K.
In the subject "Biology" founded by Zhunusovna, we studied until the 2013 school year with biology programs and a teaching and methodological complex developed in accordance with the standard of the general mandatory standard of education
And in accordance with the current changes in the educational paradigm, the structure of biology changes in accordance with the concept of 12 years of education

Module of new technology of interactive education pedagogy
Modular learning technology in the late 60s of the XX century
in the pedagogy of developed capitalist states began to spread rapidly
During these years, the search for improving the quality of training began due to the emergence of effective technical means of training
The interest of many researchers in the modular way of learning made it necessary to achieve various goals
A group of scientists dealing with this issue tried to give the student the opportunity to do convenient intensive work, to choose the appropriate way of learning [1]
Founder of the idea of ​ ​ modular education in pedagogy, professor at the University of Padua USA S.
Small amount of educational material during its training
as an independent topic, they were called "microcourse"
Their content and scope are determined by didactic goals
Module	-	to read	contents	I	technologies	having united	standing	purposeful	functional binder
This is an individual part of the training course, consisting of the following components:
the target programme;
a set of information;
methodical management;
practical tasks;
control operation [2]
Features of modular training: modular training is a special type of professional activity
To master training technology, it is necessary to use pedagogical experience
This is a work that requires people with certain business qualities of personality, creatively related to their activities
Of course, each teacher himself will be formed when mastering new technologies
The reading module consists of three structural parts: introductory and final sections
In the introductory part, the teacher:
introduces the general composition of the training unit
defines the goals and objectives of cognitive activity in the training module
explains the training material on the whole topic of the module based on the reference diagrams
The following rules must be observed in the Conversation section:
Training Material Unification Rules
The principle of learning in the direction of "growth"
"Transplant" rule
In the negotiation department, students develop their own knowledge using active forms of education
Good knowledge of learning material allows the simple and complex to move from a simple job to a search [3]
This gives rise to the main features of training technology:
Learning of the content of training is presented in the form of separate complexes, carried out in accordance with the set goal
The goal is set for the student and determines not only the volume of content read, but also the level of his/her possession
The student also receives written instructions indicating how to work effectively with the teacher
Changing the form of communication between teacher and students
It will be implemented through modules through the process of personal communication between the manager and the subordinate
The student works a lot of time independently, he learns to self-give in planning goals
The integrity of the educational structure will remain in the formation of the educational activities of students and levels of education
The content of the teaching of discipline in the curricula is consistently stated
Teaching of the subject taking into account the general direction of development of students' activities in teaching and bringing it into line with the nature of actions and content of the subject, if necessary, its adjustment is allowed
Modular training system is very efficient
Here all types of work perform feedback in harmony with each other
Another aspect of the effectiveness of this system is that it individually takes into account the need for the interest of schoolchildren
In modular education, both students and teachers are active, the study group
Because only module training opens your eyes to their internal capabilities and promotes two-way active single action
As a result, chemistry will contribute to high-quality development
By creating a modular chemistry training program in the training tool, you can reveal the following important aspects
Clear definition of the purpose of the content of the training;
completeness of the training material;
support guidance;
availability of control materials;
adequacy of technical means;
You can note the clarity of the teaching methodology system [5]
At the present stage, one of the global trends in the development of chemical education in order to achieve a high level of chemical education of students is education using educational technologies
Training in the subject of general chemistry with model technology will solve the following issues:
develop skills in the practical use of knowledge obtained by students in general and professional disciplines;
wide application of informatization of education using new technologies;
develop the mental abilities of students using educational material in accordance with their level of education;
modular	technologies	theoretical	of the Republic of Kazakhstan	through	future	experts	creates opportunities for conscious learning of concepts necessary for production activities
In order to teach the subject of general chemistry using modular technology, the following requirements are imposed on the teacher:
knowledge of the basic principles of organization of educational and methodological work when implementing the use of modular technologies in the educational process;
Understanding the role of the use of modular technologies in the education system and vision for their development;
Knowledge of the informative features of the operation of modular technologies in the educational process;
knowledge of psychological and pedagogical basis of implementation of modular technologies in the process of training [6]
Structure of the module - methodological instructions for achieving the didactic goal of the target action plan information fund
Depending on this technology, the training content is transferred in the form of an information group (block), brought to the known compact composition
This information is studied in accordance with didactic goals, reflecting not only the content of the training, but also the methods and the level of their mastery
Modular learning can be used in connection with the traditional learning system
Modules can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of the educational system by finding a place in the desired form of organization
The technology of concentrated (concentrated) training is based on the bathing method for a subject long known in pedagogy
Opinion of proponents of this technology: in the traditional class-lesson system of training, the content of training transmitted in accordance with programs and textbooks will be presented on a conditionally independent scale, sorted into the headings of paragraphs
Using modular learning technology, you can achieve the following achievements:
Saving time
Improves the quality of classes
Allows you to select methods and readers
Training of trainees	increases activity and interest, therefore, higher reading performance
The specifics of education and education with the introduction of modular learning technology are as follows:
Transfer of training materials according to the reference drawing diagram with bringing to the specified system
Duplication of knowledge gained on the new topic
Passion for Knowledge and Teamwork Training
Deepening knowledge already learned
Accurate definition of knowledge level
Using the interactive board in modular learning is very effective
Because the necessary drawings allow you to use electronic textbooks if necessary laboratory practices
In general, the core of modular training is a training module
The training model consists of a completed block of information, instructor's instructions and a targeted student action program for the successful implementation of the program
The only technology that forms the skills and skills of modular learning technology necessary to increase the creative abilities of the individual to self-development [7]

To date, the credit system is widely involved in the educational process of Kazakhstan
The purpose of the credit training system implementation is to train specialists corresponding to the new society
improving the level of professional training of students, comprehensive development of their individual creative abilities
If earlier in universities there were educational programs showing that each student should "read," now the credit system requires students to independently search and study [1-3]
In recent years, due to the widespread dissemination of information technologies that meet modern requirements, teaching methods and approaches have undergone significant changes and new methods have been used.
Traditional
"education" limits its purpose and meaning to learning a clearly defined set of knowledge
Conduct of traditional classes:
The teacher speaks actively most of the time;
students quietly listen to the teacher;
priority type of training - clarification;
The main part of the classes is individual assessment;
classes take place in a long time
An innovative approach understands that learning should be based not only on subjects, but also on interactive methods based on thinking and reflection
Interactive methods lead to a change in pedagogical approaches and lead to the self-realization and self-development of students, understanding and evaluating their own capabilities and embedded values
Conduct interactive sessions:
orienteering teacher;
students discuss activation;
the student himself is looking for an answer to the question;
New valuation types are used;
work with food and group;
a lot of informative material will be contained as soon as possible
During the development of technology at the present stage, the teacher managed to radically change the role of teachers not only the knowledge carrier, but also the students themselves	creativity	works	head
Everyone	teacher	in front	application of teaching techniques that develop creative abilities that activate students
This is why interactive techniques should form the basis of the educational process
The word "interactive" from English means "inter" - "act" among themselves
Thus, "interbelency" means joint interaction in building dialogue
Interactive learning method - a way of learning, based on a dialogue form of interaction between participants in the educational process
During which the trainees jointly
action skills are generated [4]
Interactive and active methods have a lot in common
The peculiarity of interactive methods from active methods lies in the active interaction of the student in the learning process not only with the teacher, but also among students (Figure 1)
a)	Teacher
Figure 1
Active and interactive learning methods
The importance of interactive learning in the organization of the knowledge learning process:
allows students to actively study;
allows each student to jointly discuss their knowledge and ideas about education;
deep thinking develops individual reflexive abilities;
analysing and evaluating their ideas and actions;
takes part in discussions, proves his thoughts and opinions
Interactive learning addresses the following challenges:
develops communication skills and skills;
helps to establish emotional connections between students;
Develop general learning knowledge and skills (synthesis of goal analysis);
teaches to work in a team to listen to someone else's opinion
Interactive methods: the method of role-playing games and blitz questions for presentations on working with the group - quizzes using the method of attacking the brain of stages of mini-research business games method inserts method questionnaires and t
Consider some interactive methods widely used in the development of natural disciplines:
Design Method:
Solution of issues of design method importance (practical scientific creative life) is necessary if necessary in research research
A graduate must be able to combine professional skills and knowledge with life in order to adapt to current dynamic times
This is evidenced by the practical significance of the same design method
Sometimes the experience gained by the student in practice is found in solving problems that arise at work in everyday life
When studying a chemical subject, students can be presented with the following design topics:
"Chemistry in everyday life" "Food supplements and human health" "Cosmetic products" "Medicines" "Chemistry of household detergents" and t
If we talk about the approach to the discussion of the project issue, then the preparation for it will begin first
That is, the opinion requires preliminary and thorough preparation of the group for each student participating in the competition
In order to ensure that the classes are productive and interesting, the teacher prepares the participants for the seminar in advance
During the discussion, students-opponents will have to fully prepare on thematic issues to solve prepared issues
In "Design" technology widely use information technology, search and collect information from all sides
In "Design" technology widely use information technology, search and collect information from all sides
Visually explain themselves
Responsibility will develop
Case method:
Case - technology - is based on the collection of text audio-visual multimedia teaching materials when organizing traditional and remote consultations of teachers and sending them for self-study by users
Case - technology (English case - potrfel) is implemented by methodological materials developed from training
Case - Technology:
S	system examination (analysis);
S	problematic methods;
S	experiments;
S	discussion (discussion)
Role	Games:
Role-playing games develop the outlook of students, activate classes and increase interest in the subject
During the game, the student enters the game without any interference and is active, showing leadership (leadership)
That is, the game is one of the tools to increase the level of listening, capable of correctly speaking competently
The most important sides of role-playing games:
Communicates with;
V positive emotional instrument
Role-playing games are based on solving a number of problematic issues for more detailed familiarization with the specifics of the future profession of students
Will contribute to the development of a culture of role-playing
He develops the ability of the future specialist to self-service at the level of application of terms related to the profession
The purpose of the lesson is the development of logical thinking and enrichment of dictionary funds to deepen knowledge to increase the creative interest of students
The effectiveness of role-playing games is that students nurture their will to win in working with the group
Pre-roles are highlighted and a scenario is being developed
Game participants who play roles collect the necessary materials for the game
Discussion (discussion):
There are several types of discussions: structural or regulatory opinion - discussion modeling, characterized by elements - competition is divided into discussion of the project problem
If the topic of the lecture takes place in the form of a more pronounced problematic discussion, it will be highly effective if the student independently looks for a ready-made answer to the questions posed
In the method "Discussions" will form their own opinions of students
Uses in life, tries to be sure of words
Competing can spark heated discussion and prove your thoughts
The culture of speech will be formed and trained in the game
Language Foundation quickly remembers complementary subject terms
Method of "attacking the brain":
Method of attacking the brain in 1941
Osborne proposed
Initially, this method, used in the advertising business, aimed to promote the creative thinking of a person
The main tasks of this method are:
V	accumulating as many ideas as possible;
V	addressing issues related to science or study; V	development of creative thinking of students; V	development of cooperation
Attack on the brain - active work of members of the group on a specific topic
an attempt to justify the ideas expressed against him, including discussing and imagining that they had reached a general agreement
This action must be carried out by the driver in an actual amount of time
Method of "attacking the brain" -	the formation of friendly relations caused by the activity of the participants, the key to achieving a high result and the gold rule
The "Attack on the Brain" method resembles the themes of the subject
Memory abilities are developing [6]
Thus, the main purpose of the application of interactive teaching methods in the lessons is to identify the level of mastery of the studied issues in students and the ability to seek their opinion on the analysis of complex topical issues to date [7]
The main principles of interactive training are:
medium formation
teach by action
associate with life
inclusion in independence
In conclusion, the teacher is confident that the new way of learning is to use technology and information in searching for various basic data if he conducts interactive methods, linking them in his practice

Prospects for the development of tourism destinations in France
One of the leading and most dynamic sectors of the world economy is tourism
This future remains an important sector in the dynamic development of the economy
The article provides for the tourism potential of Western European countries
In Western Europe, there are many factors that attract tourists
Analysis of tourism resources of France was carried out, including the features of the geographical location of the country
For Kazakhstan, the model of inbound tourism plays an important role in the development of tourism in the future
French tourism model of the world tourism organization, including the natural and recreational resources of the international tourist area
Cluster Marketing Master Plan Tourism Infrastructure Expertise
Head of State N.
In the Address to the People of Kazakhstan last year, Nazarbayev emphasized the need to develop tourism as one of the priority areas of the country's economy
In this regard, on the initiative of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the project "Proposal for the assessment and development of competitive and potentially promising sectors of the economy of Kazakhstan, serviced by the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning and the American consulting company" Center for Marketing Expert Research "was implemented.
Project aims to increase competitiveness of promising sectors of Kazakhstan's economy
According to experts, Kazakhstan's competitive advantage in its amazing culture (cultural and cognitive) distinguishes rich natural potential (environmental tourism) from the fact that due to the growth of activity, it is possible to engage in official tourism, as well as active recreation activities, such as sports and other types of tourism
Results of Kazakhstan cluster development summed up at the conference "Competitiveness and cluster development of Kazakhstan" in Astana in January 2013
Of the 150 sectors of the economy, the most ready and able to pay off quickly
Selected 7 areas: tourism metallurgy building materials oil and gas engineering logistics services textile and food industry
Based on them, the first clusters have been created and continue to be created, which can produce significant results in the next 5-7 years [1]
Zhambyl region - one of the beautiful regions with a deep history of flora and fauna
Nevertheless, tourism is developing slowly
This is due to the insufficient economy of tourist firms in the direction of increasing the level of training in the field of tourism, the weak level of service of the imperfection of tourism and transport infrastructure
Master Plan for Development of Tourism Cluster of the Region up to 2014 approved
According to this plan, last year archaeological excavations began on the site of structures built in the X-XII centuries
The Western Europe-Western China International Highway is important for the creation of a tourist cluster
The creation of cluster tourism in the republic, including in the Zhambyl region, will contribute to solving the following important tasks:
attracting foreign and domestic investment in the tourism industry;
Establishing a high level of public and private management to ensure clear coordination between the central and regional levels of government;
promoting personal enthusiasm;
creation of industry information space;
creation of an effective system of providing Kazakhstan tourist products in the foreign and domestic markets;
Adoption of necessary investment and tax regulations and regulations
Creation of favorable conditions for the development of inbound tourism and the creation and development of a tourism cluster in Kazakhstan, aimed at using the potential of the republic, will contribute to increasing the competitiveness of the national economy
The creation and development of a tourism cluster in the Zhambyl region provides for the solution of the following common problems:
reducing the impact of administrative barriers;
training of qualified professionals to work in the tourism area;
conducting marketing research;
ensuring the safety of tourists;
Investing in Tourism
Zhambyl region has competitive advantages:
very rare historical and architectural monuments, including those located on the Great Silk Road for the development of cultural and cognitive tourism;
rich natural resources for the development of environmental tourism;
business activity of the region is important for the development of business tourism
Zhambyl region needs new perspectives and new tools
Familiar approaches to macroeconomic stability do not solve issues of increasing competitiveness
The way to increase competitiveness is to find ways to jointly solve development issues and create structures aimed at developing cooperation
Therefore, the region has a unique opportunity to take its place in the world tourist market
Currently, in the tourist complex of the region in the form of tour operator travel services, where tourism products are provided, as well as rest and travel services are perceived as outbound tourism
Currently, the creation and development of a tourism cluster in the region should focus primarily on the sectors of the external and domestic tourism market, since they make up most of the income within Kazakhstan than outbound tourism
To organize the cluster, it is recommended to use the exit entry and the internal type of tourism by classification of different types (table-1) [2]
Classification of tourist tours in the region
Museums of Taraz city
Let's take a look at the summary of the separately presented tours, which determine the basis of the activity of the tourist cluster
Religious species: "Tekturmas architectural complex - Karakhan mazar - Aisha-bibi mazar"
Architectural complex Tekturmas dates from 10-14 centuries
It is located on the right bank of the Talas River in the area of ​ ​ the southeastern part of the city on the very site of the Tekturmas stone chain ("Mazasyn place")
This is one of the oldest cultural attractions
Failed to save the first erected structures of the mausoleum
In 1935, they were completely adjusted, and later the site was cordoned off and a memorial plate was put up (1986) [3]
The location of the Tekturmas complex on the site of the ancient Zoroastrian moth, dating from 7-11, suggests that its formation began before the arrival of Islam in this region, that is, until the 11th century
The construction of the Tekturmas mazar was carried out during Islam
Study of architectural forms allows researchers to claim that it was built in the 14th century
Many rumors about many ancient monuments
But it is still unknown who is buried there
It is believed that one of the dynasties of the rulers of Karakhanaids is buried
Having abandoned the throne, he devoted himself to serving the Allas, was engaged in the dissemination of a new religion - Islam among the Turkic-speaking peoples proclaimed by the state religion
People believed and respected him, in the XIII century a mazar was installed over the grave
It became a place of mass pilgrimage of Muslims, where there were never people
The people called her "Tekturmas"
Tekturmas is not the name of a particular person
In the spring of 1864, a mazar was defeated by the Russian regiment of Colonel Chernyaev during the siege of the Kokand fortress "Holy Father"
The monument was completely destroyed in the late 1920s
Famous entrepreneur A
At the expense of the Tekturmas public fund created on the initiative of Momyshev in 2002, a new mazar was built on the same site
Karakhan mazar is part of a cultural and memorial complex located in the city center and established on the territory of former medieval cemeteries
The cemetery is located west of the former military fortress on the left bank of the Tuite Canal
Now the complex is part of the zone of the State Historical and Cultural Reserve "Monuments of Ancient Taraz"
According to legend, Mazar was elevated to the rank of saint (Aulie-ata) Karakhan
In the 12th century, a mazar erected by Said Bekhanov was rebuilt in Tashkent
It is a portal-domed building - an example of Central Asian cultural architecture of the late Middle Ages
Above the entrance to the portal there is an epigraphic coil with the date of construction and the customer's initials
In the center of the hall is a large brick castle
13 g in this cemetery
He was one of the largest commanders of that time with the mazar Shamansur (davudbek)
Mazar Aisha-bibi is located on the outskirts of the village of Aishabibi
Mazar Aisha bibi and nearby mazar Babazh khatun are part of the memorial and cultural complex
The site of the complex is free from open buildings on all sides, trees are planted around
Historical information about mazar and the identity of Aisha-bibi has not been found, but there are many legends on this topic
According to the legend of Aisha-bibi - a young girl - lived 11-12 g
Aisha-bibi met Karahan and loved him
But Karahan was forced to return home, having received a message about an enemy attack
Aisha-bibi, who did not receive notification from him on time, asks his father for permission to travel to his homeland Karahan
If he is alive, he blesses his father to return with him
But the girl's father does not allow her to pass by three times
Then Aisha with 40 daughters will go to Karahan
On the way, the girls stop resting on the shore
At this moment, the snake, hiding from the girl, takes off the girl
Hearing from the girls, Karakhan hurries to him
But does not have time
Aisha dies with him
in memory of his lover, Karakhan erects a mazar on her grave
The people rank Aisha among the saints and value her [3]
Religious species: "Complex mazar Akyrtas-Sipatai batyr"
The Akyrtas complex is located 40 km east of the city of Taraz at a dozen Aksholak stations 6 km at the foot of Kyrgyz Alatau
Objects of palace buildings located on both sides of the drying river rod in the complex
These are country premises, castle park quarry stone quarry (reservoir)
The study of the history of Akyrtas lasted 130 years
A number of scientists believe that this is the summer residence of the local leader, while others consider the caravansaray point
But in any case, construction surprises with its scale and grandeur the presence of water supply gardens
Mausoleum Sipatai batyr area 19 ha 20 ha
located on the banks of the modern Almaty-Taraz-Bishkek highway of the old communications avenue

Recognizable View: The Great Silk Road
The Great Silk Road has become a unique historical monument of human civilization connecting the West and the East
He served from the 11th century BC
The great silk road began the territory of the Zhualynsky district along the modern highway Tashkent-Almaty
It will continue through the Burno-Oktyabrsky city of Burny Taraz, the village of Kulan Merki and other departments of settlements [5]
Weapons of mulberry gems along the silk road
brought
He is a distributor of various religions of religious culture and art
Along the Silk Road there are many historical and cultural monuments
Only with scientists-specialists and researchers of the local region, from among the ancient nomads of the Stone Age
more than two thousand objects of architectural monuments of medieval mazar cities and historical and revolutionary monuments of Turkic stone sculptures of ancient settlements were identified and taken into account
Of course, tourism activity, as a branch of the economy, is not yet sufficiently developed in the Zhambyl region
Entering the region has a low share of tourism, as there are few specialists who know the history of their region with low quality of services provided with underdeveloped tourism infrastructure
On a modern scale, the tourist activity of the region is represented mainly by shop tours and religious tours of holy places
Tours to promote the life of Kazakhs are practically absent [6]
The successful development of the tourism cluster in the region primarily requires state support from the authorities
Thus, in order to achieve the goals set, it is necessary to solve the following tasks:
Strengthening public policy in the tourism area;
improvement of the system of regulation of tourism activities;
Comprehensive development of the legal institutional and economic foundations of the tourism industry;
protection of the tourism market through tax incentives, state guarantees and other measures of support from the state;
ensuring the safety of tourists;
formation of Kazakhstan's image as an additional tourist market;
improving the information management system;
deepening research in the tourism area;
Bringing the statistical accounting of tourism services in line with international standards;
- Stimulating the development of tourism infrastructure by attracting domestic and foreign investment for the reconstruction and construction of tourism facilities;
Improving the quality of tourist services through standardization and licensing of tourism activities;
development of the system of training and advanced training of specialists in the tourism zone
To date, 2 investment business projects in the tourism industry have been prepared
The presented projects were sent to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan for adoption as relevant investment projects in the field of tourism, The project was approved and submitted for further implementation
Project implementation period from 2015 to 2020 [7]
The formation and development of the tourism cluster in Zhambyl region is currently among the current issues
This is evidenced by the results of a marketing and expert study of the prospects for the development of the tourism industry in the Zhambyl region based on the development of the cluster
According to the results of this study, it is planned to develop the direction of tourism development in the Zhambyl region (Master Plan), which identifies areas with a tourist perspective, routes and places for tourist facilities
Obviously, funds are needed to implement this activity
The main goal of the Program is to create a highly efficient competitive tourist complex with modern requirements and turn it into a highly profitable department of the economy
In accordance with the goal, one of the main issues of the Program is the development of a direction of tourism development based on a cluster in Zhambyl region based on the results of a marketing and expert study of the tourist opportunities of the territory
This will create favorable conditions for lending to the entities of this industry to attract investments in the regional tourism sector to promote tourism products to the republican and world tourist services markets in the activation of new tourist facilities in the development of a set of measures that affect the development of tourism infrastructure and the modernization of the material and technical base of tourism in the territory
In 2013, there was a low growth in the tourism industry by type of tourism services under the influence of the global financial crisis, although the number of tourist facilities remained unchanged
Stop temporary warehouses 8-1 from 28 accredited tourist organizations
About 4520 for 161 million.
Services in the amount of tenge were provided, compared to 2012, the number of visitors decreased by 25 times, the volume of services provided decreased by 42 times [8]
In 2015, it marks 550 years when Kerey and Zhanibek were located in the zone between the Shu and Talas rivers.
In this regard, in the country happened
consideration of inclusion in the number of anniversary days and holding events dedicated to the celebration of the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate

Register of Natural Landscape Tourism Cluster Routes of the State National Tourism Park
Tourism is one of the busiest industries in the country in recent years
This industry is becoming the most profitable industry in our economy
However, the number of tourists traveling outside the country prevails over vacationers inside the country
They explain this by the fact that the hotel in our country is not inferior in price to tourist services
You can also hear that the domestic type of tourist services is below the European standard
According to representatives of the travel company, the following factors occurred [1c
The activities of the World Tourism Association of Kazakhstan do not promote and create projects to form the image of the country
Pay increases for tourism workers
Difficulties of obtaining permits for tourist visas from embassies of Kazakhstan
Underdevelopment of transport and roads transported to places of residence
Lack of 3-4 star cheap hotels [2 s
After long discussions, the goal was set to use economic tourism in Pavlodar region and natural landscapes of the region while preserving the natural state without damage
As for the current solution of the problems, this region is recognized as effective for the implementation of the tourism cluster
Because hotels, sanatorium, entertainment center, nature reserves and other facilities are concentrated here
It is also planned to mobilize individual entrepreneurs to increase the interest of foreign tourists in this region
Cultural and educational tourism for historical purposes established in Pavlodar region
Today, in many countries of the world, tourism as a priority development area is the main financial source of the economy
Therefore, our compatriots go on vacation a year to vacation places on the Black Sea coast and in Issyk-Kul, resting in the open air, swimming in clear water.
Let's see if we have an opportunity for the development of tourism, including in the Bayanaul district of Pavlodar region [3 from 115];
Bayanaul district - a place where unrealistic tourism opens its breath
32 recreation areas have been created around the lakes Zhasybay Sabyndykol Toraigyr on the territory of Bayanaul State National Natural Park
Five of them belong to industrial facilities
The creation of tourist routes on the territory of the Bayanaul State National Natural Park will allow developing ideology and promising directions of a healthy lifestyle, conducting work in a cultural and cognitive ecological direction
Trainings and scientific (botanical ornithological) trainings for tourists on environmental tourism
etymological) tourism
Of the 11 tourist routes for 696 km, 6 operate today
Of these, 116 km on horseback and 460 km of vehicles and 120 km at pedestrian crossings
The roads of these routes are equipped with stairs and toilets in places of rest
It is planned to open 4 more routes along the route "Dalba" and "Kyzyltau"
From year to year, the tourism sector develops in accordance with the plan
On the territory of the park there is a 28 holiday home, accommodating more than 40 thousand people
There are also 2 holiday homes for children
Excursions organized by tourist companies of Pavlodar city are conducted by park employees
150 thousand people visit the Zhasybay recreation area per year [4 from 44];
List of tourist routes
In Zhasybay recreation area for twenty years will pass interregional meeting of tourists "Irtysh meridian"
Its organizers were the regional newspaper "Star of the Irtysh" and the regional department for youth tourism and sports of Pavlodarturist JSC
Purpose of the meeting: strengthening of friendly relations between tourists of Russia and Kazakhstan, further development of sports tourism, promotion of environmental management and exchange of sports experience
The Slet program consists of a cross-trip tourist relay and a program in which the tourist song contest is necessarily included [5 s238];
Booklets on tourism and investment opportunities of the region, as well as postcards with images of nature objects and sights and other advertising and information products are advertised in the markets of domestic and social tourism services
Currently, a special tourist map is being published in the region and promising conditions are being created
In tourism, the inclusion of children and adolescents in healthy lifestyles is of particular importance
This is evidenced by annual tours of the native land among children and adolescents, as well as the holding of an open regional championship on the development of active tourism among children and youth

Geography of monogorodny monogorodny monotowns social infrastructure
Cities - the most important part of the entire territorial system of society is the basis of the national economy of the country
In human history, cities have a special place and significance
This is due to the following circumstances:
Firstly, the city will always be associated with a change in production forces
The craft industry is then, due to its speed and novelty, more useful than rural conservatism, which provides the city, including using labor;
Secondly, the territory of cities has become a trading space in which, with the accumulation of funds in them, goods and services are purchased that lead to the movement of their institutions (banks - insurance companies of exchanges);
Thirdly, cities for centuries have played the role of management centers in economic political and ideological relations
There were no such objective and subjective conditions of rural life;
Fourth, the city concentrates the population on its territory with creative thoughts that determine the development of science and technology of education and art [1 18 b
The idea of ​ ​ the "city" in different periods of life received several meaningful reviews
This concept is presented on the basis of historical and genetic formal-legal economic - statistical demographic socio-economic and other features
Currently, the role and influence of the city is at the stage of dynamic development of the economy.
In accordance with this, the formation of "mono" "small" "monobean" "monobrand" concepts is placed in an important place, requiring multi-directional work on the development and improvement of the city's economy [2 17
The geography of cities, including single-industry towns, is of great importance
Because the predominance of industrial potential in single-industry towns, the presence of favorable conditions for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, the presence of free territories for the placement of new production capacities
conditions not only have a positive impact on the development of the country's economy in increasing competitiveness, but are also crucial in solving issues of the socio-economic situation of urban settlements
A city with a monoprofile single-city economy of the monoprofile word "monocal"
synonym for these words
But we cannot consider the concepts of a single-city and a small city as an unambiguous concept
Cities with one-way specialized economic base
These cities are characterized by a close connection with a large city-forming enterprise, which usually affects the functioning of the urban settlement and all important aspects of the life of the city.
A single-industry town is a city dependent on the same production as Arkalyk, and cities with a small number of people without large urban planning production are classified as a small city [3 322 b
The distribution of single-industry towns in foreign and Russian literature by many researchers in a broad sense
with descriptions
Russian scientist I.
Lipsits (single-industry towns and city-forming enterprises and methodological problems of single-industry towns of the Russian Federation) explained by a "single-industry town" the leading activities of city-forming enterprises in the conditions of municipal management
Lappo calls the city a monobean city, where local enterprises in the territory with any functioning function based on the city work closely with agriculture
Petrikova considers the terms "monocity" and "city-plant" as a close concept to each other
Let us dwell on the consideration of the term single-industry town in foreign literature
In Canadian practice, the term "single industry town" is often used.
The term single-industry town is associated with the presence of natural resources there with the main source of raw materials
For example, the single town of Smeltertown, based on the mining industry in America Elliot Lake in northern Ontario, may be noted.
In Western practice, the term single-industry is used in relation to the main areas of specialization of the city
The term "Mining town" is widely used - a city specializing in mineral reserves
Leadbeater used this term to study Sandon Ferny Osina Tellur Grant Sudbury Timmin's Kanda mine single-industry towns
In the use of the term single-industry towns, "Coalt own" is the main branch of specialization - the coal industry
"Fishing town" - gold-mining town - the main source of raw materials is the Lumber town gold field - forestry is classified as "textile town" - a city in the textile industry and uses the term single-industry in connection with the main specialized industry of the city [4 254 b
The issue of single-industry towns in our country is one of the current
In order to achieve sustainable socio-economic development of single-industry towns in the medium and long term, the Single-Industry Towns Development Programme 2012-2020 was adopted on 25 May 2012.
"single-industry" called the city, which employs more than 20 percent of the employed population employed in city-forming enterprises of the city with a population of 10 thousand to 200 thousand people, the concentrated majority of the able-bodied population and industrial production (more than 20%) in enterprises that determine the economic and social situation of the city of one or more (no more than) city-forming single-industry and raw materials under this program
The methodology for determining Russian and foreign single-industry towns is to provide employment for city-forming enterprises in the city and the indigenous population, where the main source of raw materials is specialization, where the factors of connection of single-industry towns with other settlements of the same territory were used to give a single-industry character to our country [5 32
The main goal of the single-industry development program is to intensify economic activity in the regions, that is, to create conditions for visiting the regions not only by a large producer, but also by manufacturing small and medium-sized businesses
Within the framework of the Program, the main tasks for solving problems of single-industry towns are identified and it is proposed to consider ways to solve them (Fig. 1)
Main tasks
Mono-Cities Installation
Social and Engineering
development of pnfr amkuryls
Diversification of the economy
Development of small and secondary education
Increasing labour mobility
Figure 1 - Main tasks in the development of single-industry towns
The program included 27 single-industry towns with a population of 153 million people or 168 percent of the city's population
Analyzing the economic bases of the sectoral structures of cities and taking into account the functions of the main city-forming enterprises, he considered the breakdown of single-industry towns by functional types (Figure 2)
In solving the problem of single-industry towns, it is impossible to work with a common program, since the natural conditions characteristic of each single-industry town vary greatly from the point of view of the development of socio-economic trends in the raw material base
But in all single-industry towns, first of all, general economic issues are being established (wear and tear of deposits of extractive enterprises, uncompetitive product, shutdown or threat of work of the main city-forming enterprises) social issues (unemployment and high level of self-employment) of vital infrastructure (wear and tear of engineering and social infrastructure) in many single-industry towns
All these issues should be resolved through the development of single-industry towns in each region according to their own characteristics [6 25 b
In single-industry towns, the relocation of the population to large cities occurs due to the lack of permanent jobs, in connection with which the social situation is developing
Even in cities with permanent enterprises, there is a tendency to relocate the population in the other direction
Figure 2 - Classification of single-industry towns according to the function of the working performer
"Anchor" investment projects are being implemented in the country to diversify the economy of small cities in solving the problems of single-industry cities
A lot of work is being done to create conditions for the development of monotowns of medium potential and the further sustainable development of monotowns with low potential to solve priority acute problems of monotowns
In addition, on the industrialization map in each small city it is planned to implement at least one project [7 10 b]
In conclusion, the development of single-industry towns in Kazakhstan will solve not only socio-economic issues in the regions, but also, most importantly, solve the issues of deploying production forces
Improving the efficiency of the economy in single-industry towns can have a great impact on the socio-economic development of the country, solving issues of maintaining social balance and ensuring environmental stability

Words: nomadic culture, national-economic migration nature қү_bylystary light fixtures of the accounting sky.
Understanding natural phenomena with year-round observation of the rotation of days and night years and seasons and the use of its legitimacy for the life of the nomadic population was of great importance for its economic life
It was on this basis that they marked the time of migration in four seasons by means of this report or calendar, when slaughter cattle breeding and even the time of birth of the family.
The history of the formation of such astronomical knowledge common to the entire nomadic population engaged in additional agriculture and hunting, having founded nomadic animal husbandry, from early morning
started and life support in the farm reaches today
It was also a pure knowledge of the nomadic people in the sea of ​ ​ science and education
Kyrgyz people are one of the most well-developed and still hopeless people
The Kyrgyz sooner or later mastered astronomical knowledge, enriching their life experience and inheriting it from generation to generation
They observed weather changes in antiquity and estimated natural phenomena over four periods of the year
Thus, four products ensured the well-being of cattle breeding at different times, well-being from natural disasters, an increase in the number of livestock
They used this knowledge in the territory of agricultural hunting and war
"Counter" named those who monitor natural phenomena and monitor its change
Accountants were aware in advance of the impact of their change on the Earth by observing planets in outer space and informed people
Kyrgyz have become a tradition of studying nature thanks to the beauty of the petrified sky and the freedom-loving people within the framework of nature
Special attention was paid to the study of the night starry sky
Thus, he gave the stars a name and appreciated the place
So what:
Urker Toltoy Ush Arkar Zhetygen
Small Zhetygen Altyn kazyk
Double Veal Yellow Star
Sholpan (Venus) Balbyldak Shyshnylu (Merkura) Saban Zhol
Looks like he saw
In international astronomy, the 7-star Kyrgyz "Big Bear" was called "Zhetygen" as "Small Bear," calling it "Temir kazyk" a two-star and three-star "Arkandagan horse" next to the Iron Cauldron "Taraza star and three stars on the back" Sniper gun and dog "[1]
Kirghiz paid great attention to changes to the star of Urker and closer to the moon
He was called Togol (Togal)
Each month has a specific contact date with Urker
These days were unpleasant - snowstorms
Zai's life (Yellow Star) rises up, and spring lengthens.
If you drop, it's better
In the spring, they watched the first thunderstorm and connected it with the onset of the year
Or wish for diversity
For example, during the first thunderstorm, older women beat a bucket with a bucket in their hands and shouted: "The earth spread, having lost the blue wind, a milk dambored stone dam" - three times loudly rotated the house
So he wished Tangir an abundance of milk harvest
This rite from the cult of nature is still preserved among the country.
In spring, the first day on the mountainside will be arid.
If the skirt smells dry and rainy, then the grain will be better than before than at the usual time of year, then spring will lengthen, and autumn will lengthen if it is later
And so, following the changes of such planets and phenomena, he experimented and used them to a certain extent
"If ears (corallans) come out of the sun, it will rain on its feet if snow is heard in an ambush" [2]
Kyrgyz also observe the phenomenon of the habitat of animals and animals in combination with the weather
Karkara (crane), which I wanted to record, thought it would be expensive, and in the fall the goose and nails would return earlier.
Salt deer autumn occurs earlier than usual, next spring
He believed that spring could stretch and become difficult with the animal if he got into the herd late
Also in the fall, when the star of Urker was born, a mountain goat enters the herd
Well, if Urker gets into the circle when he is born lower, then next year will be a comfortable summer
And on the contrary, Urker said that it would be unpleasant if he joined the circle when he rose
Records of the Tang-Patyshalyk era in the history of China and other historical materials say that the Kyrgyz are one of the earliest nationalities among Turkic nationalities in Central Asia.
Kirghiz allocated a year for 12 months 3 months for one summer (spring)
The indigenous (ancient) Kyrgyz allocated one year for 12 months: the first month - the month of the second month - the month of kuryk the third month - the blue fourth month - July the fifth month - the yellow sixth month - September the seventh month - September the eighth month - November the ninth month - October the tenth month - January the eleventh month - February the twelfth month
Another way to name twelve months, comparing the name of the 12 stars of the sky with the time when the first appeared for the first time in a year.
The first month - the second month the second month (bond) the third month - the fourth month - puppy the fifth month - the sixth month - sunbulek the seventh month - marase the eighth month - the ninth month
- tenth month - eleventh month - twelfth month called stars
Other names associated with changing living conditions after this calendar has been used so far
For example, Nauryz is considered the month of the new year
If we consider such a calculation in connection with the existing lunar names of Kazakhstan, we can formulate as follows [3]:
False Qur'an (Big Qur'an or Nauryz) (Nauryz); This Qur'an (April);
Deer (May); Kulja (June); Teke (July);
Home auna (August); Auna Stupa (September);
Month of Nine (Kazan); Seventeenth month (November); Fifth month (December); Third month (January);
Month of Birding (February)
These lunar names and those associated with old saiga names and their vital activities [4]
Kyrgyzstan still uses calendar in age category
Similar in this regard to Kazakhs, taking into account membership
For example:
Mouse (Mouse) House (Cow)
Barys or tiger (barys) Coyon (Koyan)
Old Man or Fish (Ulu) Snake (Snake)
Horse (Horse) Coy (Coy)
Monkey or sword (Meshin) Tuk (Kuryk)
Donguz (donor)
In the Kyrgyz sense, when one person's membership is achieved, it is considered as 13 25 37 49 63 youth of age [5]
(Assigns 12 years to each member)
Saved an interesting phrase about a member
A man who came to age threw one dish at his house on his feet and pulled out a dick
Seven-day weeks (Friday) are called names of Arabic-Persian
In order [6]:
Monday (Monday) Sheishenby (Tuesday) Sharshenby (Wednesday) Beishenby (Thursday) Friday (Friday)
Shenby (Saturday) Jackshenby (Sunday)
Kirghiz allocated time for the day-night on:
Dawn robber - not dawn - dawn - dawn - sun -
the sun began to set at the beginning of the mountain - rising sun - sun - kebab - great checkers - false color - color - color - color - afghan - sarts - Kyrgyz five - forerunner - prayers - sun battery - at sunset (Prayer candle) - a turn (visible) - the end of the country - a prayer service for a long time - drank food smoothly - the country lay - when the country was even - when a smooth - heavy sleep slept - closer to midnight - mid-night - Auganda - closer to morning
Separately from them, time "fill with conom" "bi sum" "meat jam" "boiling water tea"
"half day" is also denoted by quantitative values, as "day-night" [7]

The standard of living of the population is a socio-economic category caused by certain requirements and norms established in social processes that represent criteria for the use of material and spiritual good
It is determined by the aggregate of real socio-economic needs in life
In this regard, the main issues of living standards of the population and its research - society
Despite the level of socio-economic development, countries are the main category for the countries of the world
There is no clear scientific theory about the standard of living in the economic literature
Some authors consider the standard of living as a set of different conditions that determine the life of people
However, its main tasks as an object of economic research "Standard of Living" can be noted as the following:
Assessment of indicators characterizing a person's quality of life (ability to lead a healthy lifestyle - a source of income, sufficient for a decent life and higher vocational education);
Identification of nominal and specific revenues;
housing for long-term consumer goods;
Making interstate comparisons by assessing quality and standard of living in different countries of the world;
Living Standards Research to Shape Industry Policy
Population research is important in determining the standard of living of the population
This is very important for sparsely populated countries such as Kazakhstan
According to the Statistics Agency, as of March 1, 2014, the country's population was 17 million people.
The population density was 6 people per 207 thousand people.
Cities by geographical location - 9 million.
thousands (479), and rural residents - 55%. 7
728 thousand people (45%)
For two months, the population in the country increased by 42 thousand 400 people
Over twelve months, the country's population grew by 253 thousand people, or 15%
There is an increase in the population and at the same time there is a development in the standard of living
Population growth does not indicate a good standard of living
The high standard of living, as we noted, shows the totality of real socio-economic needs of the population
To do this, it will be necessary to conduct studies of socio-economic differentiation
In socio-economic differentiation, income is mainly studied as one factor
Because income differentiation indicates the difference between population and growth in consumption of goods and services
Low or insufficient income in developing countries prevents them from consuming wealth in accordance with established world criteria
For example, Kazakhstan took 138th place in the ranking of average life expectancy of citizens of 199 countries according to the Development Program in 2013
According to the Statistics Agency of Kazakhstan, the age of the child born in 2013 was expected in Kazakhstan - 6484 children aged 7433 years
And according to the World Health Organization, this year the average age of a child born in a high-income country is 76 years, and the life expectancy of a girl is 82 years
That is, Kazakhstani children will live 8 years less than their contemporaries in prosperous states - 11 years

Link between State welfare and demographic situation
experts recognize
There is still a difference between rich and poor countries - people living in high-income countries have more opportunities to live longer than in low-income countries
The duration of human age in high-income countries depends on the success of the fight against non-communicable diseases
However, according to the Ministry of Health, in recent years life expectancy in Kazakhstan has increased by two and a half times
According to statistics, the projected life expectancy of the population of Kazakhstan in 2013 increased to 7045 years (figure 1 table 1) [1 Page 25]
Life expectancy of the population at birth in the regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2013
Source: according to the Statistics Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the author designed himself
As follows from Table 1, the highest life expectancy of the population at birth in Astana (7429 years) in Almaty (7365 years) in Mangistau region (7168 years)
The lowest indicators were recorded in Karaganda (6898 years) Akmola (6829 years) North Kazakhstan region (6808 years)
Since gaining sovereignty, the Republic of Kazakhstan has been developing various programmes aimed at the socio-economic and spiritual development of the population, research and political modernization
An example is the Message of the Head of State to the people of Kazakhstan "Strategy Қazaқstan-2050 - a new political course of the state"
"Our main goal is social security and the well-being of citizens
This is a good guarantee of stability in society
There is a growing demand for updated and effective social policies that can withstand the criticism of our society by time
World experience shows that social policy is impeccable and impeccable
It is like the absence of no society, all citizens of which are satisfied with this social system
Solving issues of social security and well-being of citizens is a difficult and very important task that affects every citizen of Kazakhstan
Therefore, every step must be carefully considered "- [3 p. 17]
One of the programs aimed at improving the well-being of the population in the country - the "Law on Living Wage," which spells out the concept of "poverty limit," is interpreted as the income limit necessary to meet the minimum needs of the population [4 p. 23]
This threshold of "poverty" is a sign of the provision of targeted social assistance to the state and is specified based on the economic capabilities of the state
Positive changes in the country's economy since 1999 have affected the reduction of poverty in the country
Growth States are the main focus on poverty
But despite the positive trends of the economy, the size of the subsistence minimum is developing more slowly than GDP (figure 2) [5 pp. 26-27]
The most correct situation in terms of poverty in 2014 was in Astana, Almaty, Pavlodar region, where the lowest poverty levels by region were: Astana - 05% of Almaty - 22% of Pavlodar region - 27%
Highest poverty rate - 303% registered in South Kazakhstan region
The low income of the population of the republic in some regions is associated with the natural and climatic conditions of their geographical location
Especially in countries engaged in agriculture, there are now minimal productivity and, accordingly, low incomes of the population

GDP for the Republic of Kazakhstan (percentage)

more than half of the regional product
However, local peoples are extremely dissatisfied with the production of high incomes in the oil and gas sector, as a result of which these areas are also among the regions with the highest levels of poverty
The share of the population with incomes below the subsistence minimum decreased by 29%
The share of the population with incomes below the level of the food portfolio decreased by 02% (Table 3)

It should be noted that the level of poverty is considered deep if the average consumption of low-income groups is below the subsistence level
This difference is two thirds of the subsistence minimum in Eastern Europe - 10-15% in Russia - 426% in Ukraine - 325% in Azerbaijan - 518% in Kyrgyzstan - 66%
The distribution of poverty by regions of Kazakhstan varies: 63% of the number of poor in the country in the southern and western regions
The highest level remains in South Kazakhstan region (303% of the total number of poor in the republic)
Then in Almaty region (112%) in Zhambyl region (80%)
In view of the positive trends in the economy, there is a gradual decrease in the poverty level in the country
The dynamics of gross domestic product and economic development in Kazakhstan can be observed by the proportion of the poor, indicating the results of economic development and the state of poverty in the country (the proportion of the poor can be determined by the proportion of the population living below the subsistence level)
The main reasons for the low coverage of certain population groups are:
Low wages for certain categories of workers;
Employment of able-bodied persons (reduction of changes in enterprises and non-demand of lower categories of specialties);
Low level of social benefits
The current Government is adopting programmes to address these gaps
For example, import substitution development of production and support of domestic producers; creation of new jobs; support for agriculture; coverage of pension loans; access to health care and education; Raising the minimum pension and salaries of civil servants
Reducing unemployment with all this
Because this is one way to start poverty
According to the data, the unemployment rate in 2012 was 53%, and in 2014 it decreased by 51%
At the same time, the official number of unemployed in the republic in 2012 amounted to 4731 thousand people, in 2014 - 4610 thousand people (figure-1)
When assessing unemployment skills in the country, it should be noted that the level of officially registered unemployment is calculated by the fact that citizens apply to public employment services (6 p. 19)

"Citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan are guaranteed deprivation of the breadwinner of disability in case of illness by age and social security on other legal grounds - the minimum wage mentioned in article 28 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan," [1 p. 22]
Social reforms contribute to the development of social policies
At the same time, active social policy must be a Catholicist, and not a limiter of economic growth

The beginning from Teriskei Alatau and Kyrgyz Alatau begins from the confluence of the Zhuanaryk and Koshkar rivers and is called Shu
Large of 80 large industries (in Kazakhstan): Koragats of Merka Karabalta Aksu
Teriskei crosses the Alatau and Kyrgyz ridge through the Shu Upper Orthotokoe and Lower Orthotokoe tracts
In the lower reaches, Shu enters the Istykkul basin
It arose due to the confluence of the Koshkar rivers from the right wing of Karakozhyr from the left wing
The river carries two periods: spring (May) and summer (from the end of June to July)
He has many spheres
Karakundyz Irgayty Asa Kuragats are considered the main in the region
The annual flow of the Shu River is about 2 billion m2 [1]
If the Shu River flow in the Sredne-Togai reservoir is ordered, the state of the inter-republican water pipeline is carried out at the Tasotkel junction of the Orta-Togai section (Figure-1)

Tasotkel Dam
Transportation in July-August freezes in December-March
Due to the ordering of the drain, the water mode has changed due to the natural state
The average annual long-term flow in the village of Amangeldy is 77 m3/s
55% of Shu river water is used for irrigation of more than 60 thousand hectares of arable land in the massif (Figure - 2)

Comprehensive analysis of environmental information, which is the basis of the geoecological map of Kazakhstan, made it possible to systematize specific data in connection with the aggravation of the geoecological situation [2]
Causes of negative environmental situation usually anthropogenic rare natural trends (Table-1)
Levels of ecological destruction of geosystems in the Shu river floodplain
The selection of the environmental disorder assessment criterion will allow the further classification of geosystems, that is, to divide natural zones into lower ordinal levels of ecological disorder
The unification of natural zones under environmental conditions creates conditions for the creation of a unified system of measures aimed at the formation of an environmental situation [3]
In accordance with the above principles, the geoecological zoning of the Shu river basin, divided into 2 physical and geographical countries, consists of 3 geoecological provinces (Table-2)
The provincial names list the main natural and anthropogenic factors that determine the environmental situation, including the main directions of the natural zone of the economy and the use of natural resources [4]
Geoecological zoning of the Shu River basin
Depending on the genetic indicators and complexes of the state of nature, each of them is divided into 2 geoecological provinces, characterized by access to the surface of rocky rocks to the Paleozoic and Paleozoic or the shallow Paleozoic folded foundation
Most provinces produce some of them with mineral raw materials
Man-made disruption of most natural landscapes - environmental impacts of mining activities
The ecological status of geoecological provinces in the Shu River floodplain is diverse, which indicates the spatial presence of factors of anthropogenic impact on the environment
Negative environmental conditions lead to deterioration of human health, degradation or destruction of natural resources, reduction of medium and resource-forming properties of geosystems
Environmental disturbances are related both to the quantitative content of pollutants and to the qualitative composition
It depends on the amount and nature of pollution of production polluting the environment in a certain zone
Disruption of environmental stability - the result of changing the dynamic balance between human needs and the capabilities of industrial technology
This creates environmental crises in human-natural systems
Causes and forms of the environmental crisis in the geosystem structure:
inefficient use of irregular natural resources;
high concentration of economic facilities in a limited area and urbanization;
pollution of the biosphere by harmful wastes;
The modern geoecological state is characterized by its significant diversity
Most geo-ecological provinces have a satisfactory level of environmental degradation (472 per cent)
Tense and dangerous levels are characteristic of 261% and 63%, respectively, of the regions of the Republic
Observed in 15% of the emergency area
Environment of favorable level maintained in 189% of Kazakhstan [5]
Ecological status of geoecological provinces is uneven
Against the background of geoecological favorable conditions, foci with a high or, conversely, low localized level of environmental deterioration are everywhere
As a rule, they are associated with the regional production complexes of mining industries of cities
Geoecological enclave is based on consideration of environmental disturbances of natural components and rate of their economic use similar to ecological-economic area by purpose of allocation
Ecological balance of geosystems can be maintained through the systematic implementation of a set of measures for the prevention of environmental protection and environmental restoration
These measures include:
prevention of air pollution;
prevention of contamination of the surface and groundwater;
prevention of water and wind erosion of soils;
carrying out reclamation works on soil and soil lands disturbed during technogenesis;
rehabilitation of small rivers and lakes close to destruction under the influence of technogenesis;
Restoration of grassland disturbed by plant species degradation and overgrazing;
recultivation of saxaul forests with island steppe pine forests;
restoration of radiation safety and recultivation works in the locations of military test sites;
ensuring environmental safety of residents of rural settlements of the city
Unresolved problems of the global environmental situation, contributing to the preservation of the ecological balance of the nature of the Shu River valleys and border zones, include: global water use of the Caspian Sea Island and the natural disasters of Lake Balkhash - radiation safety of former military space test sites t
Addressing these challenges will require major financial investments to implement the environmental projects needed for scientific and practical solutions

Usanovich's generalized theory predicts chemical interactions with acid salt base rupture-fusion reaction genetic series
The State Program for the Development of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020 includes an improvement in the quality of all generations of education
It clearly states that for the dynamic development of the chemical industry there must be highly qualified specialists, and to solve this problem it is necessary to create educational programs and teaching aids, the correctness of the content of education [1]
Therefore, one of the current problems is the development of a method for predicting the effect of any simple and complex chemical compounds and their acid-based properties, based on their chemical formulas.
Acid-based properties of substances in the development of modern chemical science are the main component of chemical science
In history, the development of knowledge about acids and bases based on laws focused on specific acid-based properties has been among the main problems of chemical science considered to date [2 s
Theories of acid-based interaction reveal many early doubtful points among actions widely used in the chemical industry and science [3 s
According to Usanovich's theory, acid is a fraction in which cations (including a proton) can be released or anions (which includes an electron) can be added.
All hydrogen anhydrous acids according to the previous theories are subject to this definition [4 5 b]
Bases - particles capable, on the contrary, of producing anions (electrons) or adding cations (protons)
This theory allows us to consider many processes in chemical science from one system [5 s
The interaction of bases (metals) and acids (non-metals) consisting of atoms of the same elementary element depends on the configuration of the electron clouds of their outer layer, i.e., on the location in the periodic table.
Bases of all simple substances are divided into s p d f elements and, due to oxidative and oxidative ability, changes known by periods and groups of laws, are characterized by their main chemical properties through validity and acidity [6 98 b]
The main goal of this work is to preliminary predict the chemical properties of inorganic simple and complex compounds based on their chemical formulas based on the Usanovich theory
To achieve this goal, primarily for interaction in a molecule of compounds
determination of acidic and reasonable properties of particles based on their conventional charge (oxidation state)
It is also necessary to know the parts forming during the chemical reaction
It is not difficult to predict acid-based properties of particles undergoing chemical interaction
Now we proceed to predict the chemical properties of any complex compounds based on their formulas
Let's start with hydrogen sulfide, which contains the characteristic unpleasant smell of one of the hydrogen compounds of chalcogenes
In its structural formula, we determine the number of types of reactions corresponding to the properties of acidity and validity, indicating the corresponding oxidation state over the form of each atom
Hydrogen cations - acids positive charging (k) sulfuric anion C2 ~ - negative charging base (n)
In addition, the hydrosulfide group has a reasonable negative charge property ~ N5, since it can have reasonable properties as a donor, transferring the finished sulfur vapor electron
It turns out that all the chemical properties of hydrogen sulfide can be 4 types, preliminary based on its structural formula.
The fact that one of the types of chemical properties of hydrogen sulfide corresponds to validity can be distinguished depending on the type of their conventional charges
Now, given the example of 4 types of reactions proving acid-based properties of hydrogen sulfide, we briefly explain which reaction the abbreviated ionic equations approach:
C + Pb () 2	=	PbS i	+ 2HN03 abbreviated view:
(where n means addition-decomposition-addition-n - base k - acid t - salt a - break)
Base - magnesium atom Mg to acid-hydrogen cation in the composition of hydrogen sulfide of its electron
N	as a result of transfer neutralization, salt is formed MgS
Consider the type of reasonable reaction to sulfur atoms
The oxidation state is 2 bases (oxidizer), due to the fact that, depending on the acid (oxidative) forces of the active partners, stable 3 products can be formed, 3 types of chemical reaction can be recorded:
Examples are:
This chemical reaction is disabled - the attachment is of the type of reaction
Let us try to predict the PH-acid-based properties of phosphine, a known compound from hydrogen compounds of phosphorus formed from two atoms of non-metals
The spatial structure of the phosphine molecule is trigonal pyramidal
From the structural formula it can be seen that the phosphine molecule is characterized by 3 types of chemical reactions (1 - acidity 2 - basic)
First, give an example of type 2:
The type of reaction of the third type can be determined according to the predicted amount of products produced by phosphine oxidation.
Theoretically, the phosphine ion contained in phosphorus can separate the following 3 types of products depending on the strength of the oxidizing agent characterized by P ~ e:
accordingly, there may be 3 types of such reaction
Here is an example of one or two:
We define the types and types of reaction characterizing the possible chemical actions of one of the most important copper salts - copper sulfate from complex binary horse compounds, based on its structural formula
In its structural formula, we determine the number of types of reactions corresponding to the acid-base properties, indicating the corresponding oxidation state over the form of each atom
The spatial form of copper sulfate is rhombic
4 type of chemical reaction with it: 2-acid 2 - basic
sulfur atoms and acid oxygen anions
validity with negative charge
has the property
Chemical actions,
prove through water equations:
abbreviated view:
CuSOl+	BaCl2          =     CuCl2         +	Abbreviated BaSOi type:
When copper sulfate is heated, three products are formed as a result of the molecular oxidation-oxidation process, including a base for converting the ion ~ Q2 to oxygen, and the oxidation level is + 6 sulfur atoms
- - acid properties can be seen to form a stable oxidative product
That is, due to this chemical reaction, acidic and reasonable chemical interactions characteristic of copper sulfate are clearly manifested.
Let us try to determine the types of reaction that characterize the possible chemical actions of nitric acid stable in a free state among the known oxygen acids of nitrogen, based on its structural formula
In its structural formula, we determine the number of types of reactions corresponding to the acid-base properties, indicating the corresponding oxidation state over the form of each atom
2-acid 4 2
- validity
Hydrogen cation I and nitrogen atomic acids	oxygen anions 0 and nitrate anion l: 0 = 0 express fundamental properties of negative charge
To prove it, it is necessary:
consider the chemical interaction equations:
+	2HN03          =	C Q(J V 0 3  ) 2         +	+	WITH	abbreviated view:
5 +	2HN03=	N250 ± +	2NO	Abbreviated T type:
By heating nitric acid it is possible to see formation of three products as a result of intramolecular redox process, including base of conversion of ion 0 to oxygen.
Let us dwell on the type of acid reaction according to the nitrogen atom
5 different chemical reactions can be recorded due to the fact that 5 products associated with the reasonable (oxidative) power of partners interacting with the acid are equal to the oxidation state + 5
Let us give examples of two of them:
It is clear that the chemical interactions of inorganic simple and complex compounds can be previously predicted by prescribing the structural formula of the substance, respectively, the types and types of chemical reactions.
Of course, for him M
Usanovich has to not only study the modern application of the foundations of theory, but also train more
In particular, H action acid and base in modern chemistry
There is not a single universal theory that could explain everything deeper in a simple qualitative and quantitative way, like Usanovich's theory
Therefore M
Guided by Usanovich's generalizing theory, based on the method of anticipating the presence of acid-based properties of any simple and complex compounds in general and inorganic chemistry, based on their chemical formulas, in advance insures students from the risk of remembering chemical reactions only in a learned form and increases the possibilities of practical work with the development of logical thinking.

Ionic equilibrium instability constant of complex compounds
Theoretical introduction
External spherical dissociation of complex salts occurs almost completely, for example, [Ag (NH)] CI - [Ag (NH)] + + CI-
This dissociation is called primary [1 177 b
Reversible decay of the inner sphere of the complex compound is called secondary dissociation
For example, diamincumis ion is dissociated according to the following scheme:
As a result of secondary dissociation, complex parts will establish an equilibrium between the central ion and the ligand
Dissociation [Ag (NH3) 2] is characterized by an equilibrium constant called the instability constant of the complex ion [2 177 b
The value of the instability constant of ions of various complexes fluctuates in large frames and can have a stable value of the complex
The more stable the complex ion, the lower the constant of its instability
For example, between the same type of compounds with different instability constants
The value of the instability constant of some complexes is given in Table 1
The instability constant, which includes the concentrations of ions and molecules, is called concentration
Is an instability constant with the activity of ions and molecules instead of concentrations independent of the ionic strength and composition of the solution [9 233 b
Instability constant of some complex ions in aqueous solution at 250C

With [Zn2 +] = x, the ammonia concentration is 4x and the concentration of non-precipitating ions is 1-x.
We put values ​ ​ in the formula of the instability constant:
Because of the value of x below 1, the value of x cannot be considered in the particle section:
Ammonia concentration: 40	-3	-2
We calculate the degree of ionization:
How much ammonia moline should be added to the cadmium chloride solution of 01 M 1 L to bring the concentration of cadmium ions to 2-10-6 mol/L?
Outcome
1) Cadmium chloride dissociates to form 01 mol/l Cd2 +:
The concentration of Cd2 + ions, including ammonia, decreases when there is a reaction:
We fix an unknown concentration of ammonia through x
You can ignore the values of 2-10-6
Calculate the concentration of Ag + ions in the solution containing 1 L 01 mol AgNO3 and 2 mol KCN

Outcome
Dissolution of silver iodide in thiosulfate solution:
Equilibrium constant:
Silver iodide passing into the solution denotes the amount of moles through x
Place these values in the equilibrium constant:
If you ignore x main in the part section:
Silver iodide can be dissolved in 1 M 1 L H O solution, respectively 235-10-4 mol
If 235-10-4 mol of silver iodide dissolves in a solution of 1 L of N C, then 425-10-4 mol:
Ion instability constant [Ag (CN) 2] is 1-10-21
Calculation of silver ion concentration in solution 001 mol/l KCN and 005 M K [Ag (CN) 2]
Outcome
The secondary dissociation of the complex ion occurs according to the following equation:
With respect to the excess amount of CN- ions resulting from the dissociation of KCN, the amount of CN- ions produced by the secondary dissociation can be ignored, since this equilibrium is shifted there.
Therefore, the uniform concentration of [Ag (CN)] ions can be equal to the total concentration of the complex salt (005 mol/L).
Under the terms of the order:
From here we express the concentration of Network ions:
The displacement of the dissociation equilibrium of a system containing complex ions is determined by the rules in solutions of a simple electrolyte: the equilibrium is shifted to the side of the complexing or ligand with complete binding, so the concentration of unbound particles in the solution has a minimum value
Solutions of simple cadmium salts form a precipitate of cadmium hydroxide CD (OH) 2 with alkalis, hydrogen sulfide - cadmium sulfide CDS
When alkali is added to solution 005 M K2 [Cd (CN) 4] containing 01 M KCN, no precipitate is formed, and when hydrogen sulfide passes through this solution, a CDS precipitate is formed.
How do you explain this? [Cd (CN) 4] - ion instability constant
Outcome
The precipitation condition of CD (OH) 2 and CDS can be recorded as follows:
In case of supply, the concentration of Cd2 + ions in the complex salt solution is calculated as follows:
The concentration of O-ions necessary for overnight stays of cadmium hydroxide is unequal:
Thus, in the considered system at concentration of ions IT is less than 1 mol/l balance is displaced towards ionic structure of a complex
The condition for the formation of cadmium sulfide precipitate from potassium tetracyanocadmate solution is indicated by the following inequality:
At the extreme concentration of sulfide ions, respectively, the equilibrium is completely shifted towards the formation of cadmium sulfide:

That is, in solution:
We put the obtained equilibrium concentrations into the equation of the instability constant:
Values 002 and 12 above x then:
Concentration of Cu2 + ions in the appropriate solution 81 -10-14 mol/l
Is the silver bromide precipitate formed if a potassium bromide solution of 20 ml of 01 M is added to the salt solution of 10 ml of 001 M No.
Outcome
When mixing solutions, the concentration of the substance changes:
Al	30	mol/l = 666-10	mol/l Complex ion [AgS2O3] - decomposes into ions according to the following scheme:
If we denote the concentration of network ions x mol/l, then the concentration of C O is x, and the concentration of the complex ion is 0
Potassium bromide as a strong electrolyte is completely dissociated by sending the bromine ion 666-10-2 mol/l to the solution
Accordingly, in this solution, [Ag +] [Br-] product: 223-10-6 - 666-10-2 = 1485-10-8 = 148-10-7
148-10-7 > 53-10-13 (EK· = 53-10-13) silver bromide falls into the precipitate
If in a solution containing 005 mol of K3 [Cu (CN) 4] K2 [Cd (CN) 4] and 01 mol of KCN, the concentration of S2- ions in such a volume includes 15-10-5 mol/l of sulfide, which substance falls into the Cu2S or CdS precipitate?
Outcome
1) calculate Q} S precipitation:
[Cu +] = x mol/l [CN- = 01 + x mol/l [Cu (CN) 4] 3- = 005-x mol/l is denoted therein:
Since the value of x is not very large, you can take 005 - x = 005 01 + x = 01
Then:
x = 25-10-25 respectively [Cu +] = 25-10-25 mol/l
Find the product of concentration:
We determine the formation of sediment CdS:
[Cd2 +] = x mol/l [CN-] = 01 + x mol/l [Cd (CN)] 2- = 005-x mol/l then:

Structure of the path of bitumen emulsions oil bitumen anionic and cationic emulsifier soil conglomerate
Road construction is the most popular branch of the national economy of Kazakhstan
Every year, a large amount of material is required for the new construction and repair of existing roads, including the beginning of the repair of asphalt concrete bitumen-forming
Increased traffic has placed a much greater burden on road surfaces, creating new challenges
In road construction, bitumen is used in various forms as a binder
At low temperatures, the bitumen binder comes from a liquid into a solid form, so it is unsuitable for creating road surfaces
In this regard, at present, scientists and road service experts cannot but note that there is an increasing interest in bringing bitumen into operation in various ways, that one of the methods of heating the connector to high temperatures leads to air pollution
Liquefied bitumen is now widely used to solve this problem
However, the release of a large amount of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere due to the application of this approach has a great impact on the environment
The use of liquefied pots only reduces the specific consumption of the connector when laying the pavement (note that it increases the cost than the solvent drain) and carries the cost of dissolving it in bitumen heating boilers
The main causes of premature violations of road surfaces depend on the quality and properties of physical and mechanical connectors
Road bitumen produced at oil refineries in terms of their properties does not correspond to use at temperature in pavement conditions
For this reason, it is required to manufacture a strong alloy of asphalt concrete coating with such stability that a cold-resistant crack does not fall out using various methods and technologies.
Bitumen emulsion (BE) dark brown liquid obtained by grinding bitumen in water with these anionic and cationic emulsifiers
BE is used in road construction as the basis of application on the ground or in the manufacture of cold asphalt concrete mixtures before laying asphalt concrete on the old road surface when treating the surface of road surfaces as a structure of road surfaces and thin protective layers of coatings
Foreign experience shows that the use of BE in road construction saves 30% of bitumen and reduces energy by almost 15 times [1]
Bitumen oil is a known viscosity for the construction and repair of roads
Share of bitumen in Kazakhstan accounts for 26% of total amount of refined oil
In many developed countries, road surfaces using bitumen and bitumen materials account for 90%, thus there is a tendency to completely switch to these types of viscosity
But for the technological eye, bitumen should be used at a minimum viscosity
It can be obtained in three important ways:
heating of bitumen to process temperature (hot method);
liquefaction of flammable and binding bitumen according to the regulations;
emulsification of bitumen with the participation of special substances (bitumen emulsions) in water
The first method is usually used to produce hot impurities in the structure of pouring hot bitumen on a cold surface or surface treatments of primary mineral materials in the production of preheating or soil
This approach has achievements and disadvantages
We can talk about the possibility of obtaining a highly reliable conglomerate (asphalt concrete), and the disadvantages are the provision of a limited time for the construction of structural road clothing of energy costs when heating mineral materials for the production of hot mixtures.
The second method, due to the use of expensive solvents that fly away for a short time, is valuable and dangerous and leads to environmental pollution
The third method does not require heating when using bitumen emulsions and has the ability to use both cold and wet mineral materials.
This, of course, is traditional
Compared to hot technology, will reduce energy costs by up to 40%
Emulsion is a thermodynamic oscillatory system consisting of two or more abnormal liquid phases, which is a second liquid phase of the first form (dispersed phase) with small droplets of small size without one constant liquid phase (dispersed medium)
Depending on the dispersion medium and dispersion phase, bitumen emulsions are classified directly and vice versa [2]
In travel practices, direct (standing) bitumen emulsions are most often used
The emulsion can be manufactured depending on the properties using the appropriate process and coupling (binding) material using various applications (surfactant polymer solvents) or in different coupling bitumens without the use of these impurities
Thus, during transportation and storage, emulsions can be developed at different rates depending on the assigned and operating conditions of their stability and decomposition
Emulsion used for roofing coatings shall be split at slow speed
Straight (straight) bitumen emulsions with low binding properties (streams) have good ability to treat in aqueous medium (from 30 to 50%) without drying and heating of stone materials
The application of such technological properties of bitumen emulsions in road construction is favorable for the positions of environmental protection and labor protection of road workers
In theoretical developments and practices with extensive experience in the application of bitumen emulsions, France will lead around the world
In France, more than 30% of the total volume of organic connectors for road purposes are used in thickened form [3]
In Russia, in the mid-60s, thanks to the basics of research work and experience in practice (exercises), technical and regulatory documents for the preparation and use of bitumen emulsions in road structures were mastered
The emulsion is a mixture of two liquid phases arranged in droplets inside the first
Liquid dispersion phase (internal phase) creating droplets immiscible with the second liquid
Droplets are called phase or dispersion medium with melting liquid external closure [4]
Bituminous emulsions are of the type bituminous water soluble or emulsions in the form of fat in water
The drop range is usually from 0001 to 001mm
The content of bitumen in the emulsion is determined from the usual limits of 30-70% of its exemplary use [5]
The bitumen content of the emulsion determined by comparing the dimensions of the two phases has an upper limit
When the peak is reached, the droplets do not deform themselves, the volume cannot accommodate a large number of droplets (a large number)
Due to the fact that the droplets are arranged so tightly that they are partially glued to each other, so that those caught between the droplets in the water turn into water droplets
As a result, aqueous emulsions in oil or invert emulsion arise
Such an emulsion has high frequency natural bitumen
The elements of the inner phase are deformed to many sides of various shapes, and the dispersion medium when the thin layer is removed between them is called the dispersion phase with a high content of 74% upper concentrate emulsions
Such emulsions are similar in structure and properties to foams, so they are called "foam emulsion" (foams)
The emulsion from a modern point of view is based on the theory of adsorption shells proposed by Bancroft in 1913
For relatively stable emulsification, special substances called emulsifiers shall be used.
All emulsions (except some self-constructed emulsions) occur only with emulsifiers
Developing the theory of bankrupt, Klaus considered in detail in his work
Series "Natural and Geographical Sciences" No. 2 (48) 2016
The components of the bitumen emulsion include the following:
bitumen (mixture in dispersed phase);
water (mixture in dispersed medium); 3 emulsifiers (surfactant);
acid (in the case of a cationic emulsion) or acid (in the case of an anionic emulsion)
a number of impurities are the same as in the disperse phase and in the disperse medium (solid stabilizer solution)
Oxidized oil bitumen is used as the main igniter
Advantages of bitumen emulsion
Application of bitumen emulsion provides for improvement of quality of road construction and repair works
In the Kursk region in 2005, 7,900 tons were produced in 2006 - 6,950 tons of bitumen emulsion
Belarus has 3 plants for production of bitumen emulsion
All operating industries are based on the bitumen emulsion device of the German company BREINING
Road bitumen heated to high temperature by the main competitor of bitumen emulsion
When using such bitumen in road construction and repair work, there are many drawbacks:
the weakness of interfacing bitumen with the main surface of the road; homogeneity of the surface layer or weak decomposition;
the need for a process of dewatering the cleaned surface;
high temperature due to high energy consumption;
heated bitumen is used due to increased risk of work at high temperatures
The emulsion is bituminous with respect to road bitumen:
a good combination of bitumen with the base of the pathway (good adhesion) due to the involvement of a negative charge in the right charge of the cationic emulsion on the main surface of the pathway;
the liquid of the emulsion is close to algae, so it is smoothly burned, filling the existing surface layer;
the bitumen emulsion may be poured into an aqueous layer;
it is not necessary to maintain a high temperature, that is, less energy is consumed;
application of bitumen emulsion at 30-700С temperature makes operation safe [9]
Emulsion application does not require high power consumption
And cement-bitumen connectors used in cold asphalt concrete production to close airfields are not inferior to a hot connector based on ordinary bitumen [10]
Bituminous emulsion can be used as base layer and as material for repair of soft coating [11-12]
In general, the cost-effectiveness of bitumen emulsion is high
Thanks to the high fluidity, the mineral filler can burn very thinly, which will save up to 30% of bitumen and save 40% of energy on heating, facilitate the transportation of goods
Such economic savings cover the operating costs of emulsion components and devices
The capital cost of installing such devices pays off in 4 years
Emulsification of bitumen in water can be considered as a promising development of the road construction industry
To upgrade to this technology, you need to solve the following problems:
investigation of emulsion content using different raw materials;
studies of its operational and rheological properties;
finding various modifiers that enhance the essential properties of the bitumen emulsion; control of the effects of various mineral fillers under different conditions;
to improve the viscous properties of the bitumen emulsion, especially for the production of high-contact emulsions
Module of oil energy generation elective course of gas-energy applied chemistry
The 21st Century Stream Has Presented Unprecedented Technological and Technological Advances to Humanity
Since Kazakhstan became one of the oil-producing countries of the world, the orientation of future young people on this profession has become one of the most pressing issues and today does not raise relevance
The system of general education is a single structure reflecting the main directions of the achievement of world civilization, determining the prospects for the development of each country
Currently, one of the pressing problems of today is the training of qualified national personnel of a high level of education in universities who can solve the problem in any complex professional field that has deeply mastered their specialty and become a true patriot of their country
In particular, the study of natural sciences, especially chemistry, is one of the most important and popular in the modern world.
This industry is very closely related to other industries
The most relevant currently are chemistry and energy sources
Kazakhstan is rich in energy resources, but it is still not fully developed and studied
Despite the large reserves of raw materials, there are fewer specialists in the country who contribute to the further development
Therefore, knowledge of this industry is one of the most pressing problems
Now in the country master specialties in higher educational institutions
However, this is not enough
Because at present, almost all enterprises or industries employ workers from abroad
Even in some specialties in chemistry and energy sources, a small number of hours are allocated and are not fully provided
In view of these circumstances, a training module "Chemistry and energy sources" is proposed to compensate for these shortcomings.
A lot of work has been done at our national university to educate future specialists of the country with a focus on competence
One of them is the number of specialties in the master's and doctoral levels of education and the number of students admitted to them increases annually
Studying at the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technologies with a degree in 6M011200-Chemistry
undergraduates hold the subject "Applied Chemistry"
The content of this course, in particular, in all areas of international law chemistry, in the field of medicine and construction, food industry, energy, heavy industry, household chemistry, etc.
includes industry communications
One of the main modules of applied chemistry - chemical and energy sources
This module consists of 4 hours of lectures and 2 hours of seminar
However, to reveal the full content of such a topical topic, this number of allocated hours is not enough
At the same time, everyone knows that this module still does not provide educational and methodological complexes of a full nature in the course of applied chemistry without final laboratory and practical work, especially the program of elective courses and methodological manuals for teachers in Kazakh
Taking into account the above contradictions in this work, we create and propose the structure of the module "Chemistry and energy sources"
The module is divided into 6 headers:
He separately discussed the content of each topic, on each of which a lesson plan and a slide were drawn up
Table 1 Description of topics considered in the module "Chemistry and energy sources"
Laboratory works performed in the module "Chemistry and energy sources"
Topics for students' independent work performed in the module "Chemistry and energy sources"
Currently, as a result of the analysis of the state and issues of the energy industry, Kazakhstan can fully provide itself with fuel and energy resources at the expense of its natural resources and be able to bring fuel and electricity abroad [1]
Overall, energy production has been steadily increasing over the past five years
According to statistics, 712 per cent of fuel and energy resources consist of natural resources [2]
Today, alternative power generation will allow the introduction of advanced world technologies and implement energy-efficient programs
Therefore, attention to alternative energy sources should be paid now
Kazakhstan forms green economy pool closely linked with bringing traditional energy sources to green level through development of alternative energy sources and introduction of new energy technologies
Currently, the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind and the Sun, at a high level is difficult to say
Share of renewable energy sources in the whole country according to the estimates of specialists
1 percent [4]
Today, the bowels of Kazakhstan are rich in natural minerals, there is no energy shortage
However, alternative energy sources are certainly a necessity of the future
This module is studied in chemical specialties in universities of the Republic of Kazakhstan
designed for the elective course "Applied Chemistry"
In conclusion, we believe that the new type of module of this combined elective course, along with the further development of chemical science, will reflect the connection of chemistry with energy sources and become an irrefutable source of information for future specialists working in this field.

Solid domestic waste soil and asphalt concrete compounds, heavy oil waste dehydrated by oil
One of the topical issues in connection with the economic prosperity of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the growth of giants now is the processing of solid household waste
More than 3 million tons of solid domestic waste per year in Almaty, of which more than 30% are construction waste
An example of using them to process secondary raw materials in another industry necessary by the national economy; in the automotive industry, as a bedding layer of the road, it is allowed to use on the construction of footpaths and various construction sites (concrete walls concrete bridges, pipe floorings are fenced with concrete bricks t
According to literature, the amount of various building waste in the world exceeds 25 billion tons per year
In Kazakhstan alone, about 3 million annually.
more than 30% of them are solid waste left from construction
That is, they are formed from the repair of various buildings during the reconstruction of buildings and structures
Of these, concrete and brick debris reach 80% of the total volume [12]
Such a large accumulation of construction waste requires the disposal and processing or disposal of their removal
In this regard, the timely disposal or misuse of waste will lead to environmental pollution and the reduction of the necessary areas that can serve both for new construction and for agricultural consumption.
Initial information on the use of building waste as secondary raw materials for concrete production in the Soviet Union and abroad 1946
[3 4]
The 70s of the last century began to pay more attention to these issues due to increased environmental requirements for the shortage of natural fillers and an increase in the demolition and overhaul of mentally and physically worn-out buildings required in advanced European states
Currently, at the state level, this issue has been successfully resolved for more than 30 years not only in Europe, but also in the USA and Asian countries
It is worth noting that over the past 10 years, the volume of recycled waste abroad has grown 2-3 times
Energy and environmental issues raise the need to find new technological methods for the processing of heavy oil and oil wastes by the complexity of their structure
When drilling oil wells, soils and groundwater are heavily contaminated by drilling mud containing heavy metals of polymers and various minerals, as well as by oil spill
This will lead to soil disruption and environmental impacts
Of course, the disposal of such a variety of industrial and building wastes using optimal approaches harmful to the environment will be cost-effective and environmentally effective for each State.
Oil sludge and contaminated soil are extremely dangerous to the environment
Oil sludge - the remains of the main petrochemical enterprise are sent to special warehouses intended for storage immediately without its actual use
Sludge remains collected in warehouses for several years
Such places (sludge collectors) are located in large territories
The use of these lands is unacceptable and causes enormous environmental damage by polluting the soil layer of water through evaporation and absorption of petroleum products.
Therefore, the issue under consideration is relevant and important on a state scale

Competitors - fox and steppe cat
Protection measures taken
In the Ustyurt reserve it is protected in Aktau-Bosachinsky and Karakia-Karakul reserves [2 252b 9 3-7 p]
In conclusion, based on the research of modern scientists, the issue of preserving biological diversity and thereby preserving the stocks of various genes found in groups of living organisms is relevant.
Every State has an obligation to fully restore all biological wealth in its territory in order to ensure sustainable economic development
Measures to preserve diversity in Kazakhstan will be carried out on a legislative basis
We believe that, subject to the requirements of the laws adopted in the country on the protection of living organisms, endangered animals will be restored
State reserves, national natural parks and areas where nature reserves restore rare and endangered animals and plants

Secondly, the prevention of overpopulation
The northern border of the location of racehorses passes in Kazakhstan through the lower reaches of the Ural River through Ulytau, Aktobe region
Through the Karaganda region to the Pavlodar region further through Semipalatinsk through the west and southwest of the Kalbinsky atyr Altai into the Zaysan depression
The southern border of its distribution passes through Ustirt to the northeastern coast of the Aral Sea
The life of racehorses on the left bank of the Syr Darya is controversial
Further, the border runs along the lower reaches of the Shu and Sarysu rivers
Racecourse is common in Moyynkum in Dzharkent in the upper Tekes and Kegen rivers in the Balkhash-Alakol depression
in the south-east of Kazakhstan no less than in the north-east
In oysters, twin racehorses inhabit all clay and sandy biotopes, but the largest are found in places with a large number of ephemera
In some areas of Ustirt, the amount of these impurities in 1961 amounted to 05 copies per 1 km of vehicles

On the Genghisau ridge and 108 km north of Karkaralyl 20, more than 16 catches were encountered
31 hunts for 700 traps
In the south-east of Kazakhstan in various expositions there are examples of mountain areas of Ketmen and the Kegen plain
These killer whales were also found in the Bugyty Mountains near the Saryozek station in part of the Kegen Pass
In the 152-kilometer direction, 43 people collided, of which 34 caught 650 traps and 16 hunters
In 2008, 29 heads of 100 traps were caught on the right bank of the Ili River on the plain of the bell
Belongs to a mixed group of eating double racehorses, as part of their nutrition, all nutrition occurs the same
Nutrition of killer horses living in the north of the island, mainly insects, plant rhizomes
The vast majority of the feed of these animals in the south-east of Kazakhstan in the summer are grain crops
In Ust-Kamenogorsk and Karkaralinsky district of Central Kazakhstan in the upper zone of the Sarysu River near the Zhanarka station
Bekenov and M.
In the stomach of 8 killer whales examined by Ismagulov, the remains of wood of plants and leaves of small beetles and ants were found
Seeds and leaves of plants are found in the same amount, and fruiting - about 25%
A lot of list of eating plants
Racecards belong to other major optional dreams
The timing of their sleep and awakening depends on meteorological environmental conditions, including snow falling on the ground
Sleep duration is mainly 4 months
Hibernation in southeast Kazakhstan mainly falls in March, awakening in February is extremely rare
Hibernation date end October early November [2 38-42 b
Hibernation period in Central Kazakhstan early November
In some years, twins fall asleep in October
Animals come out mainly at night, 20-50 minutes after sunset, and in autumn come out later than in spring and summer
It will be late and in strong winds
The time of the double outside is about 5-6 hours, but this time differs in each season and depends on the meteorological situation
The radius of separation from the needle of the joint is 90 meters
Running speed 80 m/s
Maximum life expectancy of racecourses 3-4 years
There are two types of kosak ins - summer and winter
In the conditions of Central Kazakhstan, the entrance to the summer needle of the killer whale will be open during the day
Turkey depth 30-40 centimeters below the surface of the earth
Opening in the mouth 5-7 centimeters
Each permanent needle has temporary turkey at once
All of them are located at a distance of 200-300 meters among themselves, but in some places there are 5-6 yen at 25 meters
The needle entrance mouth has a diameter of 10 centimeters and a single path to the socket chamber without any turns
The length of the access road is 70-150 centimeters
Dry grass fits into the chamber and is located at a depth of 20-50 centimeters
Some turkeys have additional undercuts and additional outlets
Each double has a maximum of 3 in
On the North Island, wintering mother sausages give offspring twice a year than on the second generation of the first generation.
The maximum number of births of this species will be seven
Newlyweds do not participate in fertilization
In Karakum in the Aral Sea region from April to June, chicks feeding children are found throughout the summer until the beginning of September
Reflection of this species occurs late and long
Duration of hypothermia 20 days
In South-East Kazakhstan, paise killer whales met between April and July, and nursing children in August
Some twins give offspring twice [3 27-31b]
In the highlands of Southeast Kazakhstan and the North-Eastern regions of the East Kazakhstan region, the increase in racehorses will last 15-20 days
This species has a long breeding time
Maturation of the sexual structure depends on the environment
The main enemies of the racecourse are birds of prey and animals
Including the main enemies of wild cats-racehorses
Sometimes dogs have food
Boers belonging to Ophtalmapsylla relative met in Almaty region in Kyrgyzstan
Internal parasites include beetles of the family Scavabeidae, belonging to the genus of soft worms Phys alopteva and Physalocephalus
In Kazakhstan, there is no epizooological significance due to the small number of these twins
Racegoers found in Transbaikalia quickly take the plague
In 1988, zoologist L.
Burdelov met near the Aral Sea
They are also carriers of pathogenic microbes
It is the causative agent of the infectious disease of microbes pseudotubered by intestinal persiniosis salmonellosis and so on [4 c
Horses can be harmful to crops
Wheat grain found in each of three detained killer whales in South-East Kazakhstan
In some places of Transbaikalia Mongolia harms fresh buckwheat potatoes
Racegoers benefit from eating dangerous insects
Hibernation of racehorses in Central Kazakhstan will take 4-5 months
At the end of March in early April they can be seen on the ground even earlier
But due to changing weather conditions in some years, first of all, A.
Bekenov and M
Depends on snow cover than Ismagilov's study
Activity of racehorses in Central Kazakhstan will begin from sunset
But the time for racehorses to leave the needle varies depending on the season
In spring in April you can meet racehorses 20 minutes after sunset
Daily activity lasts an average of 8 hours (± 30 minutes)
Unlike other individuals, rhinos breastfeeding children come out of the late yoke
Killer whales enter the needles at 5 and 6 a.m., that is, 30-40 minutes before sunrise
In summer (June July), turkey caching occurs
40 minutes after sunset, that is, at 2300 o'clock, they can be seen on the ground
Daily activity in summer averages 6 hours (± 30 minutes)
Needle entry time at 430 a.m. and about 5
In autumn in October, killer whales come out of turkey like in the summer, but needles account for 60-80 minutes earlier than in other seasons
Average activity 6 hour 30 minutes (± 30 minutes)
It should be noted that young doubles can meet in the morning and afternoon
In summer, these young individuals will begin to live independently
And by autumn, along with young octopuses, you can see adults during the day, because they begin to collect the necessary oil on the body to lie down in a short sleep, and the temperature decreases [5 159 p]
In general, knowledge of microbes carrying pathogenic microbes in the prevention of infectious diseases is of great importance for human health, as they are the causative agents of microbes of pseudotuberculous intestinal persiniosis of salmonellosis and other infectious diseases.
At the same time, it should be noted that in later data on doubles and scientific works, some questions about the ecology of their biology are still relevant for study.

Biological education Environmental concepts Environmental principles Evolution biogeography nature
In accordance with Ministry of Education and Science Order No. 115 of 3 April 2013 (annex 37), a model curriculum on the subject "Biology" was approved for grades 6 to 11 of secondary schools, according to which the content of biological education was revised, textbooks and textbooks were published, on the basis of which they were revised and supplemented
As a result, it is noted that pedagogical approaches in the study of discipline - knowledge-intensive and continuity of topics ensured the development of concepts with basic biological concepts and the formation of evolutionary and ecological thinking, ranging from the level of the organism of the biosystem to the levels above.
At the same time, the orientation towards the perception of the integrity of nature as the basis of the life of living systems and a deep understanding of the role of man in these processes is obvious.
The purpose of teaching in the framework of textbooks on biology: the structure and diversity of the life of the organic world, the evolutionary theory of the relationship of living organisms between the fauna of ecological thinking and the diversity of flora is that the role of man in nature is that the cellular structure of living organisms is the result of a diverse evolution in wildlife in biocenosis.
The programme focuses more on environmental issues by significantly reducing anatomical and morphological material
From the first lesson of studying the relationship of organisms and the environment with various features of flora and fauna and studying the meaning in nature and human life to the last lesson, environmental concepts and concepts are systematically presented [11-2
Also, the tasks of teaching biology textbooks are clearly set
In particular, the development of the cognitive interest of students in the study of the organic world, the continuous transfer and development of the development of education, interdisciplinary relations (geography of chemistry of mathematics physics, t
) knowledge of the patterns of life phenomena of the idea of ​ ​ the unity of the world clearly owes
The thematic content of the biology course is based on a block position
The first general section of each topic provides a general description of the system group under consideration; The second part provides for the features of biodiversity and the ecology of trained taxa
Another feature of textbooks in the study of biology is the integration of various subjects in school, especially ecology and medicine
That is, interdisciplinary communication in the process of teaching biology -
"Kazakh language" "Literature" (enrichment of vocabulary reserves with biological terms)
); "Mathematics" - the reflection of quantitative and qualitative indicators in the conclusion of experimental observations and laboratory work of biological experiments; "Physical geography" provides for the regularity of areas of biodiversity unification by natural zones of fauna and flora distribution on earth; "Chemistry" - the development of the organic world from the cellular level of organisms to the biosphere
the formation and development of the migration of chemical elements in them provides for the formation of ideas about "living substances" in the nature of RNA and DNA activities;
"Music" - the use of musical passages in the study of some topics of biology leaves a very effective influence; "Fine art" - the image of animals and birds of flower plants, of course, will leave an aesthetically positive effect
Deepening students' biological knowledge is a requirement of today
It has multi-vector sides
The most important thing is the increase in global environmental disasters on Earth
That is, many do not know about the limitlessness of life in the biosphere
It is time to recognize that the main causes of environmental disasters in the educational space are the ecological illiteracy of mankind
And the only way to eliminate environmental illiteracy among many is to give basic biological knowledge within the school in accordance with modern requirements
One of its main provisions is the greening of the content of the subject
In fact, traditional education still continues in the branches of biological science
That is, "Botany" "Zoology" "Anatomy and physiology of humans and animals" "General biology" and t.
on the basis of subjects, one-sided education prevailed
Consequently, the integrity of the legality of life will remain
As a result, the worldview of natural resources comes from its own laws of nature (equilibrium of nature, self-regulation and
) was contradictory
Its world practices and results are contamination of the ozone layer of the global climate, toxic heat-efficient noses, pollution of the world's water channels.
The question of limiting the further prevention of these environmental problems is before the entire human community
Therefore, the issue of greening production and agriculture in the world scientific and educational space is on the agenda
Environmental education and upbringing have become a tradition of mother's milk transmission.
In the field of education, the Republic has begun training specialists in ecologically significant subjects, from lyceum college to universities.
All this can be called innovative processes in the field of science and education
The introduction of a system for assessing and measuring the focus of the Sovereign Kazakhstan on the integration of the content of education and the search engine in the educational process, focused on results for adolescents, from the first days in the field of education, such valuable innovative proposals as the popularization of applied educational opportunities in the educational process begin to be introduced into the educational process
The result was not bad
Own textbooks in native language (new generation textbooks) are written from sovereign Kazakhstan
The most important thing is that the integration and greening of the content of items relevant to date is implemented
We see this in the school subjects "Physical Geography" "Natural Science" "Chemistry" "Physics" "Biology"
Among disciplines
On the role and place of the subject "biology" in the formation of concepts with environmental concepts
We decided to ask the question by analyzing grades 6-9
The content of the basic education of the subject of biology for the 6th grade of textbooks of the new generation consists of the following sections: "General acquaintance with plants" "Construction of a plant cell" "Fruits and seeds of flowering plants" "Basic life actions of plants" "Main sections of the plant world" "Diversity of the plant world" and "Natural associations"
Let us dwell on the role and place of environmental concepts and concepts in these sections
In the section "In the preamble" and in the section "General knowledge of plants," for the first time, students are systematically taught in scientific language about the diversity of plants on Earth, their prevalence in nature and human life, cultural and wild forms of art and medicinal forms
For students, this section has a great place and role
When communicating with students associated with student skills, you should be interested in specific examples of the role of all types of plant in human life and explain that the family needs vegetation as a living organism or every person
Each member of the plant (root breed of fruit seeds) must be associated with human life
It is especially important to teach the diversity of plants and forms of life to environmentally and biologically evaluate useful and harmful species
"Plant species" "Life form" "Environmental factors" "Environmental effect" pays special attention to the role of plants in human life, giving their real position such concepts as "Change during the year"
At the same time, teaching students
instills environmental concepts with aesthetic education of feelings filled with love for the plant
As a result, the first system of concepts "necessary environmental protection" of students starting to treat the plant correctly will be stabilized
The section "Members of the cell structure of plants - seeds of flowering fruits" presents a group of important systems of environmental concepts
To give an environmental idea of ​ ​ "cell building," first of all, so that students who began to get acquainted with the plant make sure that the plant is a living organism
Schoolchildren will be able to travel through the "cell life" through a microscope and learn for the first time about the secrets of biology and environmental sciences
Now students are moving to the role of a person who promotes in their family and living environment the need to protect them from cruelty to the plant as a living organism in the classroom or on salt at home [2 28-38b]
In the following sections of biology, students learn about plant members such as flower fruits with roots, study the relationship between them and the relationship with the environment
Also, under the section "Basic vital actions of plants," they will study the role of matter and energy exchanger in the process of photosynthesis with sunlight and chlorophyll
That is, the schoolboy will be ready to take part in measures to increase and protect yard crops and garden gardens, ecologically significant places and the role of plants in nature and human life in steppe forest-steppe and highland mountains
We evaluate it through the participation of schoolchildren in the Green Belt Green Energy Zhasyl El campaign in the village and city
The integrated presentation of environmental concepts and concepts of this class is well reflected in the section "Natural associations"
Here, as a biological system, the concept of natural plant associations (biocenosis - phytocenosis) is widely formulated from a theoretical and practical point of view
Ecology of biological and abiotic relationships and relationships between plants broadens the ecological outlook of students
The idea of ​ ​ biocenosis and the ecosystem spurs readers to socio-patriotic events, such as promoting the role of the Red Book in protecting the nature of the native land of plant protection, or, among other things, again becomes a nationalist patriot of his homeland
As a result, a healthy person will be formed, protecting the nature of his native land, determining the place of students in public environmental education and education
The content of basic education of the 7th grade of the educational discipline "Introduction" consists of the sections "Classification of animals" "Development of the animal world on earth" "Natural associations"
One of the features of this section is that it will not be so difficult for students to correctly use the environmental knowledge of grades 6
The main thing to know is by comparing the difference between the plant and animal worlds and the pattern of similarities from the cell structure to the biosphere level
It is especially important to know the principle that the plant and animal world cannot live without each other, in terms of harmony with the legislation of the unity of nature
And the system of environmental concepts and concepts in this section - in each world of animals; cellular organism is a medium-adapted environmental factor of biocenose biocenose biocenose biocenose spread of the biosphere for the sustainable development of evolution and t.
is constantly repeated
Students will be able to receive deep education by learning about the biological ecological characteristics of organisms with one- and unpretentious nutritional organisms with nutritious nutrition of plant animals, so that they play a key role in the development of the zoological branch of biology.
It is especially important to consolidate knowledge of the process of movement of the nutrient chain between organisms using real and real practices
For example, plankton - > zoophytoplankton - > protozoa vertebrates - > predatory - > bacteria
If you show this process through individual representatives of organisms: algae - animals and vegetation - rhinos - microparticles - fish - macro-containing bacteria - rotten fungi
Through this scheme, it is necessary to conduct animated mobile presentation lectures or practical exercises
That is, through this process, phytophage students zoophytophage zoophytophage parasitic and t
Aware of the types of nutrition, they will transform the close connection between plants and animals into life skills that metabolism and energy, absorbing their needs into each other, should have sufficient sources of absence in nature of any unnecessary organisms.
The biology department has a lot of materials that reveal the place and role of representatives of individual types in nature and human life
Especially cow-shaped chain worms according to the "Type of flatworms"; The concept of "parasitism" through the ascarid point and its bioecological significance in relation to the parasite and the owner very effectively develop the biological knowledge of students about the role and significance of their place in nature and human life
Bioecological deep education as nutritious, adapting the practical importance of a biocenosis by Wednesday through representatives of the Kalmar cuttlefish on "Types of poisons" if materials about the Like Buysky Worms fur coat open an office role of a biocenosis of a biocenosis
The use of computer technology in laboratory work through these representatives will strengthen the role of activating the creative abilities of students
Biology is very rich in biological and environmental concepts and concepts "Joint type"
Now this is a vivid and consistent example of explaining to students the environmental relationship between "plant-animals"
First of all, students should be taught to distinguish between "shayantaris" and "arachnids" (insects), that is, three of them are representatives of grades 3
Because the public has long been negative about "crustacean insects"
Therefore, highlighting the role of representatives of 3 classes in agriculture and medicine, the formation of a positive attitude towards them in a new direction is the task of the teacher
Because the "dangerous" "harm" that has developed among the people since tomorrow saves him from the opposite "good," "harmless," because "little friends" have no harm, without nasekoms do not spray, "etc.
transition to frequent application of environmental concepts or concepts
Of course, when passing through these topics, good use is made of forms of lessons and techniques that diversify innovative learning technologies that develop students' own search abilities
The use of environmental science laws in education, linking to life the harmful actions of butterflies in agriculture about the benefits of predatory beetles and cows, especially in the mathematical combination of the transfer properties of tick pathogens, will direct students to protect insects
In this direction, from year to year, it is possible to observe an increase in quantitative indicators of the participation of schoolchildren in scientific projects organized by the Republican Center for Scientific Projects "Daryn"
So, in 2010, the participation of schoolchildren in the actions "Biology" and "Ecology and Environment" in 2015 increased by 35%
Very extensive and important section of biology "Type of winds"
It provides for the biology and ecological condition of mammals - space birds
In addition, children and schoolchildren will recognize representatives of the network from the moment they appear
System of environmental terms found through each topic: "Cascading" environmental code "Environmental қү_қyқ" and t.
laws and principles of environmental legislation should be all and all aimed at environmental education and education of students
Depending on the knowledge and qualifications of the teacher, the relationship between each animal and bird fish and frog bear and wolf snake and raven raven and raven eagle and horses should be explained on the basis of the scientific and ecological biological pedagogical national tradition - a natural process (continuous action) that preserves the stability of natural unification (biocenosis)
As a result, a friendly and humane attitude towards the unprecedented animal world is inevitably formed in the minds of students in the space of thinking [3 45-61 b
Content of basic education in the 8th class of biological education
Any sections of the discipline related to the biological and environmental knowledge and practice of the teacher: the activities of the nervous system of the musculoskeletal system of the organs of the musculoskeletal system should be held as an environmentally problematic lesson in behavior and psyche with the internal environment of the body of the cardiovascular system of respiratory digestive metabolism and energy release and individual development of the heat-regulating organism
Because the place and role of the human child in nature are unique
That is, only a human child is responsible for the life of the entire globe in the biosphere
Life in nature is a continuous process formed earlier than man and developing by its law, or the fruit of the evolution of life on Earth
This stability began to collapse from the moment a conscious person appeared on Earth (Homesapiens)
Of course, not immediately millions -
it is necessary to explain to schoolchildren what happened over the years
Therefore, all natural resources on Earth are necessary to live healthy and happy for the good of man
That is, the task of the teacher to turn the fact that the current fate or sustainable development of nature depends on the minds and minds of mankind into a golden mast of each lesson
And only then will every conscious disciple who realized that without him there is no life for the dignity of nature grow and promote his family and environment of behavior
Therefore, each chapter and division of discipline must be trained in continuity with human members and different systems of activity, linking the place and role as a single organism with the natural environment
Only then does the principle of harmony between biological and environmental concepts and concepts complement each other and deepen the development of students' biological knowledge [4 98-108b]
When studying the sections of the discipline "Metabolism and energy turnover" "Individual development of the body" "Behavioral and mental" it is necessary to consider environmental principles characteristic of the sphere of environmental science "Man and social ecology," with a high bioecological approach to laws and principles in connection with biotic and anthropogenic factors
That is, it is very important to green the individual development of a person and the development of society and its connection with nature through life practices
Human actions in nature are the most important environmental factor
Results of Human and Natural Impacts Environmental Protection Essential to the Preservation of Life on Earth
For this, environmental education should become the core of every lesson - education and culture
As a result, the effectiveness of environmental education and education will lead to the formation of an ecological culture of students
Ecologically cultured personality is a promising environmental management
The content of the basic knowledge of the 9th grade of the educational discipline consists mainly of sections of the fundamentals of evolution and ecology, the basis of genetics and selection of reproduction and individual development of the organism, starting from entry into biology
The peculiarity of class 9 biology is that the biological education of students becomes more difficult
Laws and principles of the theoretical foundations of the most important biological science, the history of the development of science, the foundations of evolution and ecology
Especially in the cellular structure, genetics consists of a system of scientific conclusions that prove the integrity of the nature of the organic world in matters of selection and ecology
The main goal of the discipline is to increase the scientific research activity of students in accordance with their age characteristics
In the future, the worldview is the formation of a full-fledged personality, saturated with a materialistic humanistic view [5 135-240b]
The content of basic education in biology for students in the 9th grade is complete covering its various fields
So, thanks to the chemical structure and activity of the cell - the role as a unity of life - the first new foundations of molecular genetic knowledge were given
In particular, for the first time, the reasons for the reproduction and extinction of self-regulating forms of adaptation of organisms to the environment of organism integrity are scientifically and materialistically explained
Its essence and content prove the unlimited diversity of organisms by human association in order to preserve it for future generations
The content of the subject defines the first elements of the science of genetics and selection, the first foundations of which are transferred in class 10 [6 125 x 138 b
The section of the discipline "Evolution" and "Fundamentals of Ecology" is aimed at approving indigenous materialistic views on the development of life on Earth to students at the intersection of biological and environmental sciences
In this section, for the first time, students are armed with new knowledge of the origin of the species by mastering the evolutionary-biogeographic evidence of the theory of origin of the evolutionary concept
For the first time, students will be provided with knowledge about the isolation of population waves of forces driving the natural type of struggle for life with changing species criteria.
One of the features in the history of biology for secondary schools is the large-scale and problematic transfer of the section "Fundamentals of Ecology"
This section has been granted 11 hours
The purpose of the section is to assess that kindergarten, starting with the family of students, is presented as a generalized conceptual conclusion of biological and environmental education, issued in elementary class and 5-9 grades, and it achieved its goal
The section "Fundamentals of ecology" of the discipline "The place and role of concepts and concepts in the development of biological education are covered by the main branches of environmental science
Each lesson should be presented in a new problem and heuristic form
Especially for students
content is very important in the case of regional global environmental problems.
The participation of schoolchildren in scientific projects on these problems of the district school of the region of the republic, the environmental discussion round table will become the basis for weekly monthly and public events
Already, you can see an increase in research activity of students in grades 6 in the field of biology and ecology
We see this in the data of the Republican Scientific and Methodological Center "Daryn," about which we spoke above [7 85-98 b
As a result, in the basic content of the biology subject for grades 6-9 of the school, the quality of biological and biological education is fully covered in the directions indicated in the model program according to the state standard
However, it is not enough to green the contents of Grade 8 biology
Since the current environmental situation on Earth does not fully cover adolescents, which is a human factor
That is, the content of the subject should be consolidated with the questions "Human Ecology" and "Social Ecology"
And integration with environmental concepts in the development of the quality of biological education is realized in systemic general and continuity by class.
We observe this from the demand of applicants for admission to faculties of medical and environmental orientation in universities of the republic
Typical curriculum of the subject "Biology" for grades 6-9 of the level of basic secondary education

Environmental Impact Assessment Almaty Zoo Ponds
A healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and beautiful city with a healthy urban environment is the future of humanity
Specialists - architects and builders - have two major tasks: to create a high-quality urban environment of life and at the same time to ensure an ecological balance between the city and nature [19 b
The International Union of Zoo Directors (MSDZ), an international zoo organization, as well as a group of animal breeding specialists (GSRN) published the Environmental Protection Strategy of the World Association of Zoos of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (MSOP) (WZCS)
This document can be called the main indicator of the further direction and orientation of the work of zoos
Here, citing data on the popularity of the zoo, the most relevant and relevant is the environmental protection strategy both now and in the future.
WZCS is a public policy document of zoos, which provides for the following environmental goals:
Actively, through concerted programmes, protect the environment while preserving habitats and ecosystems, protecting populations of threatened species within and outside the habitat;
To support the environmental association and to provide services that enhance scientific knowledge and conservation, as well as available relevant knowledge and experience;
To raise public and political awareness of the need to preserve nature in creating new balances between natural resources and man and nature
However, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) seeks to identify rare species on a global scale, such as the types of loss they face
Collects information not only on the increase in the number of endangered species, but also on possible steps taken to prevent the causes and loss of certain rarities, this organization publishes relevant lists
These data are published in the book Red Book [2109 b
According to WZCS, there are about 10,000 zoos in the world, of which 1,200 advanced zoos have about 30,000 species of vertebrates and visit them 619000000 times ("Front" zoo - part of recognized federations or
with input dynasty)
The main reason for the appearance of zoos:
The death of animals as a result of human activity is growing every day;
There are mainly global commitments for the conservation of biological diversity in the world;
Zoos guarantee the preservation of thousands of animal species;
Zoos require and consume a significant amount of resources to fulfill this promise
"To date, there is only one moral justification in the city and any other zoo - the cultivation of extinct species in their subsequent restoration" - John Aspinall (Aspinall) 1991 Hauletz and Director of Zoos Port (Howlettsa and Port Lympne Zoos)
Predicting a favorable defense regime, we try to avoid the extinction of rare species
To a certain extent, forecasting and management is possible without any explanation or explanation; but reliable and accurate procurement is also possible only when we are also able to explain what happens to special circumstances [312 b]
Almaty's main zoo was established in 1937
Almaty Zoo has 7 departments (sections): exotarium aquarium of primate birds of prey from ungulate mammals
The advantages and main reasons for choosing Almaty Zoo as the object of study are:
This is the main zoo of Kazakhstan
There are thousands of interesting animals
Complete unity with nature
Different ways to spend your time positively
Environmental protection and scientific organizations with status
With large area for hiking (21Ha)
Full overhaul of the zoo is provided on the principle of geographical zoning
Africa Asia All animals living in the Arctic Ocean gather in one zone
With special attention to the Concept of animal maintenance, the construction of closed (winter) forillons with new convenient and safe fences is carried out
Long-standing concepts persist to this day up to animal fences
Last year, the number of visitors to the zoo amounted to 420 thousand people
In general, a good indicator, but there were also years of up to a million people
Funding increases by 49 million tenge every year with allocation of 45 million tenge in 2014
However, 60-65% of the funding will be carried out from the local budget
Instruction on Environmental Impact Assessment of Economic and Other Activities (EIA) to be carried out during the development of pre-design and design documentation prior to planning "28
In connection with order No. 204-p of 2007 for the purposes of our research project, we received an "assessment of the environmental impact of the Almaty Zoo"
The project contains the nature and degree of determination of all environmental hazards in enterprises
The natural complex of the city is polluted, and almost natural self-purification from oxygen is a cabs, so without it cannot live a city that needs large adjacent natural areas
This stressful state of the natural environment is harmful to humans [415 b
The main objective of EIA is to identify the environmental and other consequences of the proposed economic activity, develop instructions on environmental recovery to prevent environmental depletion
The State Public Utility Company (SCCP) is divided into exposition scientific, administrative, economic and public departments "Almaty Zoological Park"
There is also a section of the zoo's suburban subsidiary farm for keeping farm animals - Safari Park
Almaty Zoo is one of the largest and leading zoos, and also ranks first in the cultivation of rare birds of prey
The main activity: preservation of the gene pool of wild animals in artificial conditions and reproduction of feeding of domestic and foreign animals, especially rare endangered species of great scientific and cultural and educational significance
It creates conditions for the gene pool of wild animals of domestic and foreign animals (especially rare endangered species)
This article shows the results of preliminary water assessment of Almaty Zoo
The city zoo is located in the center of two rivers: the Cossack River flows from the western side, and the Solonovka River from the eastern side
Water is one of the most important and vulnerable components of the environment
The main threat of global hunger - surface and groundwater - is flooded
pollution of sources and non-scarcity of water resources
Water quality is a common problem not only for all regions of Kazakhstan, but also for the whole world
Steady increase in population and the steady size of available water resources will deepen deficiency of quality drinking water [5,155 b]
It borders with the animal protection zone at a distance of 40-35 m with the western side of the Kazachka River
Individual residential buildings are located between the Cossack River and the zoo
70-80 m from the eastern border of the zoo flows the river Solonovka
Individual residential buildings are also located between the Solonovka River and the zoo
The zoo has three reservoirs - ponds for floating birds:
2 - summer cocycases and algae (cormorants);
non-freezing central pond, withstanding low temperatures, designed for the winter season of waterfowl
The central pond located on the right is provided with water from the borehole in the zoo area
The water system of the central pond organs is organized without freezing in winter due to the supply of sewage from wells
Through the sewage system filled with the upper reservoir, the harvesting of the lower reservoirs passes through the ground reeds
Treated water is sent to tree landscaping zones for watering shrubs and grass meadows
Since independence, the area of the park has decreased significantly by 22 hectares in 2006 and today is only 21 hectares.
Currently, the zoo is being implemented through the culture department of Almaty Mayor's Office
Financing of the zoo is carried out by Almaty Mayor's Office at the expense of funds allocated from the national budget
Kazakhstanis have opportunities for additional financing in Almaty Zoo, installing benches and devoting them to themselves or loved ones
Such events cost 28 thousand tenge, rent wooden benches - 19 thousand iron plates - 9 thousand tenge
It is necessary to conclude a contract for one year and pay money for the benefit of chairs of your name in the zoo
Thus, the zoo management plans to interest citizens to become part of the zoo and improve the territory
Along with these innovations, Kazakhstanis have the opportunity to take care of zoo residents
In the program of guardianship "My kind and kind beast" can participate both physical and legal persons
The contribution depends on the selected beast
For example, the most expensive resident of the zoo - an elephant - costs 400 thousand tenge
You can also get overhaul (100 thousand tenge), stainless (110 thousand tenge) deer (40 thousand tenge), kokikaz (75 thousand tenge) (80 thousand tenge)
The guardian has the opportunity to observe the place of residence of his ward, participating in the feeding process
Money is allocated not only for its maintenance or improvement of the place of residence, but also for the purchase of it
Zoo revenues depend on the influx of people
But in recent periods, the number of visitors has decreased
The care program is designed to realize responsibility for animals under the care of our citizens who love animals and develop their social activity and responsibility
Domestic wastewater discharge is carried out through the city sewage system
No extraction to open water bodies of the plant and for discharge of sewage for water supply from surface sources, except for water bodies of waterfowl
Reservoirs - provided by the use of dug well water on the territory of the pond reservoir
Central water intake system is organized due to well wastewater in such a way that it does not freeze in winter
Through the sewage system filled with the upper reservoir, the harvesting of the lower reservoirs passes through the ground reeds
Treated water is sent to tree landscaping zones for watering shrubs and grass meadows
Water from production wells is also used if the water of the central pond, cleaned in the summer season, does not reach the watering of lawns and hard coatings
Special permits for groundwater use
Filling pools and aquariums for floor washing by workers and engineering and technical workers (ITR) for household (sanitary and drinking) needs at enterprises of urban water networks is used to prepare food for animals of inhabitants of drinking water
Provision of domestic and fire protection needs
economic management of GKP "Bastau" in connection with concluded agreements with existing urban water networks
GKP on the right of economic management of Almaty city akimat "Almaty Water Holding" and ENPF "Tospa su" of Almaty city akimat "Almaty Su Holding"
Domestic sewage is drained into urban sewage networks
Sewage treatment is not provided
Waste water of surface sediments, except for surface flows of car parks, and waste water dumped from the roof of buildings, is released through the terrain of green spaces of their own terrain
The surface wastewater of the parking lot on the square where the administrative building is located flows through the planned territory into the roadway of Ormanova Street
The surface wastewater of the parking lot, located on the area of ​ ​ household yards, falls into the well for collecting and cleaning framed by stones
Car parks located on the area of ​ ​ household yards have a system for cleaning and treating waste water of surface and storm water
The well presented in the treatment facilities is divided into two sections
In the first section there is a filter through a sump and a wooden sprinkler, in the second section there is a set of treated water
Surface wastewater treatment is adopted according to the following scheme: surface wastewater flows from the parking area into recoveries
Melted surface wastewater is used for irrigation of paved water bodies
Museum of Cultural Heritage tourist cluster Protected archaeology monument to local history
Natural museums are a sanctuary reminiscent of great historical events and historical personalities of the Kazakh people
The meeting place of such museums is the terrestrial genre Zhetysu
In the Zhetysu region, under the protection of the state are 1,519 monuments of history and culture of real estate of local importance
Of these, archaeological - 1250 urban planning and beam - 262 natural monuments-7
Currently, this heritage is the main fund of the State Museum KRORTalyk
Currently, the activities of the museum as a public institute meet socio-economic conditions
Today, everyone knows that natural museums have become an international center for cultural tourism
Altyn-Emel National Park in the tract Belgaly Aksu-Zhabagaly in Zhambyl district
Open-air museums consist of a thousand historical monuments of different eras
Among them are petroglyphs and sacrifices of burial grounds
Of these, petroglyphs are the most in demand and outnumber others - Marking-Tas has been included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List since 2004 [1-2 b
Over the past half century, dozens of scientific expeditions have remained here, as a result of each study, archaeologists have witnessed new discoveries of the ancient life of people
So, this reserve is an archaeological complex consisting of hundreds of various monuments covering 3,800 hectares, where inscriptions on the stones of the corpses of settlements are found, covering the period from the XIV-XIII centuries BC to the XIX-XX centuries (a total of 5,000 images) and cultural structures (sacrifices)
It is known that for many millennia cattle were kept here, since warehouses from stone scrap products from metals and bone crowns specially designed for animals were discovered there [3 b
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of field expedition research institutes
Among the monuments on Markal-Kamen, inscriptions occupy a special place
Most of the images on the stone do not show inscriptions showing people grouped, depicted with stones or paint applied with metal crowns
Autumn fine art remained from our ancestors in such historical periods as the era of middle bronze in the transition period of late bronze (the era of early Saka) the era of early iron (the period of Saks and mustache) in the Middle Ages (ancient Turkish) and on this day (Dzungar and Kazakh) periods
Average bronze in more cultural and aesthetic antiquity and clear writing
inscriptions of the era are considered valuable
A distinctive feature of fine art masters of that time is that, for example, sunflower gods covering the skin of a wolf, heroically armed batyrs, sacrifices of people and animals, exotic manifestations are different, as well as various bulls and kulans, camels, wolves and deer
The most distinctive feature of the nature of Marksala-Kamen was the valley of the gorge, where the main inscriptions were located
Acoustic and optical effects are formed on narrow planes surrounded by high lakes
You can talk at a distance of 100-150 meters without raising a loud voice
The more even surfaces of the gorge have been covered with sand oxide for many millennia
For many nationalities who left their mark in the history of Kazakhstan for centuries, the gorges and narrow tracts of Marxala-Tasta remained not lost in their values ​ ​ according to the spirit of their ancestors and the worship of the deity
I am glad that such natural value in our country is of special importance
However, what is the current state of such a natural museum? - arises involuntarily [4 b
Recently, the Stone Gorge with symbols has become a favorite resting place for Almaty residents and guests
Unfortunately, because of this, household waste is overflowing here
In this regard, in recent years, actions and services of the eco-patrol have been organized in the republic
One of these actions - KazTAG - was cleared of domestic garbage on the Ili River, the press service of the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) reported [5 b
The goal of the action is to contribute to improving the ecological culture of society, understanding the responsibility of people for the environment, as well as protecting the exclusive nature of the EDB member states
Slogan: "Quiet - get out after yourself!"
Numerous archaeological sites and huge unique finds located throughout Kazakhstan have become the cultural and scientific heritage of our people
But how many known archaeological sites have not yet been studied, and not revealed underground? At the same time, despite the fact that archaeological sites have not been explored and have not yet been discovered, it is safe to say that each of them is the missing information for the state and science and is a very important part of the country's cultural heritage
The system of legal regulation of relations in the sphere of state protection and popularization of the study of the preservation of objects of historical and cultural heritage of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which takes care of historical and cultural heritage, preserves historical and cultural relics of the state, history and culture [6-7
In conclusion, environmental measures can give an appropriate result only when the efforts of all countries are combined to protect the modern state of specially protected natural museums on the land of Zhetysu
Another measure aimed at improving the relationship between man and nature is the use of natural resources in certain quantities
The formation of ecological consciousness of the population consists of a number of issues of environmental education and education
They-ecological scientific consciousness needs to form environmental ethics, environmental psychology and environmental legal consciousness

Caspian ecology Water pollution of petroleum products
The beautiful nature of the Caspian coast is threatened by its ecological state pollution of the water of the soil cover of the atmosphere
Pollution of the atmosphere is affected by oil and gas producers and processors
Spills of oil and sewage into the ground and soil during the processing of oil products at oil fields pollute them
The area of ​ ​ the North Caspian coast, contaminated with waste oil products, covers 194 thousand hectares, the amount of spilled oil is 1mn
Due to sea level rise and oil spill at sea, it was found that the content of oil residues in seawater is several times higher than the permissible threshold for the content of nitrogen heavy metals with ammonium of phenolic chloride organic pesticides
The maximum concentration of petroleum products in water is observed in May-July
Pollution of the sea coast by oil and petroleum products by poisonous gases leads to mass death of animals and plants living in planktons and marine waters [264 b]
Purpose of the work: monitoring the environmental situation of the Caspian Sea and treatment of wastewater with petroleum products
Job:
Monitoring of Caspian pollution;
treatment of waste water with oil and oil products;
Object of study
Pollution of the Caspian coastal zone poses a great danger not only to the organisms living in it, but also to the health of local residents
Pollution of seaweed by petroleum products harms benthic viable organisms and mollusks, as well as aquatic birds and fish
For example, compared to the last century, fishing in the Caspian decreased by 3 times - from 500-600 thousand tons to 180 thousand tons
One of the most dangerous pollutants of seawater is insoluble heavy metals (zinc barium)
Copper and zinc in water
20 μg/l (2 times the permissible threshold), and barry - 50 μg/l (this is 5 times more)
Water pollution from petroleum products has increased since 1980
Increased heavy metal content in water reduced valuable fish such as sturgeons
Destroys living organisms in oil water by hiding the surface layer of water in a storm
Petroleum products affect phytobentos phytoplankton and blue-green algae
Only 1 ton of oil covers 12 km of water
The exchange of energy between oil air and water covering the seas and the ocean changes physicochemical processes, when heat gas can spoil humidity, water surface temperature rises or fish goes away, or oil falling to the bottom harms living organisms
Oil pollution affects biological equalities: stain reduces the spread of insoluble oxygen in water
Toxic oil substances harm the quality of marine meat from the death of fish aquatic poultry
Increase in oil concentration leads to oil poisoning, at a concentration of more than 1 mg/m, oil toxicity increases
With oil concentration, products flying in water are reduced with the help of solvent acid
It is known that oil penetrates into the deep sea with access to the surface of water
In 3 weeks, 1 mm of oil will drop to 80 meters
Oil products contaminate the bottom of water, and 1-5 mm of oil freely flow
They especially harm birds in the water
As a result, birds die, losing wings in the water and heat generation
Known for diseases caused by this oil
Malignant neoplasm In the northern zone of Kazakhstan, 2-4 times more than in the whole republic, it is harmful to produce oil in the form of an open fountain and with a spill of oil products [327 b]
There are factors for the oil treatment of the surface layer of water: due to the viscosity of oil, it is difficult to deprive it of water, the movement of oil spots under the influence of abundant winds with a large number of areas - hydrometerological conditions and t.
All this will lead to economic and environmental improvement
Today, there is little information about the amount and chemicals in which the Caspian Sea was poisoned
Toxic substances cannot provide accurate determination of anthropogenic and biogenic pollution
20 drilling places flooded in Atyrau region
This will pose a threat of marine pollution
There are 150 drilling places in seawater
Including 120 pipes faulty and not insured for underfilling of oil at sea
Pipes unprotected from ice collapse in Mangystau in winter
Because of the transport of the Caspian Sea, 45 drilling places are already in a dangerous state
Oil pollution will negatively affect the swampy area in the Southern Territory of the Caspian Sea
Caspian pollution from similar situation in Azerbaijan Republic
Methods and results of the study
The main cause of pollution of the Caspian Sea is oil production
However, the misuse of natural resources with low technology creates environmental problems
Oil fields of Kazakhstan in West Kazakhstan Atyrau and Mangistau regions
located
These territories are among the zones that harm the oil industry
The air basin of these lands is polluted by two different routes (natural and anthropogenic)
Also, in water resources, oil is contaminated by waste water from petrochemical industries
Waste water treatment methods are divided into four groups:
mechanical; physicochemical (adsorption absorption electrochemical); biological;
Oil traps with concentration of not more than 100 mg/l are used for treatment of waste water with oil and oil products
These devices consist of a rectangular tank where the process of oil extraction from water due to density is carried out
Oil and petroleum products float to the surface, where they are collected and sent into operation from an oil trap [432b]
Chemical pollution currently poses a particular risk of contamination by oil from its products, including those related only to the transportation and processing of these energy sources
The overall risk of contamination has to be considered for oil pollution treatment
In oil disasters, water causes tremendous damage to air pollution
Living organisms that pollute and consume wastewater suffer from various diseases
Recently, much attention has been paid to the microbiological method
The absolute advantage of this method is the economical environmental safety technological inclination and secondary pollution
Sediments include the use of gels of various substances in the treatment process, the procedure for treating waste water is given in Table 1
Wastewater treatment methods
Gel tumor ability depends on the ability to interact effectively between gel cells
It is possible to change the state of the gel to macrodeng due to competition of tension and attraction
This makes it possible to manipulate the state of the hydrogel system
Manipulation is carried out as follows: various functional groups are introduced into the hydrogel composition, each of the groups has the property
Depending on the use of the hydrogel in a certain direction, the necessary functional group (basic acid alcohol and t) is introduced into its composition.
The introduction of these groups will allow the use of hydrogels in various fields: medical pharmaceutical refining, waste water treatment from petroleum products, crop production of biotechnology and t.
According to the results of the study of the physical and chemical properties of hydrogels, the suitability of hydrogels for treatment from waste water is given in Table 2 [570 b
Degree of waste water treatment from fuel in the volume of various hydrogels
However, it is necessary to know which functional group should be included in the hydrogel for waste water treatment from petroleum products
For example, according to the above results, the acrylamide-based hydrogel is washed less than other hydrogels and contains only one functional group.
As a result of the study, hydrogels can be purified from petroleum products, as well as widely used in medicine in pharmaceuticals in biotechnology as non-toxic and technological materials.
These hydrogels have a number of features, for example, high adsorption capacity does not contaminate organic waste that biodiversity water, disturb biological equilibrium, where economic efficiency does not release harmful by-products in the raw materials for the manufacture of the sorbent, as well as in the final decomposition

Computer multimedia test test task assessment scale knowledge control students informatics statistical data program
The use of information and communication technologies in the education system will improve not only learning, but also the monitoring and evaluation of students' knowledge through the introduction of new technologies into the learning process
Knowledge control - the most important part of learning is now the most effective way to organize student knowledge control with a computer test
In generalized references, "computer testing is testing in the form of interviews between the subject and the computer: test tasks are reflected on the monitor, and answers are entered using the keyboard or introductory tool" [1]
There are a number of advantages of computer testing - processing speed and paper saving by a single method of assessing the level of knowledge of students, and disadvantages - avoiding random errors (in the case where the student is not working well with the computer), the inability to correct the error can reduce the result [2]
Multimedia is a special kind of audio-visual information that combines all possible types of object, starting with a symbol in an interactive system
Multimedia technologies - the development of various dental data - a set of technologies (methods and methods) that implement attempts to combine using hardware and software [3]
A task developed in a multimedia environment is close to reality: providing tasks of video audio video and animation tests and replacing animation effects with a school mouse and combining objects
Test features in a multimedia environment than computer versions here [4]
The types of finished software wrappers for creating automated multimedia test tasks are diverse (for example, TestEkEker UniTest System TestView Indigo Konteroor testov)
One of these programs is the latest version of Indigo INDIGO V2
The INDIGO test creation program is a professional device that processes the result of the automation of the test process and can give a wide range of tasks
Process that automates result processing and testing of the IND system
Universal device used by IVR to solve large-scale problems

testing in the organization of olympiads and competitions
The test system is installed on one computer, where the administration works according to the consumer program, and all data is stored, and the tested can conduct testing through the local network or the Internet
If there is an error to change the rating scale at the discretion of the test job compiler in the text file (TXT) and (Word) in the text editor of test job results, issue a notification about the correct answer indicating the test person the result of storing the test results per file, set the test time of the test report and t
there are many parameters

To do this, you can select the required types of test jobs and enter test jobs by performing new test damages
After entering all test jobs, we will enter the test takers by saving the file (Figure 2)
When you pass the test, you must enter data about yourself
The message should include brief information about students (login login)

The program for creating this test can use characters in several languages ​ ​ and in all languages ​ ​ (Unicode)
A clear advantage of multimedia in precise interactivity is to present test information as a tool for monitoring stability and level in a specific knowledge area, familiar with the evaluation of the result and releasing the final information (Figure 3)
When you create an Indigo test using the Documentary Test tool, you can produce a test form (paper test)
This tool is required when passing tests without the help of a computer

The Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Education": "The main task of the education system is to create the necessary conditions for quality education aimed at the development and professional development of national and universal human values ​ ​ based on the achievements of science and practice, the development of creative spiritual and power capabilities of the individual, moral and healthy
the formation of solid foundations of the way of life, enrichment of thinking by creating conditions for the development of individuality "- emphasized in the Message to the people of Kazakhstan" New political course of the state "Strategy" Kazakhstan-2050 "Our youth should skillfully use knowledge and technology in everyday life, acquiring new skills in the development of new sciences and knowledge.
We must create all opportunities for this and provide the most favorable conditions, "stressing that new methods should form a young generation with knowledge of information technologies [12]
In order to implement the stated tasks, changes were made to the new curricula of the Chemical and Chemical Technological Faculty of KazNU named after al-Farabi
In this regard, the proposed curriculum of the elective discipline "Chemical Process Energy" for students of the 3rd year of the specialty 5B0720000 - "Chemical technologies of inorganic substances"
Students will study the main subject "Physical Chemistry" and get acquainted with the main concepts of the subject
The main goal of elective discipline is to master some concepts that do not provide for the replenishment of knowledge in the subjects of pre-props
Also get acquainted with new concepts and get the opportunity to work with tools and tools necessary for laboratory work
Based on the implementation of such tasks, the content of lectures on the subject "Chemical Process Energy," laboratory work and tasks of the student's independent work is systematized below.
Students learn the subject by using okyitushying for 15 weeks
Content of lectures on the subject "Chemical Process Energy"
In this table, the content of lectures on the subject "Chemical Process Energy," divided into 15 weeks, is divided into 3 modules, which are the competencies of the subject
4-5 lectures on dedicated 3 modules
Content of laboratory works used in the discipline "Chemical Process Energy"
Experimental determination of the heat capacity of the substance of experimental thermodynamics based on modules, the content of laboratory classes of which is subject competence, is systematized
Content of laboratory works used in the discipline "Chemical Process Energy"
According to the new basic curriculum, lectures and concepts that deepen the content of the subject outside laboratory classes, exercises and reports will be presented to the student's independent work.
The independent work of the student according to the academic plan is carried out as a separate task of the student outside the audience at 7 weeks 15 weeks
Self-work of the student is rated according to the rating scale
So, when compiling the content of the subject "Chemical Process Energy," the laboratory works necessary for the subject of the lecture and the possibility of mastering the subject by a student with the systematization of the student's independent work were determined

Training activities of the training process of remote fire technology test test tasks
Head of State N.
Nazarbayev in the strategy of "Қazaқstan-2050" said: "To become a competitive developed country, we must become a highly qualified country
We will need to modernize teaching methods and actively develop online education systems with the creation of regional school centers, "he said, drawing attention to the fact that along with the introduction of a distance learning system in special technical educational institutions and universities in modern schools, it is necessary to pay special attention to its implementation at its level [1]
According to the rules for the organization of the educational process on remote learning technologies, it implies compliance with specific rules for organizing the educational activities of students [2]:
the practical direction of stimulating learning and the possibility of applying knowledge and skills to specific professional activities;
Repeated validation of knowledge for skills and skills;
shaping the transition from visual practices in reading the course to problem research;
availability of a standard for assessing the educational process of the student, presented to the teacher and the student;
preservation of modularity in course preparation, possibility of variation of volume of headings and educational material;
creation of final products on the subject of specialty discipline
Compliance with these rules is a time-consuming process and imposes high requirements on the organization of the control process of trainees
Row E
Balykbaev, etc.
scientific papers of scientists say that in order to monitor the educational activity of students in the training system, the following possibilities must be taken into account [3-5]:
Match the purpose and content of the training
The more complex the material studied, the more complex forms of control should be applied, and an obvious example is that other types of control need to be applied, for example, online interviews with an abstract teacher, teleconference, etc.
compliance with applied pedagogical technologies (if the project method is based on distance learning, then the presentation of the description of the completed project as a control form
The use of orders is permitted; if it is individual training, a test abstract or reporting may be used as a form of control
duration of control activities (the less time a student spends in front of a computer on the Internet, the more efficient it is from an economic and ergonomic point of view);
Speed (the faster the teacher receives the answer from the student and vice versa, the more effective the learning process does when the student quickly answers the teacher's questions);
accessibility (selection of hardware, software and communication facilities and their compliance);
availability of feedback (after the control event, the student should receive a teacher's response with assessments and explanations);
correctness (the teacher must know who actually performed the control work) the availability of protection against falsehood of the result);
ease of preparation of control tasks (time spent on technical operations for preparation of justified tasks)
In remote computer science training that meets such requirements, test tasks, that is, a set of questions and tasks created by a standard of correct answers with a certain evaluation system at a particular level, can be used as one of the effective tools for conducting the control process.
The optimal application of test tasks in the control and evaluation of knowledge is confirmed by their positive effects, i.e. the cost-effectiveness of time when checking the coverage of a significant part of the learned educational material by the test control system, the simplicity of obtaining results and the objectivity of the assessment
When conducting control on the subject "Informatics," the test will be optimal for checking the understanding of the topic for each content network and for informatics
Avanesov stressed that the manufacturers of test tasks should adhere to the following substantive requirements:
the test must meet the test objectives;
Determines the importance of knowledge tested in the overall system of education tested;
The content and shape of the test must be interconnected;
Test tasks must be correct according to the content
The content of the test must be clear about the content of the object;
the test should correspond to the modern level of science;
The content of the test shall be comprehensive and balanced;
test content should be not only systemic, but also variable
He also recalled that when compiling test tasks, it is necessary to take into account the following technological requirements:
when preparing a test, it is necessary to think through individual test tasks and the degree of their complexity in general
usually questions are arranged according to the increasing level of complexity
Test tasks create more medium-complexity questions
when selecting tasks, take into account the general level of students being tested
For example, difficult test tasks when conducting testing for groups with impaired preparation "
does not work "because no student can answer these questions
On the contrary, students with strong training will have simple questions "will not work" and t
As the best test, you can consider test tasks containing a wide range of content that cover a deeper level of knowledge
To protect test tasks from falsification, the following actions should be provided:
technical protection
Using various ciphers and encodings to protect the tests themselves from unauthorized use launches test programs only through a password;
protection at an organized level
Establishment of a network of local testing centres (urban district and
These centres should have a formal testing license for trainees in regions that provide organized testing under the supervision of technical consultants and instructors;
psychological protection
Random confounding of response variants with strict observation of response time;
protection at the statistical level
The level of reliability of the obtained protocols is assessed using a special algorithm of one-time data analysis, which allows to identify, especially in the case of systematic forgery
Currently, from some educational sites you can find computer science tests that already work in real time
In this case, the tester can respond to test tasks by direct interview
Such tests can be seen in the list given in Table 1
Description of sites with test jobs
Analyzing such test tasks, we did the following
When compiling a test, the test program tasks should be based on the rules "from simple to difficult"
Each test block belongs to one section of the chapter and is gradually composed of simple tasks
Transition to tasks should be envisaged
Test program consists of several test blocks
If the student makes an error during the task, the program automatically enters the repetition mode of the topic and the student is forced to repeat the theoretical material from the very beginning
Thus, the test program will allow not only to perform the function of controlling the knowledge of students, but also to stimulate their desire for self-education based on repeated repetitions of theoretical courses on the topic, respectively, supplementing those aspects of the knowledge that do not know without the participation of the teacher
In conclusion, the test is very important for the organization of the distance learning process, but cannot be limited to them
They must necessarily be complemented by other forms of knowledge control
This is due to the fact that the tests have their own specifics
On the one hand, they provide an objective assessment of learners' knowledge and enable the integration of new information technology tools to standardize the control process, as well as the quantification of learners' knowledge, and enable the quantification of learner's education progress by comparing results

Keywords, Conceptual foundations of self-working training of credit training technology
In the modern world, a person does a lot using a computer
An algorithm for performing any task is required, that is, a preliminary record of the actions leading to the result
Based on the algorithm, a program is created, that is, the algorithm for solving the report is written in the form in which it is suitable for execution on a computer
This shows that the essence of the process of solving a report using a computer is to create algorithms
The role of traditimization in the life of modern society is determined not only by the technical aspects of its use
An traditimic attitude does not deprive a person of everyday life of ordinary work
In the vast majority of cases, the result of a person's activity depends on how accurately he knows the traditimic meaning of his actions: what to do at every moment; what the action output should be
This applies to some extent to the ability to create and use aldgoritms
The programming languages of the algorithm on the computer can be understood
First, the action of the algorithm is always developed, then it is written in one of these methods
In general, the program text appears in the form in which the fully completed algorithm is described in the programming language until the end
Then this program text is processed by special services called translators, or translated into machine code or executed
Their separation from natural languages - "words," which are understandable to the translator and obey the strict rule of the command (operators) of recording, will be limited
The set of such requirements forms the syntax of the programming language, and each command and other structure of the language - its semantics
If the program recording form is violated, the translator does not understand the operator's duties and reports a syntax error, and a correct entry that does not meet the algorithm required to use the command language leads to a semantic error (it is also called a logical error or runtime error)
The article will discuss the issue of programming training
The objectives of the disciplines that teach programming are to improve the level of training of highly qualified specialists [1 75 b]
The transition to a credit system in high school has significantly changed the situation compared to traditional education
The current work on changing higher education includes preparing students for continuous education, forming their penchant for independent education and being ready to receive another specialty depending on the requirements of hard work
Traditional education has become universal
Traditional education has resulted in education and a certain profession
However, in modern dynamically changing life, knowledge remains not very fast
Therefore, the classical post-secondary system of study includes the promotion of the renewal of individual treatment of students for the purpose of broad education, if necessary, to supplement their knowledge
Formation of national and professional competence of graduates of higher educational institutions as a result of education in accordance with the standards of general education
As you know, due to the introduction of credit technologies in the educational process, the level of students' own work increases, which spends more time than on lecture and practical classes
This applies to the specifics of this system
Thus, the demand for the quality of education is changing dramatically, so to ensure that the requirements are met, it is necessary to use new teaching methods that achieve the main goal - to increase the necessary professional cognitive and communicative competence of the person
Reasons for the need to apply a new methodology related to the introduction of credit training technologies:
reducing the number of lessons in the audience;
increasing the volume of independent work of students and strengthening teaching control;
Increasing complexity and volume of training materials;
the need to reflect interdisciplinary linkages
The reduction in the number of classrooms, including those from the main ones, leads to the need to revise the scheme for the provision of training materials, which allow a significant part of the self-training of stewards
Requires the development and definition of a conceptual framework for reproducing the complexity and scope of training materials
As a result of studying the subject "Data Structure Algorithms and Programming," students should create a structural diagram of various algorithms, depending on the requirement of the report, organize the necessary data structure, create a program in a good style using the capabilities of the language in the chosen programming environment and choose a programming language, be able to qualitatively prepare program documents to correct program launch errors [2 25 b]
When developing a conceptual training model, it is necessary to use the conceptual principles intended for the system overview of the search area and common: target definition - the totality of the system integrity of the decomposition compliance and analysis
Goal Definition Principle
The main goal of teaching the subject "Structure of data algorithms and programming" for students of the specialty "Information Systems" is knowledge of the data types of classification of programming languages ​ ​ of training in the creation of calculation algorithms and the basics of object-oriented programming of Turbo Pascal language operations to test the creation of a program using internal program functions
The most basic requirement for the reporting system is to ensure unity, that is, to consider the requirements for the relevant reports in this area to be closely related to each other in the report analysis under consideration, to study the basics of calculating and running data type programs to test the program [3 203 b
Generalization in discipline teaching covers the process of teaching from all sides: the methodology of teaching and formation of motivation and further - analysis and solution of organizational work of forms of education, determination of the content of the educational subject and compliance of this content with the modern requirements of experience of forms and methods of knowledge control
The principle of unity provides for a close relationship of approaches in the study of the semantic and structural level in the implementation of various aspects of generalized training
This is a system principle that should be kept in mind that all individual parts of the project that will be run separately will be merged into one system
When considering a set of selected principles, the need for integrity and conformity should not be overlooked.
The principle of integrity includes the creation of a knowledge zone for training without internal contradictions
The principle of conformity means the external inconsistency of the taught discipline, that is, the harmonious sequence of relations with subjects included in the curricula
Provided approaches are correct for any systems regardless of content and structure, so they can be applied to the design of training systems
The following principles can be distinguished from the above:
Provide training of higher level specialists in accordance with the chosen purpose of the discipline specialization
Reports on the study of discipline consist of the most important sections with theoretical and practical interest, in particular, in the theoretical part provide for training of the main parties in algorithm theory, and in the practical part - the basics of programming in the most important instrumental programming systems
The content of the subject is determined by their application in modern programming practice in the environment of instrumental programming systems
The depth of study of students in teaching involves solving such issues as the ability to apply their knowledge in various types of data, as well as teaching the most important theoretical and practical algorithms that can be used in the area under consideration, but cannot be implemented as an exact function in the programming system
Provides training for training materials in contact with various aspects of the ability to successfully apply the capabilities of programming systems
When studying the content of an object at all levels, the principles of complexity and decomposition of integrity are necessarily used
System analytical mathematical apparatus and logical modeling methods are widely used
Independent work is planned systematically
In the educational process in the discipline, the use of the design method is provided
Criteria for monitoring and evaluation of knowledge are precisely defined
Audit classes (studying the basics of programming in the theoretical part in the practical part of algorithm theory)
Ensuring independent work of students (necessary educational and methodological materials)
Ensure that learning is closely linked to action [4 251 b
Using the above principles, we can create a conceptual model of the subject "Data Structure and Algorithm Programming," which can be used when teaching students in the specialty "Information Systems"
A conceptual model of training of university students in programming has been developed (Figure 1)
Model "ni | £ chpt ^ £ ^ p training in programming students of missing shooting places"
Figure 1 - Conceptual model of teaching programming for students of higher education institutions
The conceptual basis of the various information processing processes is the algorithm
The ability to automate processes is ensured by the presence of appropriate algorithms
The formal definition of the concept of an algorithm is associated with the introduction of a special mathematical design (Post Turing machine recursive-computational Cher function) [5 111 b
The curriculum, created according to this conceptual model, provides for the creation and programming in modern programming systems of many publicly available algorithms in the content of the subject "Data Structure and Algorithm Programming," which teaches students
Using the analysis of the constructed conceptual model, you can see that the application of conceptual modeling simplifies and allows you to manage the process of preparing educational documents and organizing the educational process

Today, the world pays special attention to e-learning
in the State Program for the Development of Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020: "
The goal of e-learning is to ensure equal access for all participants in the educational process to the best educational resources and technologies
"[1]
Digital Education Resources (eLearning) are the main component of e-learning
Digital educational resources - allow students to confirm knowledge gained through the execution of interactive tasks and control tasks, explaining new materials with multi-media ideas on each topic of school subjects [2]
Therefore, in connection with the introduction of the e-learning system in the organization of secondary education in Kazakhstan, the CBR is being developed in a number of disciplines, but the methodology for using the CBR taking into account the specifics of each discipline has not been studied.
Using CBR in computer science lessons allows the student to better understand the fundamental foundations of informatics, remembering the implemented topics
Therefore, there is a need to create digital educational resources in informatics
Currently, there are a lot of digital educational resources
It cannot be said that everything is available for a computer science teacher
Therefore, for use of network resources
Using the service in school informatics is an important process

Application of information technologies to the current flow yields significant results
Using digital educational resources in any lesson will not only increase the cognitive activity of students, but also work creatively to create a logical system of thinking
The main importance is the application of innovative technologies to the development of a competitive national educational system and the continuity of its opportunities in entering the world educational environment
In conclusion, the service for teachers of disciplines is an open-ended daily developed methodological system, the use of which in lessons allows the teacher to work more actively with creativity
In the learning process, as digital educational resources LearningApps
we can say that the effective use and use of org service gives a significant positive experience
Main words: knowledge of technology bloom taxonomy, application of technology, generalized evaluation of interpretation of translation of physical geography of Kazakhstan practice of endogenous exogenous methods-approaches
No one will object to the claim that the teacher plays a key role in the implementation of the tasks set to date
World studies in the field of education show that teachers with appropriate professional skills and the necessary skills and in-depth explanations of the educational process can qualitatively change the knowledge of young people (Barber & Mourshed 2007)
Methods developed by the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education are being widely adopted to improve the quality of schooling
Legality of the fact that the ways of studying at school or higher educational institutions are constantly changing
In developed countries, emphasis is placed on improving education technologies [1 7 8]
The technology of education, as the technopark in production is updated in a year, also requires constant change in accordance with the requirements of our time
The social and spiritual development of the population of any state depends on the knowledge obtained at school and higher educational institutions
Therefore, in universities there are enough problems how to convey education to students, how to conduct classes
I am worried about the idea of ​ ​ how to convey knowledge to students, because I myself am a teacher of geographical disciplines
Training can also be obtained by traditional classes
This type of education cannot be excluded as ineffective
The lectures are caused by the lack of additional materials in textbooks at one time
At present, due to sufficient resources, it is often better to focus more on practice
In practice, you can also mix lectures
One effective approach to practicing geographical disciplines
Psychologists of the American method of teaching this way of learning Benjamin Bloom
In his book The Taxonomy of Bloom, he developed his theory
1948 Benjamin Bloom and several experts studied the actions in the classroom and the teacher's goals in planning these actions
1956 Blum taxonomy published [2 3]
Tahis - location building order and nomos - law)
The study revealed three priorities: cognitive (cognitive) Affective (emotional) Psychomotor
I think the role of cognition in teaching is a priority
Knowledge here means a clear explanation of what a student needs to do to learn the lesson
Knowledge of cognitive thinking, application of analytical generalization assessment [410]
Answer questions of cognitive thinking to build students' skills about Blum taxanomy
Students can find a solution to a problem on any topic if they know the answers to these six questions
Knowledge also resembles information and data on how to store memory by repeating or recognizing data
Student: Knows (remembers and repeats) the geographical patterns of the terms applied
a) knows the specific facts
a) knows the procedure of work performance b) knows the basic concepts
c) knows the rules
Tasks: What? When? Which one? Where?
The understanding is that if you understand the training material, you can:
Translation - an example of translating educational material from one "language" to another, give drawings with your word in a certain place as precipitation arrives, depending on the specifics of the colors on the map
Interpretation - a summary of the educational material "by its word";
predict the consequences and results of what is happening
Assumption - further development of the conversation on educational materials
Student: a) understands the facts of the rules
a) converts drawings of materials given in words, graphs of diagrams b) changes the material given by the word to geographical concepts
c) describes the consequences of problems that may arise in the future using the data of the transmitted information
Tasks: How? Why? Specify the difference between the links and explain the graph-picture-map
Application means the use of training material in a specific situation and a completely new situation
Here, the rules include the practical application of the concepts of methods, laws, rules, theories
Requires a deeper understanding of the material than the level of learning outcomes
Student: a) applies concepts and rules in the new conditions a) Applies laws and theories in a practical specific situation b) Shows the correctness of the application of the method or order of work
Test a hypothesis that shows several ways to explain the goals of plotting
Analysis: Dividing educational material into components for a clear vision of its structure, for example, the role of communication parts between parts of the geographical envelope in the formation of the whole
That is, along with the feeling of the content of educational material, it is necessary to analyze the internal structure.
Student: a) reveals hidden (invisible) things a) Defines errors and gaps from the development of thought b) Distinguishes between facts and their consequences c) Determines the importance of the facts presented
Task type: What is the structure? What are the consequences? Analyze the reason for the grouping reconciliation
Compiling a whole (result) from the elements of the training material
As a new result, we can call graphic drawings of the work plan of the message (the report word), regulating educational materials in a completely different way
Such learning results require creative actions that create new content and structures
Student: a) Writes a small work (essay) a) Offers his own experimentation plan b) Creatively uses his knowledge to solve a problem
Task type: find your solution and create an alternative, create it from parts.
The assessment is to determine the value of the training material.
This level implies the achievement of the training results of previous categories
Student: a) Evaluates the logic of the structure of educational material in writing a) Determines the importance of educational material based on internal or external criteria b) Determines the compliance of concluded decisions and conclusions with transmitted facts

A distinctive feature of educational tourism is the training of professional specialists in the field of education
Environmental phenomenon Tourism market State regulation of tourism by tourist administrations Law on tourism authorized body tourism activity
Improvement of the system of state regulation of tourism in Kazakhstan will require new approaches to the changed social and economic agreements that best meet the goals and objectives of the services implemented in the tourism sector
The role of the state in regulating relations between the executive authorities and organizations operating today in the field of tourism should be strengthened
The development of world tourism is becoming the need of society for its socio-economic cultural and environmental phenomenon - the most pressing issues remain the effective management and regulation of the tourism services market
Currently, three main models of management and regulation of the tourism services market at the state level have been formed in world practice.
The first provides for the absence of central state stability, and all issues are resolved on the ground on the basis of market legislation
The main example is the US experience
Elimination of the state structure governing the development and functioning of tourism in 1997
for a number of reasons
Among them, budget cuts include a steady US route on the international tourist market for foreign tourists, the reliability and attractiveness of the country, as well as the presence of individual tourism producers who can perform independent actions, protecting the interests of the entire national market
The second model provides for a strong and active ministry that can assume the main control over the tourism market
This model is widespread in a number of countries where this type of market has recently been successfully developing (Turkey Tunisia Egypt, etc.
Judging by the results, this model is quite effective, but for its further implementation large financial investments are needed, and in the absence of a quick return on investments in Russia, the correct use of this model is considered incorrect
The third model of state regulation of the tourism market provides that tourism is qualified by a multidisciplinary ministry at the level of central executive authorities
In Western Europe, there is often a ministry with "economic trends" and, in turn, is an indirect sign that tourism in these countries becomes the most important component of the economy
The basis of such a model of state regulation is the actual division of tourist administrations into two links
Such a link, which can sometimes be called "bureaucratic," deals with global issues of public administration: the normativtіk-қү_қyқtіқ base for tourism is international cooperation at the international state level, regulation of activities in the region of statistical information management.
Second generation - "marketing"
Most often, this is a department that enters or reports to the main turbulence
His powers include everything necessary for the formation of the country's authority abroad: marketing and participation in advertising exhibitions, management of tourist missions abroad
Here it is these institutions that receive the bulk of state funding: more specialists are concentrated here than basic cash and the "bureaucratic" link
Some countries are trying to turn these "marketing" departments into translucent ones through the commercialization of advertising and information services
But in this case we are only talking about raising additional funds [2]
In this model, the state tourism administration should interact with local authorities and private business
This situation will lead to the role of the central executive in the economic process and a decrease in public spending
Due to this situation, related state institutions may arise in the field of regulation of tourism activities
Their main goal is to find forms of mutually beneficial cooperation between government bodies of various levels of attracting funds from the private sector for the implementation of state tasks
Improvement of the system of state regulation of tourism in Kazakhstan will require new approaches to the changed social and economic agreements that best meet the goals and objectives of the services implemented in the tourism sector
Today, the role of the State in regulating relations between the executive branch and organizations operating in the field of tourism needs to be strengthened [3]
The Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Tourism Activities reflects priority areas of the objectives of the principles of state regulation of tourism activities
The main principles of State regulation of tourism activities in the Republic of Kazakhstan are:

laying of power transmission lines;
construction of a water supply and sanitation system;
laying or passing and providing satellite communications to the telephone network;
construction and reconstruction of transport routes
First of all, it is necessary to provide communication systems of the beach and health tourism development zone
It is necessary to form territorial zones with recreational specialized farms based on concentration of large recreational resources
At the same time, in order to increase the investment attractiveness of the tourism sector, the following issues need to be resolved:
raising awareness of international business communities about tourism opportunities of Kazakhstan and developing cooperation in this direction with foreign organizations, including through the working group on tourism development in East Kazakhstan region;

- Graduate 5V060900-Zharatylystanu bachelor of KazUPU named after Abay Role of tourism in education of youth
The special role of tourism in pedagogy
The teaching industry plays an important role in the development of tourism
Tourism calls on young people to patriotic education and training in labor
Pedagogy and tourism are interrelated and affect youth as individuals
Pedagogy and tourism invite young people to national education
Tourism issue discussed in President's Address
Thanks to the development of tourism, we will be able to show our country to the whole world
Displaying approximate locations
It is necessary to develop tourism with effective use of attractions in all corners of the country
Tourism is one of the busiest industries in the country in recent years
This industry is becoming the most profitable for our economy
However, the number of tourists traveling outside the country prevails over vacationers inside the country
They explain this by the fact that the hotel in our country is not inferior in price to tourist services
Pedagogical educational tourism activity Labour development at the national educational patriotic education of youth
Keywords: virtual type of virtual tourism human factor of information tools image of tourism marketing tourism advertising tourism industry panoramic photos state project tourism resources "Wanaway"
Our existence in the era of information technology development contributed to the fact that we had many excellent opportunities compared to past centuries
In a short period of time, the effect of virtual culture can be traced in all aspects of modern human life
He also became widely known in the field of tourism
The advent of multimedia systems led to the emergence of the concept of "virtual tourism"
Such a revolution allowed travelers to achieve previously unfamiliar opportunities
If in past times tourist dreams remained unfulfilled, today it is enough to go to the Internet to achieve a dream
For people who are even sick or do not have free time, who cannot quit work at home for people with disabilities, today it is not difficult to travel to another country
To do this, just choose the right place only on the Internet
Virtual tours with photos and audio discs will help you travel to these places
In such species, the mouse is the vehicle
Virtualization really gives a person unlimited opportunities
You can surprise the Eiffel Tower, dreaming of one or two mouse clicks, through the streets of Foggy Albion or from the strange ideas of Stockholm for a walk along Elesa Square
People around us who make noise help to make sincere feelings [1]
So modern technologies have brought virtual tourism to real tourism as much as possible: in a few minutes it was possible to see several cities and countries
Of course, no matter how close they are to reality, such tours cannot take the place of ordinary travel
However, for many people with disabilities, being able to travel for people with disabilities is a disappointing solution for doing the right marketing for many tourism businesses
Therefore, virtual tourism is better considered as a separate sphere [2]
The most important thing is that the virtual view is a marketing spectacular tool for rendering a product or service to the consumer from a special point of view
She told her consumer:
leaves the impression that he is walking there; bright commemorative sculptures;
allows you to get maximum information about an item or service [3]
Many tourism companies do not use this type of advertising, although they know that virtual tourism is beneficial for showing places with high tourist potential of the country
Our country pays great attention to solving this problem and its interest in the innovation of this concept!
A virtual view is a marketing tool designed to provide a consumer with a product or service from a special point of view
He impressed the viewer that he is there, and vivid memorable sculptures also allow you to get more information about the product or service
In the world, a virtual tour occupies 35% of tourism
The process of changing time and development of computer technologies is developing a virtual world every day [4]
Despite the high prospects for the development of virtual tourism in the country, the number of enterprises using it cannot be filled.
But Kazakhstan provides for the goal of developing the tourism industry as a whole
And since the concept of virtual tourism is currently amazing for our country, it is possible that in the future it will be reflected in the stage of development
Adding on virtual tourism is an unusual approach for the above issues
Create a virtual tour
Provision and application of modern technologies
How to advertise
j	Raise your image
Figure 1
Virtual Tourism Image Raising Marketing Tool [Note: Designed with Author]
To build virtual tours according to Figure 1 above, you must be provided with the fully necessary technologies
Equipped technologies will create special virtual tours, that is, the product
This product is for simple consumers only
On the other hand, it is a marketing tool
This will be used as an ad
Because it leaves a pleasant impression of simple processed photos and videos
Helps you get more information than they do
And in this case, the question of improving the image according to the third scheme arises
To increase the image, PR was used in the marketing system, that is, advertising
Advertising plays an important role in the image issue
If you look at this, then we will see that in order to form a common image in the country it is necessary to create a virtual view
At the same time, it can be considered a necessary approach not only in the formation of an image, but also in the plan of conducting advertising actions
Despite sufficient resources in the country, activities on them have been slow
Therefore, we cannot talk about the opportunities for the development of virtual tourism
Even in large foreign countries with dynamically developed virtual tourism is already used
It was not possible to establish accurate data on companies engaged in virtual tourism in the market of Kazakhstan
The main reason is that such statistics have not yet been made
And now that we begin to work in the market of our country, no special importance is attached to
In general, virtual tours include the number of companies creating panoramic photos and the number of companies creating sites
Because any site development company is creating virtual tours as an additional source of revenue
But this type of tourism can be called promising and useful
Since virtual tours based on modern information technologies are developing very quickly
Currently, it is not enough only to produce new products in order to take a leading role in world markets
In highly developed times of competition, along with the high quality of production of products and services, it is necessary to properly promote these products on the market
We cannot say that despite the unpopular tourist resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the development of tourism in the country has a high degree.
One of the main reasons for this is correctly selected and incorrectly conducted marketing [5]
When developing a strategy for developing the country's tourism in the world market of tourism services, first of all, we should pay special attention to this issue.
Now you know commercial firms have little opportunity to advertise to foreign consumers
In this regard, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports is working on propaganda in Western countries, where the most tourists come
So, now videos on BBC CNN Euro News are shown in Kazakhstan
It promotes the tourism opportunities of the country
At the same time, I think the role of advertising will be played by the appearance of virtual tours and their installation on special sites
Because the effectiveness of the psychological impact of advertising attracts the attention of potential consumers
determined by the level of attraction and the level of memory of listeners of advertising publication
This can be judged by changes in consumer actions
And it is difficult to really calculate
Do not forget that marketing is a very strong tool to influence the consumer of advertising using advertising [6]
In addition, the organization of tourist information centers in the regions of the republic and abroad plays an important role in the formation of the country's tourist reputation.
Due attention should be paid to using the experience of cooperation between tourism organizations and diplomatic missions of the Republic of Kazakhstan abroad
Effective assistance in advertising the country's tourism potential can be provided by national air carriers and other transport enterprises
It is necessary to produce and actively distribute high-quality printing and audiovisual advertising materials about Kazakhstan abroad
The attraction of tourists to Kazakhstan is influenced by local history publications of advertising and publishing activities, including advertising and publishing activities of tourist companies and hotels
Special attention should be paid to the use of new information technologies, including the creation of web-sites of tourism companies of Kazakhstan in the Internet system
These activities are carried out independently
For example, on the site provided to the state of Great Britain, you can get detailed information about the Republic of Kazakhstan
At the same time, we think that if you do a virtual tour on the site about places such as Lake Kolsai, about monuments of historical and cultural heritage with the diverse nature of Burabaya, then this will affect what beauty and at the same time the reputation of our country [7]
There are moments when virtual tourism in Kazakhstan is not very small, but pleasing
It includes the appearance of the state project "Wanaway," which includes a virtual view of the sights of all of Kazakhstan
The author also presented a new project in the form of a terminal in order to increase the country's virtual tourism potential
Despite the high prospects for the development of virtual tourism in the country, the number of operating enterprises cannot be filled.
The project is presented in order to create a real source of income from virtual tourism or act as a virtual guide for guests of our country
This idea was considered as follows: in large cities of the country, the airport places a virtual service terminal at train stations
The capabilities of these terminals are very high: anyone can visit this terminal and get the necessary information about the places he needs
For this, on the terminal display are the names of the cities
All information will be in three languages: Kazakh Russian and English
By choosing a guest city, the tourist will see on the screen a virtual map of this city [8]
Tourism has not only economic but also socio-cultural significance
Because this will contribute to the development of interstate ties between countries and cultural exchange, which will increase the volume of interregional ties and show the cognitive level of the population
The virtual view, organized in all types of tourism, is informative for its visitors
The very first cave created a virtual view
This is the Shulgan stone cave
Shulgan stone - a state reserve in Bashkortostan, created in 1958
This is a cultural and historical object
There are many myths and legends
There is a special cave in the reserve
The length of the entrance to the cave is 29 kilometers
The cave consists of 3 floors
In the inner cave flows an underground river
In 1959, reserve zoologist A.
Ryumin opened the cave
At the same time, unique drawings from the Paleolithic era were found
Subsequently, in February 2012, free access of travelers to the cave will be closed in order to preserve the nature of this area and due to changes in weather conditions here
But interest has also grown
For this, at the request of the government, a panoramic virtual view of the cave will be created
When you create a virtual view, it is not removed to the end
And this is on display in the museum of the reserve
It is noted that in the country there are many opportunities for creating virtual tours
Because the country is rich in tourist resources and historical monuments [9]
Any tourist company certainly wants to keep customers on its website for as long as possible and not look for another place.
Such capabilities can create virtual tours
Virtual tours create an open day 24 hours a day for your business, which leads to complete customer confidence in your website and leaves its impact on the customer even after you exit the Internet
Conclusion
Today, a new direction of "virtual tourism" has appeared in world tourism
Its capabilities are amazing and unable to communicate information anywhere in the world
Virtual
tourism is a type of tourism associated with the emergence of multimedia systems of new technologies related to the development of society
Underdeveloped tourism is lacking in the country aimed at tourism development
Virtual tourism is the latest innovative advertising technology
Through such tours, any tourist enterprise can improve the reliability of its services by providing the consumer with reliable information about its activities
Be that as it may, domestic tourist institutions do not use this type of marketing tool, considering it a difficult way
Thus, for travel agents or travel companies, virtual tours are mainly advertising activities
Primary organisational service providers for visitors or departing travel firms
Currently, as we see, most consumers choose travel firms over the Internet
Virtual tours will allow users to fully view the company's office without distracting from the computer
Through a virtual tour posted on the company's website, it raises the client's trust and frequency of attention to the travel company [10]
In connection with studies conducted under the influence of the virtual type of tourism of Kazakhstan, the following results can be made:
Establishment of a tourist information centre;
the creation of an information portal reflecting virtual tourism of the country's attractions in the countries supplying tourists to the country;
continuous application of virtual tourism in tourism marketing;
Implementation of virtual guide terminals
the creation of new state-level projects;
increasing the number of virtual tour companies, creating conditions for their successful work by the state
The concept of "virtual tourism" as a whole is a new concept in the consciousness of the population
Therefore, the current state of affairs in our country is extremely unimportant
But the tourist market of the country does not stand still
Therefore, I am sure that we will achieve a big victory in small steps
Site of a non-profit project for creating spherical panoramas "AirPano "//

Local history toponym historical toponym ecological tourism route register
Kazakh citizens have growing interest in knowledge of prospects of economic development of the history of their people, peculiarities and possibilities of the nature of the region
Therefore, in school, the importance of deep education of the native land and education of love for the native land increases
That is, the improvement of local history work at the school is an important pedagogical process
In the program article of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan "Social modernization of Kazakhstan: 20 steps to the Society of Universal Labor":
- in secondary technical and professional higher educational institutions "Fundamentals of individual and social income of Akmeology" "Tsuzigi of Kazakhstan" were instructed to introduce mandatory training courses, such as "Local History" [1]
Changes in education are aimed at enabling students to combine theory with practice
Therefore, the purpose of the subject is to develop the ability to connect the acquired knowledge with experience by getting acquainted with the physical and geographical socio-economic conditions of the native land
Also analyze the origin of historical toponyms of the region
The following tasks arise from this goal:
identification of features of planning and organization of local history works in secondary school;
Preparation of samples of classes and extracurricular works according to the course "Local History";
provision of training models on interdisciplinary local history topics;
Disclosure of the possibility of patriotic education of students of the course "Local History"
Practical importance of the work:
physical and geographical characteristics of Pavlodar region
Work with map (laying of mineral internal waters along terrain of extreme points of region boundary)
Operation with plates (climatogram of wind expression Figure
) be able to
Description of the geographical location of Pavlodar region with familiarization with the names of land-waters
Toponyms should be assessed by historical name
Millions of amphibian names in our broadband area show a vision of population, a vision of vital economic professions.
In this regard, our people had a son, Sh.
Ualikhanov: "Kazakhs who do not violate the sour cream of the ancient Turkic custom, the name of the area-water, associated with historical events covering one sphere of life, with memorable human names and others."
In this case, this casitic and mighty land - a book in which secrets are not revealed - is a very mysterious phrase
All these words are the names facing the people
All these names are a historical monument of centuries-old heritage
In Pavlodar region there are few such historical land and water names
Bayanaula - land filled with nature-specific properties
Dzungar is located at the junction of Alatau and Balkhash with Kokshetau and Genghiz of the Tarbagatai nature
This is a region filled with historical literary religious legends reflecting the ethnographic life of our people
"Goats Korpesh - Bayan Sulu" "Er Edige" "Brown Saint" t
a few legends that have reached us
All this is partially legendary historical reality [2 3]
The course of studying the toponyms of the Bayanaul region is mainly K
Guided by materials collected by Saparov in this area
Along with the ethnolinguistic and cognitive character of toponyms exhibited according to religious beliefs
For example, in relation to Lake Molalykol, in connection with the Auliebulak River, the village of Auliebulak and wintering is inhabited: Muslim Haziret tau stone: Aulietas Kudayshoki on Mount Akbet
It is known that there is a sacred cave "Brown Saint"
This area has become a geographical object for the health of not only local residents, but also sick tourists.
An urgent question is the cognitive nature of the linguistic study of the process of the second nomination of legends-stories about how the names of the area-water in the system of the most interesting and complex names of the tribe of Kazakh onomastics are put forward in this regard.
Therefore, we now consider it important to study these productive groups on the ethnolinguistic cognitive basis of linguistics [4]
Orographic (names characterizing the terrain) and hydrographic (names of water bodies) objects are found in the Ertis-Bayanaula region, where the toponyms "Kalmakkulgan" "Shuritkagan" "Zhalaulyn" "Naiza" are known in other battles, in particular, in these battles.
Bayanaul district - the place where real rampant tourism opens
32 recreation areas created on the territory of Bayanaul State National Natural Park around the lakes Zhasybay Sabyndykol Toraigyr
Five of them belong to industrial facilities
The creation of tourist routes on the territory of the Bayanaul State National Natural Park will allow developing ideology and promising directions of a healthy lifestyle, carrying out work on sports and recreational cultural and educational ecologically local history
Tourists will be offered trainings on environmental tourism and scientific (botanical ornithological etymological) tourism
Of the 11 tourist routes for 696 km, 6 operate today
Of these, 116 km on horseback and 460 km of vehicles and 120 km at pedestrian crossings
The roads of these routes are equipped with stairs and toilets in places of rest
It is planned to open 4 more routes along the route "Dalba" and "Kyzyltau"
From year to year, the tourism sector develops in accordance with the plan
On the territory of the park there is a 28 holiday home, accommodating more than 40 thousand people
There are also 2 holiday homes for children
Excursions organized by tourist companies of Pavlodar city are conducted by park employees
150 thousand people visit Zhasybay recreation area per year [4]
Table 1 - List of tourist routes
In Zhasybay recreation area for twenty years will pass interregional meeting of tourists "Irtysh meridian"
Its organizers were the regional newspaper "Star of the Irtysh" and the regional department for youth tourism and sports of Pavlodarturist JSC
Purpose of the meeting: strengthening of friendly relations between tourists of Russia and Kazakhstan, further development of sports tourism, promotion of environmental management and exchange of sports experience
The Slet program consists of a cross-trip tourist relay and a program that will definitely include a tourist song contest [6]
In analysing the above issues, the following proposals can be made:
systematization of data collection taking into account physical and geographical socio-economic conditions of the region;
Introducing a content-oriented component as a school component or circle;
creation of a list of tourist routes for graduation of students to field practice

Landscape science, steppe practice method landscape map soil map botanical profile profile location levels theodolite
On specialties the geography "5B011600" and "5B060900" at the end of the 2nd course is carried out complex field practice in objects of physical geography
The question of why future teachers of geographical disciplines need field practice is natural
Steppe practice allows you to conduct an examination and combine theory with a practical analysis of the knowledge obtained at a theoretical laboratory and seminar in the audience
Currently, the amount of field practice hours for geographical disciplines has significantly decreased in the study of credit technologies
The question prompting the writing of the article is that it has the importance of practice and how to conduct it, and not increase the number of hours
Since this year, significant changes have been made to the secondary school curriculum
The main problem in the study of modern geographical disciplines is in the first place specialized training in the natural environment of the area
Many examples should be compared with trends in Kazakhstan
At the same time, the topic studied should have a connection and the geographical and natural environment in which the student lives
In this regard, attention is paid to conducting control studies of the environment of students
Field practice certainly provides an opportunity for students to learn closer to the natural environment, which does not pay much attention to everyday life, and a deeper attitude to the origin of emerging trends to investigate its control.
We need a practical teacher who can create such a thought
Such teachers need to be formed while studying at a university
Students whose knowledge theoretically and practically coincides, we can temper complex or special practice not in the volume of the audience
Much that steppe practice gives to the judges
Familiar to them, however, provides an opportunity to familiarize themselves with geographical trends that do not provide a complete understanding.
Studies research methods, analyzes research work and learns to draw conclusions
Students have interest in research search
The question is how to conduct field practice
He elaborated on field practices carried out in his landscape
This practice is carried out at the end of the year by students of the 2nd year at the end of May and in the first week of June
The first students should be familiarized with the meaning and objectives of the practice
In short, we need to answer the question why practice is needed
Study of the connection of the components of the geographical envelope of steppe practice with their spatial location and classification of the natural complex of the terrain (modern state genesis and level of further development) and search for ways to evaluate TBT and protect its effective use
Landscape practice Physical geography Cartography Practice summarizing and summarizing knowledge obtained from Geology and Biogeography Courses based on topography
The main goal is the steppe
study of landscape survey method and assessment of geosystem of investigated lands
At the same time, training in the organization of practice
Main task: study and development of the method of determination of soil vegetation world in profiling mapping of designated lands [1 7 b
When preparing, the teacher, together with students, independently solves the goals and tasks of field practice
The students pre-assemble the cartographic materials and the literature fund of the investigated zone and receive individual and group tasks
The work schedule before reaching the surveyed area shall be decided by the members of the team on economic issues taking into account the terms of work of the required materials.
Types of works to be performed by the ships in the steppe practice:
Landscape survey of the territory (embankment); facation and mapping of the settlement
Survey Landscape Profile
Economic use of studied lands
Landscape and geoecological map of material collection and use of its nature in conditions of modern geosystem
Perform individual tasks
Write Final Report
Materials collected in preparation for practice:
literary and cartographic materials on the surveyed area;
reports of previous studies (geological biological and soil);
drawings and names of the collection of rocks and minerals of this area;
prepare a brief outline of the area under study
The concept is recorded in scientific literature based on data from topographic geomorphological maps of soils and materials of previous studies;
Define the mapping scale and its conditional characteristics
production of aerial photographs and topographic map of the analysed area;
preparation of necessary references and dictionaries;
selection and definition of the topic of field practice for the scientific report;
prepare a history of the geological development of the weather of the studied area with knowledge of the nature of hydrography of the terrain of the soil and vegetation cover of the animal world and animals and plants under protection or listed in the Red Book
Period of field practice:
Main stage of geosystem study
At this stage, the geosystem of the zonal introsonal zone of the area is investigated, conducting comprehensive studies
Main research methods (conducted sequentially):
A simple overview of the nature of the area
Route Landscape Scheme Method
The frequency of routes during unloading depends on the complexity or simplicity of the terrain landscape
In case of difficulties, it is necessary to increase the route
If necessary, make a horizontal route
Basic method
Comprehensive study of the geosystems of the site most important or characteristic of these lands
Carrying out landscape and ecological monitoring by studying these lands effectively and allows to fulfill the main tasks
In the course of field studies, the following works are carried out:
Introduction to the site of the general review
The main factors and trends that form the geosystem of the terrain will determine the most important investigated places of the land plot with the application of a landscape profile
At the same time, in the most difficult place, the teacher actually does work, how to conduct research, together with students
How to control how to remove the herbarium, when compiling geological geobotanical and soil maps, scale selection paths should be taught to managers of ways to use special means [4 24 b
At the first stage, the student's tasks are:
record work in a diary;
filling out of forms of cards and tables;
give a description of the soil slice image
At the second stage, students work in the allocated areas:
General familiarization with the territory provided;
determining the route of the landscape bench;
determining the landing band of the landscape profile;
familiarity with emerging rocks;
determination of hydrological control point;
Identification of river or lake forest names;
determining the level of human exposure;
Determination of the level of economic use
After completing the general review, the team members map the morphological part of the landscapes (land management)
For a comprehensive study, take multiple profile points to your map
Relative height of profile line can be determined by leveling or simple mooring (levels)
Soil moisture in soil soils of geological structure is lowered into the profile
By evening, after completing the study, team members remove today's work card on a blank sheet from the leader
Errors on the part of students should be resolved together with the leader and members of the team
At the same time, the materials collected daily must be processed
These include entries in the students' personal diary, graphic drawings (air temperature under air humidity pressure, water temperature speed and wind direction), selected by profile and herbarium soil samples prepared for drying
At the end of general field practice, each team, at the direction of the manager, must clean up the necessary drawings and records for the report and fill out the desired place before returning to the university
Materials to be performed during the period of cameraldice or expert processing:
landscape map;
complex landscape profile;
tasks (card forms and tables) specially designed for individual geosystems;
data in the geosystem diary;
catalogs compiled during operation with data measured by microclimate indicators of terrain by leveler or theodolite;
forgery and photography;
Expert opinion on the level of anthropogenic impact on the geosystem;
samples of vegetal soils and rocks collected from the studied area;
During this period, the members of the brigade fully communicate and each streamlines the work assigned to them
All card works are first applied to a simple paper and, after checking the manager and making changes, are lowered to a new sheet or watman
When the card is complete, the card text is recorded
Exact data for the text:
a) the scope of control research work, in which the goals and tasks of the time and address of the introductory practice are fulfilled;
a) physical and geographical description of the territory in which the practice was carried out
For example, the Aksai gorge of the Ili Alatau;
b) nature of landscape structures;
c) modern natural and natural-anthropogenic state of the geosystem;
d) recommend restoration of the ecological state of the geosystem in its future; d) conclusion;
d) list of used literature; (e) Supplementary materials [6 7 b]
Accounting of practice is protected by members of the brigade at a time
Each student is evaluated with individual questions
Practice results should be published in scientific journals together with leading students
Building Experience with New Approaches to Learning
This topic has become a game of teachers teaching geography for many years [1 7 10]
School teachers were actively engaged in education and training in their business
Therefore, these two questions will help students through the subject form their consciousness
That is, every professional - teacher - knows that holding it according to plan is the most effective way to date [8]
The content of the lesson includes the right ways of education and learning based on their plans so that its purpose is easily understood by the student
In this regard, currently top specialists: geographers produce geography textbooks for schools of new content
For example, the outstanding scientists-geographers A.
Beisenova K.
Birmagambetov K
Mamirov U
textbooks are published in Kazakh and Russian
In particular, these textbooks are widely used in methodological frameworks filled with a lot of new data, the content of which meets the requirements of today
Since the course of physical geography is one of the stages of primary education of students, its structure is recorded in the easily designed field of the student with adaptation to the features of age [2]
Each theme is based on the approved time budget for its standard school classes
Such a plan suggests that other schoolboy classes do not affect the time budget
In accordance with this case, programs are developed
All of them are aware of the need for meaningful changes in geographical knowledge for the main purpose of the school
Many publications talk about these issues
Biology Geography and Chemistry
Best practices on new programs are held in the magazines "Geography at School"
about research works
Including suggests that with high prices for mastering these lessons, explanatory abilities have not yet been fully formed.
However, when answering questions, they cannot summarize causal relationships with the wording
Insufficient stabilization of knowledge on certain geographical issues
One of the reasons for such shortcomings is the inconsistency of geographical content in the right number of forms of training in methodological changes
The main form of organization of the educational process is occupation
The result of geography training depends on its organization and conduct
Improving the well-being of students by teaching good education forms a tendency to life to prepare for work
Therefore, in the temporary space, work is underway to improve the educational program, therefore, adjusting its content using new methods will teach students to understand quickly
Geography teachers are also looking for ways to reorganize classes in accordance with the requirements of the "Қazaқstan-2050" strategy [6]
Evidence of a lesson in published articles through thematic plans [3 9]
These articles attempt to improve the plans of classes than articles written according to previous programs, which have the goal set for them - educational issues
In addition, in the methods of refinement and repetition of lessons, training work is grouped
But some shortcomings in the organization of geography lessons are manifested in Kazakh schools
All these are errors that occurred when conducting lessons according to previous programs
Methods of combination with a didactic purpose, often taken into account only yesterday and today in terms of the content of lessons, are limited to a house assignment explaining new material with an oral request of the lesson, which passed in one form
One of the difficulties of teachers is that before the beginning of lessons, teachers have problems with the formulation of educational issues
The content of physical geography in the school is very diverse in educational composition
General geographical concepts that need to be understood and remembered in order to receive education must make their own legitimate connections by conducting lessons based on their own experience and the skill of the teacher
Requires the choice of a specific organizational form of cognitive actions of students of various types of knowledge
But in the practice of training, the methods of conducting lessons change ambiguously
Most often, education takes place in informational form; first, the teacher himself explains the new material, and then shows various visual aids
Does not take into account how the student took
Does not check the student's ability to learn when passing the new material
Organizing a teacher of such an educational process really saves time on appearance
Nevertheless, the result of the training does not look as it seems
It is not known that sufficient understanding has received an accurate and comprehensive education
The planning of lessons by one teacher is often incorrect.
Therefore, the educational process will be organized one way or another
Teachers of general education schools include in the plan tasks and questions sent to the house to check knowledge of the content of readable materials
To control the student's ability to understand, the teacher uses a simple form of conversation during the lesson
If the lesson is repeated, checks the learner's understanding
Verification is carried out on each topic
The materials that took place in such repeated classes, instead of one systematization of generalization as a whole, stop with four questions: what? where? when? how much? he said
What is said is not accidental
A questionnaire conducted among teachers states that teachers when repeating a lesson are not limited only to didactic goals and testing students' knowledge
That is, we are talking about the difference between the second lesson and the process of testing the knowledge of students at the end of the school year
So far, little attention has been paid to this situation, it has not been fully studied
There are no fundamental theoretical works in the methodological literature on the declared problem
Studying the specific features of the geography lesson will solve educational issues
This is evidenced by data on the theory of lesson A
Darinsky's work can be called
Of these, the work "Methodology for teaching geography" and the work "Geographical lesson its meaning and structure" "Types of geography lessons" reflect the organization of many geographical classes
Organization of methods for conducting lessons on the selection of materials for classes with analysis of the structure of classes that divide classes into types
Proves different aspects of the method of conducting geography lessons in the publication of many years [4 5]
Special attention is paid to the requirements for conducting a geography lesson
One of the requirements is the presence in the lesson of scientific content of a conditional sign of an educational direction, which should have a conditional sign of an educational direction.
Another thing is how teachers can conduct classes in their work
This line refers to the course methodology, the course methodology does not specify the section on the educational goal of organizational content, designed for the specifics of geography classes
While some teachers ask in their plan the question "the purpose of the lessons," some do not ask this question
The Enhanced Geography Program helps its methodological apparatus to choose the content of the synthesis of lessons of interdisciplinary relationships with tools that contribute to the improvement of the lesson process
The organization of classes will be associated with the teacher in the course of physical geography, being part of the educational process
Contradictions between the content of geography in programs and the conditions for its implementation create a problem of improving the organization of classes
The geography methodology has been theoretically proven in the future and according to the experiment there are no correct answers to the following questions:
a) in the subject of geography, what are the plans that successfully solve the teacher's educational goal; What is the form and content of which relationships depend on the function performed by such plans;
a) which classes are suitable for school geography for a didactic purpose; what plans should be drawn up if it takes into account its specific content and the ability to read and understand the characteristics of the youth of students;
b) what are the peculiarities of the structure of occupations of each type, depending on the content of the geography course and the educational goal
Thus, the problem of lessons becomes multilateral [2-4]
It includes issues of new materials, chosen for classes, basics and the allocation of additional materials; which method to choose the necessary means for classes; how to test students' knowledge and register them for consideration again of aspects of individual work with them
Thus, in order to effectively manage the educational process, the teacher needs a program for geography classes with educational and educational goals
The role of such a programme is played by the curriculum [5-8]
The main node of improving the educational process in the subject of geography is the teacher's promotion to a high stage of improving the plan of his geography
To do this, a significant plan needs to be modified so that the plan includes innovations in the organization of its implementation [1-10]
The article is devoted to the primary issues of the pedagogical basis of planned classes on the initial course of physical geography [5 7-10]

Major categories of global global problems of globalism Geographical globalism trends in globalization, depletion of anthropogenic resources, geographical unity of humanity
Global problems reflecting the social and natural processes on Earth's planet explore a special area of ​ ​ knowledge - globalism
Global human problems are now becoming an important form of interdisciplinary research
Depending on the complex nature of global problems, they are explored by certain branches of the natural social and technical sciences
In the second half of the 20th century, a new field of science was formed - global geography or geographical globalism, which studies global problems
Scientists have defined globalism as an interdisciplinary field of scientific research aimed at determining the factors of globalization both the trends in the development of its causes and its positive and negative consequences [1]
Globalism as a separate scientific direction and sphere of social experience, formed in the 60s of the XX century due to the need to solve complex problems of a planetary scale before various branches of science, with the subsequent expansion of the scope of the identified problems in the society-nature system, began to pay attention to the scientific community, called "modern global problems"
Thus, the term globalism was assigned in the special literature
And its content was talked about only after the fall of the socialist system and changes in the geopolitical map in the second half of the 1990s, when scientists began to pay attention to the process of globalization
Before defining the main categories of globalism and their relationship, first
"Globalization," "global challenges," "globalism," "geographical globalism"
Globalization - integration and unification of the world's economic, political, cultural and religious processes
Globalization is a centuries-old natural-historical process, global problems are the legitimate result of this process
Globalization:
historically, one stage of development (capitalist);
in economic terms - a change in the structure of the world economy, the emergence of a market economy;
politically - the proliferation of democratic organizations;
cultural - cultural exchange between the society of mankind;
geographically - a set of global problems accompanied by natural economic and social processes
Economic interests and trade have become the basis of a new economic globalization
It unfolds from Europe and responds to the whole world
International financial institutions opened in the economy and transnational corporations emerged
Global problems are caused by the uneven development of various spheres of modern human life and socio-economic political, ideological socio-natural and other human relations
Global issues have characteristics (Figure 1) [2 3]
Addressing global challenges	1

All		countries	peoples and peoples		require merger	does
Figure 1 - Main features of global problems
Globalism is the theoretical and practical sphere of globalization and global problems
The etymological origin of the word "globalism" in Latin means "globe" - the universe, that is, a system of knowledge about global problems corresponding to planet Earth
Globalism Interdisciplinary form of natural-scientific and social-humanitarian fields of education
"Globalism" - a set of scientific philosophical cultural and applied research, from which the results are carried out in the economic social and political spheres at the state and international level [4]
Geographic Globalism - Challenges in Natural Economic and Social Processes
physical geography: pollution of the environment - water and soil air - space and ocean exploration address the problems of depletion of resources, with which the interaction of nature and society is not restored
overcoming economic underdevelopment, reducing the problems of increasing energy demographic food shortages
social geography: elimination of the creation of means of mass destruction for the preservation of peace
includes
Globalism philosophy policy history includes processes in the field of social culture economy and geography
For example, political globalism examines globalization from a political perspective
A feature of political globalism is that science not only characterizes global problems, but also uses nuclear food energy
provides tools and methods to address global challenges
The methodological basis of political globalism is made up of civilizational or socio-cultural methods. The task of political globalism is to prepare and determine an alternative to the future led by humanity.
Political globalism in a civilized approach views globalization in historical dynamics
One of its most important issues is the conclusion of a dialogue of civilizations, in which a comparative analysis of the ways of globalization to the political strategy of interreligious interaction to the main socio-cultural values ​ ​ of world civilization will be conducted
New issues shaping global political time and space, some deviations in the process of globalization will also be studied
According to scientists, geographically globalists aspire to the diversity of globalism:
linking the vast majority of global problems to geography;
geography studies the patterns of spatial distribution of any phenomena as socio-ecological economic and
The impact of processes on the identification of regional characteristics;
integration of geography with natural and social sciences contributes to factors such as the possibility of a comprehensive study of complex issues between society and nature
It is possible to distinguish several directions of geographical globalist research in the study of global changes and problems of the modern world and global regional and state levels
Research at the global level is based on the legitimacy of the unity of the geographical envelope
Concepts of environmental integrity served as the basis for forming the position of a single space in social and economic geography
Currently, the concept of a single ecological space will appear globally - "Earth is our common home," determining the location of mankind
Based on these names, the integrated nature of global projections is determined geographically
Regional-level studies will be based on the "Global in the Region" position in geographical science
First, many problems that are global in nature have two different meanings of this position, arising at the regional level; secondly, the global problem has regional features
For example, the regional environmental problem caused by the Aral Sea disaster is among the global environmental problems that will be addressed in the context of local regional characteristics (natural-economic social)
The state level is determined by the fact that the solution of global problems directly depends on the decisions taken in the territory of the state
At the local level, at the level of development of financial and economic opportunities, States determine their priority areas of global problems depending on the natural characteristics of the territory, the structure and nature of population settlement [5]
Research in this direction is the outstanding Russian geographer Y.

N. Smirnyagina "global herbology"
Mironenko was reflected in the ideas of a "comprehensive socio-geographical revival"
In geographical globalism, along with level studies, there was a study of global changes and problems by industry
In this regard, certain areas of geography in geoglobalism in the last decade of the 20th century (geography of the world economy geoecology geoinformation political geography and t.

Integrated territorial studies
Figure 2 - Geographical Globalism Research Directions
In accordance with the research goals of geographical globalism, integrated territorial studies prevail
In general, the study of global changes and problems in the modern world is effective in jointly considering natural and social factors in the territory
To make decisions recognizing the laws of complex issues of interaction between society and nature, it is necessary to study their spatial organization as a single system
Geoglobalism, developing on the basis of geography, on the other hand, meaningfully enriches its previous industries
Modern global problems are classified by scientists as follows [6]:
Table 2 - Classification of global issues
These global problems are closely interlinked and are covered by the development of the environmental crisis on Earth.
Figure 3 - Interconnection of Global Issues
About half of the cost of solving global problems is the cost of solving environmental problems
Global environmental problems - a set of environmental problems identified at the global regional and national levels
The environmental dangers of a major geopolitical problem include the destruction of the natural ecosystems of the ozone layer Pollution of the atmosphere of the world's oceans and oceans.
They can only be resolved with the participation of all countries
The global nature of environmental problems necessitates the mobilization of all countries to address it; the impossibility of losing the ecological crisis without reducing all types of weapons; The meaninglessness of waging not only nuclear war, but even a simple war as the biosphere is contaminated all over the world; creation of new qualitative methods and means of interaction with nature, which will become the basis of life of reconstruction of technological structure of modern civilization; Improved efficiency and emergency powers of national environmental authorities B
It is necessary to solve every global problem, because its development leads to catastrophe - the destruction of civilization
Global regional national programmes will be established to address global challenges, but they still lack coherence and coordination

- Almaty: Era 2011
Uranium Industry Industrial Economy Fields
Times of Uranium and Beryllium of the 21st Century
Horizons of our future speak about the fact that Kazakhstan has many state capacities
The breakdown of economic ties in place after the collapse of the Union brought Kazakhstan more composure than other union republics
Almost all the Republic's production, which has become the country's raw material base, has ceased
It seems that some distrust of independence in the country for the first time was
The leadership of the republic, returning there, took into account the creation of an independent economy of an independent country, thus graduating from factories and factories
Head of State Nursultan Nazarbayev paid special attention to transfer of metallurgical complexes of Kazakhstan to labor rhythm
Every visit of the President to Kendinsky Altai Territory should begin with the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk
60 years ago, the plant began to produce its first products
Today, unique production leads the world market
Over the years of independence, our country is reborn again
To prepare fuel for nuclear power plants today the most powerful enterprise in Eastern Europe and Asia Ulba Metallurgical Plant
At that time, the entire Union of Soviets and the Warsaw Pact countries provided 85% of the need for these products
World-class monopoly enterprises named
Products of the Ulba Metallurgical Plant reached the Earth to the Moon in the sky
In Soviet Lunokhod there are products of this plant
In the field of space and the military-industrial complex, there is not yet a single unique enterprise producing the same strategically important products
That is, the Ulba Metallurgical Plant is one of the features and pride of our independent Kazakhstan
26% of proven natural uranium reserves on Earth are concentrated in Kazakhstan
That is, if work on the operation of nuclear power plants develops in the future, many countries will come to our country in search of the necessary fuel
And this is the only enterprise in the country for the production of natural uranium - Ulba Metallurgical Plant
All the properties of uranium separation and dementia are well known
Therefore, the Ulba Metallurgical Plant was originally built to create atomic weapons
But due to the then policy, this task is assigned to another enterprise, and the Ust-Kamenogorsk plant remained among the enterprises producing raw materials
Because natural uranium is not so dangerous on its own
When he enriches, he gains strength
Therefore, the Ulba Metallurgical Plant is entrusted with the task of providing nuclear reactors and diving boats with the necessary fuel
On uranium fuel of nuclear power plants
supplier became the main enterprise in the union
That is, the enterprise as part of the military-industrial complex served peaceful purposes
Not so long ago, Ulba Metallurgical Plant, producing three such important products, entered the world market
We believe that the plant, which for a long time worked on special orders of a closed enterprise and survived a difficult situation in the conditions of the collapse of the Union of Soviets, will take its place in the world market
Because these rare metals, which have been mastered only for the next fifty years, still remain amazing for the child
In the XXI century, a recycler will certainly be widely used
The most beautiful structures in Ust-Kamenogorsk will build microdistricts as a whole thanks to this NMZ (Ulba Metallurgical Plant)
By the end of the eighties, NMZ annually generated an average income of $150 million.
This is approximately 22 billion tenge for the current national currency
Thus, with his income he made a great contribution to the budget and provided work for as many people as contributed to the transformation of Ust-Kamenogorsk into a growing city
Currently, the joint-stock company Ulba Metallurgical Plant
Kazatomprom works as part of
Nazarbayev visited America and signed several important agreements with American firms
Especially mentioned are signed agreements on beryllium and uranium
Uranium and beryllium, and precious metals of the 21st century
Only these two are important in the conclusion of a special contract
Yes, this special condition regulates the sale of enriched uranium to Kazakhstan at a decent price in the USA
It is still not clear how to sell (sometimes too cheap to sell, sometimes there was an obstacle)
We do not have a nuclear power plant, and about a hundred nuclear power plants operate in the USA
Now we buy technology for fusing beryllium mixtures and will sell products
Why are uranium and beryllium so distinguished?
Uranium on the one hand causes fear
But the treasury that gives uranium and energy
Like matches, you can make an atomic bomb that destroys people and get a source of human thermal energy
A quarter of the world's uranium reserves lie on the land of Kazakhstan
Its size will be 926 thousand (that is, a million tons), and world reserves will reach 4 million tons
Kazakhstan ranks second in the world in uranium reserves
60% of CIS uranium reserves in Kazakhstan account for 40% of production
So far, a place with a slogan has been found in 53 points of the country
Mostly they can have uranium reserves in six regions
If now the world produces 50-60 thousand tons of uranium per year, then imagine how much the treasury of the Kazakh land will cost
The largest projected uranium reserves are the Shu-Sarysu and Syrdarya regions of Kazakhstan (Table 1)
Table 1 - Uranium reserves forecast
From it you can get tens of thousands of times more than for strong oil
Ten per cent of existing uranium is not yet used
From a ton of ore you can get 0045-006 grams of pure uranium
This field was founded in 1976 by geologists of the Volkovsky expedition N.
Petrov and L
Now there are three large mines in the Suzakskoye field (the largest Ingkar field)
Uranium is thrown out of the ground by the force of acid
All rock and stone zones of Kazakhstan are filled with uranium
The first uranium mine of the entire Soviet Union, and not only Kazakhstan, whose uranium production began from the bowels of Karatau, was installed in the Kordai steppe in the early fifties
Shu-Sarysu Ingkar Budenovsk is located in the Kordai steppe
Munkuduk mines are located in this region of Karatau and Betbakdala, half of the uranium reserves lie in the Suzak region
What is the quality of uranium in it? There are two types of hydrothermal (rod) and sedimentary uranium deposits in the country
Hydrothermal ore is found in the Kokshetau massif of Northern Kazakhstan
The main source of uranium are infiltration deposits of the layer on the mesa and cenazoya platforms in the South of Kazakhstan
All deposits of the Shu-Sarysu region are focused on paleogenic and Upper Cretaceous formations
Kokshetau was found in the Mangistau steppe in the Atbasar region, where Akmola large plants worked in Aktau
Figure 1 - NPP in Kazakhstan
The two-volume book "Uranium deposits of Kazakhstan," published only in recent years, briefly describes a large number of uranium ores
How many Gelogs scouted vast steppes and discovered huge sources of treasure
Therefore, our country ranks second in the world in uranium reserves
In Soviet times, with the urgent search for atomic weapons, huge stocks of uranium were tested for forty years on this Kazakh land and led to an array in which huge uranium lay
Now nuclear power plants will serve as fuel for people who will be the powers of the world, not bombs.
When oil is depleted and coal is depleted (these are also events during the 21st century), the need for uranium increases when a person receives heat and light from atomic energy
Of the 238 uranium isotopes, neutrons are repeated and reproduced
Speed in our Aktau
in a neutron reactor, such fuel burns on one side and is updated on the other
Now there are more than 500 nuclear power plants in the world
In Japan, 70-80% of the capacity available in France is obtained from nuclear power plants
Kazakhstan has project to build nuclear power plant
It is necessary in scientific and practical terms, and not due to lack of electricity
Uranium is now sold mainly in raw ore
And it is much more profitable to sell in enrichment
If you sell everything 20 times more expensive than raw uranium in a highly enriched state, then Kazakhstan will bring $15 billion in profit from one uranium
In the meantime, we only find 60 million dollars of uranium
This is very small
Hence the fact that not all Americans are interested in Kazakhstan
Kilogram of this uranium - $4400 per ton costs $4400 thousand
That is, it is many times more expensive than any non-ferrous metal
One gram of uranium equals two and a half tons of coal
Kazakhstan, which owns a quarter of uranium existing on Earth, will bring wealth to its people with its treasure
Stepnogorsk, located in the steppe zone of Northern Kazakhstan in the Soviet years, is not indicated on the geographical map
This became a secret as a cover for products emanating from the United States here
Currently, in Stepnogorsk, uranium ore processing is associated with enrichment and transportation
Tselinny Mining and Chemical Plant works
But the work of the enterprise associated with a decrease in world prices for uranium cannot be justified
Due to the periodic shutdown of the enterprise, cases of pollution of the environment with low radioactive waste of production arose
Now the company is headed by the closed joint-stock company Kazsabton Holland - Israel
The cost of one gram of uranium has now increased from 18 to 23-24 dollars
Uranium production in mines and mines will be successful in the near future up to 28-35 dollars
Stepnogorsk still provides Russia with the bulk of fuel at nuclear power plants
In July 2008, a new Kazakh-Japanese enterprise for the extraction of natural uranium at the Western Mynkuduk deposit was opened in the Suzak district of South Kazakhstan region
Mine Operator -
Appak LLP was created on the basis of close partnership of the National Nuclear Company Kazatomprom with Sumitomo and Kansai Electric Power corporations
In 2010, the Western Mynkuduk field plans to operate within 25 years, having a capacity of 1000 tons of uranium concentrate
Appac LLP products to be used to provide uranium powder to nuclear power plants operating in Japan
First of all, it is planned to assemble fuel pellets and powder of ceramic uranium dioxide of Kazakhstan abroad
In the future, it is expected that the production and certification of uranium for the Japanese market will allow the company to develop the country's Ulba Metallurgical Plant in the future to gain its share in the Japanese market
Currently, uranium production is the most profitable for NMZ itself
Financial revenues coming to the plant are withdrawn from this industry
Beryllium tantalum production is also increasing well
As a result of such positive cases, in 2005 alone, the development of 600 jobs began in factory enterprises
700 people employed in the field
Production volume of Ulba Metallurgical Plant increased
15 billion tenge spent on production increase alone
Opening ceremony of "Semizbai-U" China - Kazakhstan (in Kyzylorda region) Central Asian News took place in Almaty on April 29
The enterprise will be engaged in uranium ore mining and export to China
Iirkol field, where it is planned to produce 750 tons of uranium per year, is the first mine between Kazakhstan and China put into industrial operation in the field of nuclear energy
In 2009, 500 tons of natural uranium were produced here
This mine will operate for 25 years
In accordance with the contract between the companies of Kazakhstan and China, production at the Iirkol field will be directed to export to cover the needs of Chinese enterprises in nuclear energy
18,925 tons of uranium were transferred to Semizbay-U for industrial processing under the subsoil use contract
Another field was created at Khorasan I field in Kyzylorda region in partnership with Japanese companies Marubeni and Toshiba
Exploration at the field began in the late 70s of the last century, more detailed exploration was carried out in the early 80s
National Nuclear Company has previously signed contracts on behalf of Kazakhstan with a number of foreign companies with developed nuclear industry for the export of uranium ore to international markets
Among the named states was France Japan Russia India Canada
Now this list has been replenished with another pocket international client of the national company - China
New source of foreign exchange earnings "Kazakhstan ranks second in the world after Australia in uranium ore reserves." The state should actively strengthen its position in the international uranium business market and extract leading positions among uranium exporting countries around the world
The global uranium empire Kazatomprom develops its business not only in the mining industry, but also in the field of management in this field with the construction of nuclear power plants
At the same time, entrepreneurship is actively developing internationally
The company is engaged in the construction of nuclear power plants in China
Already today, Kazatomprom owns a stake in the share capital of Westinghouse Electric, one of the largest corporations in the field of nuclear energy and mechanical engineering in the United States
Westinghouse Electric has a 10 per cent stake of $540 million.
dollars
Kazatomprom was acquired in 2007
In the uranium industry, Kazakhstan's role in ensuring long-term reproduction of the country in the coming years will be special
Kazakhstan today reached the level of state status, providing the global market slogan
Because today we are ahead of Australia and Canada, which occupies the leading position in terms of uranium production in the world
Kazakhstan ranks second in world in uranium ore reserves
According to forecasts, uranium raw materials in the country amount to about one and a half million tons
According to the World Nuclear Association (World Nuclear Association), in 2008 Canada produced 9 thousand tons of uranium that is 8430 tons more, than in Australia
If the national nuclear company Kazatomprom industry by the end of 2009 is called the world's leading enterprise for the extraction of 15 thousand tons of uranium ore
Table 2 - Volume of uranium production in Kazakhstan and projected part of the year (thousand tons)
Kazakhstan's leading position on uranium mining to be maintained till 2030
In subsequent years, a significant amount of funds was invested in the development of the industry
For example, over the past 15 years, investments amounted to $3 billion.
USA
This will lead to a steady increase in production: since 2004, uranium production has increased by more than 6 times
The Republic of Kazakhstan provides more than 35% of the total uranium production in the world, while the key player is Kazatomprom, which produces uranium in Kazakhstan

Benzene ethanol recovery process
Results of investigation of activity of catalysts made with modification of zeolitic HZSM-5 with two - and trivalent metals (Mg Sa La Ce) at alkylation of benzene with ethanol in operation are given.
The results showed that the catalyst with Mg raised the conversion to benzene to 85-110% and the maximum conversion was 759%.
As shown, this conversion will not only lead to an increase in its catalytic activity and an increase in the selectivity process, but will also increase the consumption of ethylbenzene
Mg and Ca cations are included in the zeolite network with the replacement of the framework of isomorphic La and Ce ions mainly on the surface, while the size of the oxides formed due to them does not allow them to penetrate into the holes of the zeolite, while active metalloactive centers are formed in the alkylation reaction
Modification of EIZSM-5 zeolite magnesium provided formation of the maximum acid results, At input of Mg in zeolite the decrease in concentration of strong acid from 072 to 039 mmol/g is established

Clay adsorbent vermiculite heavy metals alumosilicate
Currently, pollution of the water basin in the environment is widespread due to the very active intervention of humanity in the environment due to the discharge of agricultural domestic and wastewater into lake-river waters
The pollution of these water basins makes it difficult to use water not only in drinking water but also in industrial and agricultural activities.
Heavy metal pollution affects the fauna and flora of the region, depending on their concentration
Today, one of the pressing issues is the production of new types of effective modified sorbents for their isolation, due to the fact that in the modern composition of wastewater of industrial enterprises there are a lot of heavy metals of phenols and surfactants.
In solving the relevance and purpose of the work, attention was paid to the cheapness and ease of naturally modified sorbents as a local material
Therefore, it is important to solve the environmental problem using their model solutions for modifying and purifying heavy metal ions of sorbents such as vermiculite lips.
Traditional industries for the use of clay minerals as adsorbents - purification from oil products, including pre-treatment and regeneration of mineral oils, adsorption-catalytic purification of aromatic compounds from unlimited compounds, treatment of sewage and natural waters lighting wines and juices
Used in treatment of sewage and natural water filtration properties of clay minerals
Therefore, for the purpose of wastewater treatment of indicators and dyes production using bentonite, a pilot-industrial method has been developed [1]
The ability of bentonite clay to efficiently absorb nonionic surface active substances in water ± A3) was carried out in the technology of purification of layered waters of the gas industry [2]
Studying this type of bentonite with domestic vermiculite is very important
One of the main characteristics of vermiculites is its cation exchange capacity
Unfortunately, the literature does not specify unique and reliable methods for determining transition cations
In the works [4-6] proposed by the authors [3] using the methods of investigation [4] accelerated in classicity [5] available in the literature, variable clayey mineral cations are also extremely necessary for the analysis of vermiculite samples.
Purpose of our work Study of features of sorption of heavy metal ions (Pb2 + Cr2 + Cu2 + +) in modified sorbent with increased volume of spontaneous absorption of metal ions using various methods of processing of natural sorbent from vermiculite deposit in Tulkubas district of South Kazakhstan region
To study the patterns of sorption of heavy metal ions in natural mineral adsorbents in order to apply various chemical methods of purifying water from heavy metal ions, the following experiments were created:
In modified sorbents, the process of adsorption of solutions made in the range of mol/dm3 in special 0001-001 salts of copper lead and chromium (III) of modified types of vermiculite, made under preliminary thermal acid conditions, was investigated.
Modified natural vermiculite is obtained as sorbent for metal sorption.
For determination of cationic sorption capacity of sorbent in different concentration "x
Made model solution of metal salts "
Solutions prepared with distilled water
Left for 1 day to establish the equilibrium of 05 sorbents in 20 ml of copper chromium and a model lead solution to determine sorption capacity
After 1 day, the content of metal ions separating the solutions from the sorbent is determined
The error of metal ion concentration in the solution ± 1% Agilent700 is carried out on the atomic adsorption spectrometer ESICP 710 OES
The metal ion adsorption value was calculated by the following formula: A = (d-C2) -V )/m
C1 is the primary concentration of ions of the analysed metal mol/dm3;
- concentration of analysed metal ions after equilibrium is established after absorption of sorbent mol/dm3;
R% is the amount of metal ions impregnated during the sorbent;
Table 1 - Sorption of Cu ion in vermiculite (200 С) (mass of vermiculite sorbents - 05 g)
In the vermiculite sorbent, where the solutions of this copper ion are modified, the concentrations of 0001 mol/dm -001 mol/dm3 in the range of 8696% to 9699% (Table 1) show a direct relationship in vermiculite
The most optimal absorption value in this study is 1806 mg/dm3 and 89%
Table 2 - Sorption of Pb ion in vermiculite (200 С) (mass of vermiculite sorbents - 05 g)
The effective sorption of Pb ion in modified vermiculite was 7,222% and the amount of sorbed metal ion per liter was 4783 mg (Table 2).
It can be seen that the adsorption isotherm of vermiculite treated at 200 C is directly proportional to the lead ion concentration and sorbent amount
One of the metals that generally enter the environment with a large amount of lead ions and its compounds, since according to old technologies, in order to increase the octane amount of gasoline at some car plants, tetraethyl-containing ones are still added to the car as fuel, carrying waste together with gas and again contributing to environmental pollution
Water-biota is one of the ions of a toxic metal that can be contaminated again in the chain of the human body, especially in spring-flood snow-rain waters, eroding the surface and entering lake-river waters.
Table 3 - Sorption of Cr3 + ion in vermiculite (2000C) (mass of vermiculite sorbents - 05 g)
Adsorption of the Cr ion in the range of 001mol/dm is usually rectilinear in the bentonite sorbent and the vermiculite sorbent to 0008 mol/dm3 and after this concentration the absorption activity of this ion is reduced
In the bentonite sorbent, spontaneous sorption of metal ions at a concentration of 0008 mol/dm3 is 992%
In bentonite there is an alumosilicate octahedron between two tetrahedrons in the structure of the main rock-forming mineral Na - montmorillonite
They build one floor together
Interlayer water and Na + Ca2 + Mg2 + ions and less K + are [6]
Vermiculite clay is one of the most common minerals
This is a deep change mica product
In nature, it occurs not only in small quantities of fractions, but also in the form of large crystalline mica
Vermiculite alumina resistance to temperature higher than other thermal insulation materials
At 11000C vermiculite mort 16000C, the temperature of the beam, as well as the minimum temperature is observed for fried vermiculite with lower hydroscopicity 7000C
Vermiculite supports are the lowest in bulk among insulating materials used up to 10000C temperature and the most temperature resistant
The process of producing vermiculite sawdust consists in the following: natural vermiculite is ground and purified from particles less than 1 mm 800-9000C is fired at temperature
During firing, various chemical compounds occur in the composition of vermiculite particles, between which air cavities are formed
That is why in this work the adsorption of ions of heavy virculite metals, such as thermal-acid-activated bentonite, which was received from a domestic deposit in the Tulkubas district of the South Kazakhstan region, was investigated.
X-ray phase method investigated what structural changes are subjected to this activated vermiculitis
Chemical analysis of vermiculite composition (Tulkubas)
The results of the analysis are shown in Table 4.
Table 4 - Chemical composition of vermiculite activated with natural and thermooxylic acid
As can be seen from the table, after the thermoacid modification, vermiculite contains, A no
Except Fe	slightly reduced quantity
Perhaps vermiculite binds the chain C - O - C and C - O - and the series C - O - Fe after thermomechanical modification
After thermo-mechanical modification, the Al - O - C bond is exchanged C - O-C
Accordingly, the share of Si4 + in the mineral increased
Based on the results of the study, in the drawing versions of the IR spectrometer, an increase in the amount of SiO2 oxide in activated sorbents was observed, that is, what we observe from this table can be proved by an increase in the amount of silicon
An increase in the amount of this silicon oxide increasing the activity of the modified vermiculite can be characterized.
Together, a specially modified vermiculite sorbent can absorb up to 87-97% of copper ions in solution
Modified sorbent of vermiculite is detected in solution on 85-99% of lead ions, and chromium ions - on 70-99%.
Quantitative doses of silicon element as a result of Si02 and chemical analysis, increasing sorption properties in modified vermiculite as a result of various physical and chemical studies

Rate of development of amplitude with beginning of growing period of ontogenesis of genotypic endurance factor
Currently, in Kazakhstan on large coal in agriculture - stabilization of grain production is one of the main tasks of agricultural sciences and production
This question is particularly acute in connection with the transition to a market economy, on the one hand, with the aim of becoming part of the 50 developed countries of the world and a significant condition for stabilizing its economic potential and ensuring food security.
One such additional source of grain production is the cultivation of winter crops in Kazakhstan
Among cereals, winter wheat is the largest crop
It exceeds all grain crops by crop from 40 to 10-12 c/ha
At the same time, spring differs from wheat in a number of advantages, although of no less food value; he makes good use of autumn winter early spring moist and nutrients from soil; reliably protected from groundwater water and wind erosion; of particular importance in weed control; less frequently infected with diseases and "carried through" due to injury of a grain pest and maintains vegetation from 7-10 to 15-30 days earlier [1]
The vegetation period of plants is called the period from seed to ripening of grain
Plants of grain spikes in the growing season undergo several stages of phenological growth and development
They are: rash and seed fruit; sleet; interweaving; tube extension; pounding (dizziness); prosperity; maturation (dairy and full maturation)
At phenological stages of growth and development, external morphological changes of plants are observed [2]
Growth of crops requires physiological processes (photosynthesis, water uptake and nutrient use)
These processes occur at only one optimum temperature
Different cultures have optimal minimum maximum temperatures and in each growth phase these temperatures differ
With a faster increase in temperature as the plant grows, it quickly passes in the phases of faster growth
And in spring, the more cold days, the more phases of growth
For example, process of rest (breath) begins at 0 OS to temperature and amplifies with growth of temperature, and at achievement 35-400C temperature worsen also temperature 500C - it stops
When the temperature rises, the use of nutrients in the water worsens, as the air
humidity decreases
The lower the humidity, the greater the drought
High temperatures impair pollination of plants
In agricultural production, growing and frost-free (cold) periods are of great importance
The growing season includes the period from the beginning of seed growth (resumption of vegetation of perennial crops) to the ripening of new seeds (cessation of vegetation of perennial crops)
Long-term cultures will also continue in subsequent years
Frosts strongly affect the duration of the growing season
A painless period is considered the period until the last freezing of spring and the first autumn freeze
This period should be taken into account when zoning crops
If the growing season is shorter than the frost-free (cold) period, then these crops are insomnia
The average temperature in the growing season and its set are derived by accumulating average daily temperatures before the beginning and end of the growing time of this crop [3]
Wheat inside grain crops as one of the most valuable food plants by almost 230 million.
occupies the sown area of ​ ​ ha, of which winter wheat crops make up 35%, and its grain products average 254 c/ha
Mostly soft wheat is grown as winter wheat in Kazakhstan
In this regard, the features of the development and growth technology of this type will be considered below
Winter wheat is different in biology from wheat
Unlike spring wheat, its vegetation line begins in the fall, and next year summer will come
In the process of vital activity, the release of winter wheat into the bottom tube passes the stages of flourishing and ripening of ears
The first three stages will be held in the fall, the rest - in the spring and summer of next year
Consider its biological features for these periods [4]
Table 1 - Temperature favorable for winter wheat maturation during the growing season
It has been proved that about 80-90 tons per hectare can be obtained from modern varieties of winter wheat using a scientifically sound fertilizer system
The amount of winter wheat demand for nutrients depends on the specificity of the variety for the period of plant development under the conditions of their cultivation in the soil composition
Preparation of soil for winter wheat for the resource characteristics of a specific farm in soil climatic conditions of the territory grown for advanced crops
tethering and processing are done by planar or donated means
Distinctive feature of winter wheat - its normal development in dense soils since autumn [5]
Important condition for production of high-quality seeds from winter wheat
Therefore, winter wheat seeds made from last year's products set for the quality of first-class sowing are used.
Because the grain seeds that have just been harvested after harvesting in the time remaining before sowing do not have time to pass the ripening period - the state of rest - as a result, their laboratory susceptibility does not exceed 70-80%
They will reach confectionary digestion in 20-30 days
Seeds made from freshly harvested grain have late famine with low field vegetation and rare crops, which reduces grain yields
Seeds of last year's harvest quickly and massively winter and give a significant additional product
This indicates that the farm needs a transient supply of winter wheat seeds [6]
The choice of winter wheat harvesting method depends on its general condition directly on the weather
Harvesting of grown products is carried out by the method of separate packing directly for the period of complete ripening of grain at humidity of 30-35% in the middle of grain wax

Healthy lifestyles of students with physical activity
President of Kazakhstan - Head of State N
Nazarbayev, speaking to students of Nazarbayev University on the topic "Kazakhstan on the way to a society of education," said: "In the XXI century, Kazakhstanis should become a nation of long-term builders
Health should be formed primarily by the person himself
I urge you and all students to abandon bad habits - to play sports - to lead a healthy lifestyle "- stressed [1]
In the State Program for the Development of Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011-2020, which is currently being implemented in fulfilling the task at this historically important lesson of Nursultan Abittula, one of the main goals is "the formation of an intellectually physical and spiritually developed citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan in educational organizations" [2]
Student life is not only a skillful mastery of your chosen future profession and spending four years in a large city with peers, but also the beginning of an independent life is a stage in the formation of your own criteria for personal attitude to the world around you, to health and lifestyle
The success of adapting a young organism to a new university environment with difficulties in obtaining knowledge in its conditions requires, first of all, his good health
Motor activity, which is considered the most important component of a healthy lifestyle, is one of the prerequisites for the formation of a high level of health, characterized by real qualitative and quantitative indicators
In recent years, 20-40% of students are diagnosed with various chronic diseases, and 40% of university graduates complete university with indicators of poor health
The responsibility of student youth for their health is minimal, and the factors that negatively affect health (tobacco use and
) between them is growing distribution
Therefore, in order to preserve and strengthen the health of student youth studying at universities, it is necessary to quickly develop and implement a large-scale program that provides for socio-pedagogical and preventive and curative measures
General physical movement activates metabolism and energy in the body during human development and growth, increases palpitations and breathing, as well as increases the functions of some other organs that play an important role in adapting a person to constantly changing conditions of the internal environment
Thus, movement activity favorably affects a growing organism, being an unstable factor in human activity
But physical activity should not be high
If a person has high motor activity, a higher rate of heart attacks, difficulty breathing, increased fluctuations in the urinary tract
Currently, in the context of modern education, one of the main issues is the improvement of the functional capabilities and efficiency of the student youth body.
The influence of various complex requirements for student youth in organized educational processes on the innovative education system leads to disruption of the order of movement, increase body fatigue and decrease in efficiency
The goal of our study is to educate a healthy generation capable of leading a healthy lifestyle without losing their activity, no matter what complex requirements are presented to student youth during the learning process.
The main objectives for achieving this goal are:
a) studying functional changes in the body under the influence of motor activity; a) identification of normal motor activity for young people of different ages;
b) knowledge of energy features of motor activity
Motor actions are a physiological necessity for the human body from the first days of life
Actions during the development and growth of the body will improve metabolism and energy in the body, increase cardiac activity and respiration
At the same time, it constantly increases the activities of some other members who play an important role in adapting the body to changing conditions of the internal environment
Long-term satisfaction of such a need has a very strong impact on health, which can lead to rapid aging and mortality
Insufficient motor activity is also observed in our country, especially in those who engage in mental work characteristic of the majority of the population
This group includes not only mental workers, but also young students, whose main work is training
Currently, most of the time students spend on a mobile phone in front of a computer and on the Internet with insufficient motor activity.
Today, special physical education classes are organized in all universities of the country for a high level of physical activity in the lifestyle of student youth
The main goal of all educational institutions in teaching this subject is to prepare student youth for their future profession, as well as turn their various physical exercises into everyday habits and bring physical activity to normal indicators, which in turn is an effective way of forming a healthy lifestyle
But currently physical education classes students in universities
Exemption from physical education due to the deterioration of the health of a large part of the student youth or the completion of this discipline through participation in special medical groups is widespread
Numerous studies have shown that exemption from such classes or exercise through participation in special medical groups leads to a significant decrease in motor activity
For example, you can see a decrease in the motor activity of student youth exempted from physical education for health reasons by 2 times compared to student youth in normal health
Activities related to learning are important in the life of student youth, and the activity of the movement is interlinked with these educational activities
We know that due to lack of physical activity, the young body undergoes negative changes in cognitive functions, such as remembering thoughts about mental abilities
Large student youth under the influence of various reasons (lack of time creates various difficulties in the educational process
) do not exercise
But this is a very erroneous decision, because most young people do not take into account that when moving along the street with physical exercises, you can perform home or lecture classes in laboratory classes
For example, in the morning - gymnastics or training, when on the way to university he walks, reducing the use of various modes of transport, and in the evening, when doing gymnastics or exercises, health becomes stronger
And for the weekend more time and opportunities to exercise
That is, you always need to devote time to exercise
The modern process of education at the university should be organized not only for educational activities, but also depending on the abilities of student youth
For example, education requirements at a very high level have a strong psycho-physical impact on the body of student youth who have not yet formed
Lack of motor activity contributes to hypokinesia causing acute and chronic diseases [3118-119 b
Numerous studies of recent years have shown that only 2-3% of modern students have a high level of general somatic health, that many students experience psychoemotional stress, which indicates misbehaviour of simple fundamentals of a healthy lifestyle
Most student youth treat their health with irresponsible responsibility for spreading dependent health factors (tobacco use and
) allows
Due to such indifference, the health of the young body deteriorates - various negative conditions
Therefore, each student must understand that the formation of a healthy lifestyle and its basis are closely related to physical activity
According to the results of hygiene research, the vast majority of student youth in the daytime are in static condition up to 82-85%
That is, training or work in a fixed place
Immobility sitting at the desk and desk affects the activities of many systems of the body, especially the respiratory system and blood vessels of the heart
With prolonged sitting, breathing deepens, metabolism decreases, which leads to a decrease in mental work: weak memory weakens the coordination of movement is disturbed by the time of the thinking operation, that is, the performance of all members of the body is reduced
The influence of insufficient motor activity on the physical development of a young organism showed very interesting information
Average growth and functional indicators of development and growth of youth engaged in sports, compared to difficulties not engaged in sports, remain high: body length 16-17 years 57-6 cm
and body weight 8-85 kg
around the chest 25-5 cm
hand compression force 45-57 kg
Viability of ha of lungs more than 05-14 liters
A specific explanation for this can be seen in the following practice
When examining the muscular part of the animal with a microscope, there are from 30 to 60 bristles at rest at one mm square muscle
In the same part, after strengthening exercise, there were up to 30,000 brushes, that is, tens of times more
In addition, the diameter of each brush is doubled
This suggests that in conditions of silence, they do not participate in circulation, and when forces hit the muscles, they take part in bloodshed as nutrients
Thus, it can be seen that when the muscles work, the substances grow many times compared to the rest period
Muscles receive from 40 to 56% of a person's weight, and if the body's cell does not carry the nutrients it needs and does not have good performance, it is obvious that health will not be normal
Exercise affects the development of the following functions of the nervous system: mobility and alignment of the nervous process
Even the power of mental action cannot be realized without movement
Mental labor requires mobilization of muscle strength, as the signal from muscles activates brain actions
With the appearance of excess weight of 15-40% from a decrease in the mode of movement in young people, a decrease in most opportunities of the developing body is closely associated
Direct link between student performance and physical development is determined [4 178 b
Although researchers did not find a relationship between academic performance and the physical development of student youth at the university, there is a connection
Because constant exercise and sports - resistance to stress - accumulates such better qualities as the ability to think
All this leads to an increase in the efficiency of education in universities
] And ignoring motor activity are various risk factors not involved in sports (tobacco use
) contributing to accumulation, sooner or later this leads to the emergence of various diseases and leads to a decrease in mental and physical performance
Student youth say they lack the strength to engage in physical education and sports, and some of them for their health reasons
Even some students do not hide that young people do not have an orientation to a sport in terms of the importance of physical education and sports
The results of the study of the motor activity of student youth studying at the university show the tendency of young people to a low-mobility lifestyle
The position of the trade union movement of students can be divided into 3 levels, which differ from each other in the nature of the movement regime:
First level of motor activity
At this level, the mobile activity of students is simple motor activity, limited only by daily education and household activities
No physical exercise aimed at the goal will be here
This is a state of hypocnesia
It, of course, is explained by the "low level of motor activity"
Second level of motor activity
Here, along with the daily actions of students, mandatory forms of spectator activity take part, which are largely associated with the frequency of physical education classes
But exercise classes, which are held only 2 times a week, are not enough for a growing young body, which should also be supplemented by its exercises
Third level of motor activity
This level includes 2 previous levels, including spontaneous exercises and motor actions related to the occupation of a certain sport
That is, on weekends, sports sections have a high level of motor activity under the influence of physical exercises such as conducting various events or exercises
Note that the third level of motor activity is the most beneficial and favorable for the student's health
Physical culture (third level of motor activity) as a whole is a strong tool to preserve and promote the health of students in modern conditions
Within the university there are special features of the motor activity of students, which is explained by classes in physical education in the school week mode
Realization in the university of opportunities to increase the motor activity of students in the process of physical education - opens the way to the development of physical and intellectual abilities of young people
Students should be able to understand what trends occur in the body under the influence of the human body, what are the ways to avoid psychoemotional loads and the rules of health protection
Therefore, in order to normalize the motor activity of students in the process of studying at a university and realize the potential of youth movement, teachers of the Department of Physical Culture need to regularly conduct research on the motor activity of students from the first month of study at the university
Also, after analyzing the results revealed by the peculiarities of motor activity of students studying in various specialties, it is necessary to organize pedagogical activities at individual educational and practical classes that increase motor activity in the semester in the academic year, i.e. during training in all universities and stimulate motor activity

Human health I R becomes a factor determining not only its full existence, but also the potential of its capabilities
The state of health of the population, in turn, determines the magnitude of the socio-economic cultural and industrial development of the country
The health sector, which is a single, well-developed and socially oriented system that serves to ensure the quality and continuity of the timely delivery of medical care, is one of the main priorities in the Republic in terms of sustainable and sustainable growth in the well-being of the population
In modern society, social responsibility for the state of health of children lies with the state and parents
Child health is one of the main areas of social policy for the protection of children
Protection of children's health in Kazakhstan is provided for in many legal instruments and strengthened by State programmes of the health system
Article 8 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan," adopted in the Messages of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the people on August 8, 2002
"The right of the child to health care" [2]
Correct assessment of people's health due to lack of uniformly obtained motivated definition of "health" becomes difficult
According to the charter of the World Health Organization (1958), health is understood as "the complete physical social and spiritual well-being of people, as well as the presence or absence of shortcomings in disease and physics"
This concept includes a list of the most widely obtained estimates that cannot be signs of health
The size of income among socially favorable conditions for such indicators is the presence of personal vehicles of communal comfort
The health of the population is due to a good standard of living, but the above factors will never become indicators of health
At the same time, it is necessary to understand that health is not only a biological social category, therefore it is also an opportunity to fully properly perform social services
But healthy and sick people have very wide opportunities for social services.
The definition of "health" does not quantify its extent
end and XXI century.
Kazakhstan has undergone political and socio-economic changes in all spheres of society and the State, especially in the 1990s
Children belong to the part of the population that is very sensitive to every change in society
Child health information plays a special role in population health research
Child health is an integral part of public health [3]
In modern society, social responsibility for the state of health of children lies with the state and parents
Child health is one of the main areas of social policy for the protection of children [4]
The signs of health include demographic indicators of the development of morbidity
Among these signs of public health, especially demographic -
ticks (average duration of life-long breeding age) are particularly suspicious
Cannot be obtained as a health indicator due to the fact that it is possible to artificially regulate reproduction and it is influenced by ethnic features
Artificial decline in fertility in some countries corresponds to high other health indicators
Conversely, high fertility in some ethnic groups leads to lower health outcomes
Therefore, reproduction with other indicators should be considered comprehensively for health assessment without considering them separately
In describing the health of peoples, some authors do not support the possibility of using mortality rates
The main argument in this opinion is the lack of correspondence between morbidity and the number of deaths, but death never occurs without disease
Between these measures change in one direction, even if there is no rigid proportion
A high mortality rate among men by age period cannot be obtained as an indicator of health, although it shows a low probability of their life
According to Ilyin, mortality cannot be obtained as a sign of health, since it depends not only on the biology of people, but also on social factors in many cases
But the author acknowledges that "the health of the population (individual) - medical (biological) - is a social concept"
According to Lisitsyn, health should be considered exclusively from the point of view of social and biological communication, while the number of deaths from endogenous and exogenous causes also characterizes biological factors
At the same time, the mortality rate can be obtained as a sign of public health
A special place in this case is occupied by child mortality
The most sensitive to adverse factors are the organisms of mothers and children among all segments of the population
The main factors that shape children's health are:
Factors affecting parental health and constitution (especially those affecting mothers before pregnancy)
Genetic factors (affecting heredity)
Sanitary and hygienic nature of air water in soil
Power state
Family household factors: the description of the address in which the family lives, the average per capita income and the psychological climate of the family for childcare (smoking vodka - passion)
) presence
Sanitary and hygienic nature of Sadibing's conditions in preschool institutions
This grouping was made at the Research Institute of Social Hygiene and organizations of the Ministry of Health
Among these factors, especially as a result of pregnancy and childbirth, the impact on newborn health and infant life in the first year of life is studied in more detail.
For example, it was noted that children have a lower body weight (less than 2500 g) most often in young (under 18 years old) and elderly (over 35 years old) mothers.
They also have high rates of perinatal mortality and pregnancy complications
Children's body weight is also affected by mothers' improper nutrition before and during pregnancy on preterm birth and increased actual mortality
The uncontrolled use of various drugs by the mother adversely affects not only the growth of the infant in the abdomen, but also its subsequent development
Twice to work mothers 100 g
children with reduced weight of vodka increase the risk of birth
Breastfeeding and healthy eating are important factors affecting children's health
In subsequent years, in many advanced economies, the number of students with increased body weight increases (over 200%)
The causes of this phenomenon require more in-depth study, as do other hazards.
There is a lot of information about the impact of the socio-economic status of parents on the health of children with an educational level
Child health indicators are particularly dependent on the family status of young children
The incidence of children in single-parent families is steadily higher than in single-parent families and the number of children with frequent illnesses prevails
Such a difference will deepen with age
In children of parents who have not married, their health deteriorates, most often they have a premature month-day, and the end is formed later than the speech time, among such children more frequent and chronic diseases can be noticed.
Complications of chronic diseases of children in unreliable families are often repeated and their severe duration is observed
Apparent correlation between child health and agenda identified
Students who have a poor health rate of 1 hour or less per day in the open air are more likely to suffer from an eye refraction abnormality than children who follow this procedure, except for rheumatism and metabolism disorders
The spread of acute respiratory diseases among children is mainly directly related to the acceleration of the area of ​ ​ educational rooms and the planning of the building
Under the leadership of Serdyukovskaya, a factor analysis of the multidimensional "child-environment" system was carried out, which revealed the influence of about 80 indicators that affect the formation of morbidity in schoolchildren
The following factors affecting the health of students were identified here: climatic features of the area; air pollution; poor sanitary and hygienic conditions (especially the increase in school capacity) insufficient area of ​ ​ classrooms in two shifts
c); the poor material level of the family; head of the mother's work; preschool kindergarten in the group of children with an extended agenda in the elementary class; father's drunkenness; High school workload; non-compliance, especially drowsiness;
Conditionally compiled classification of social and hygienic factors for practical purposes that have the greatest impact on the state and development of health of almost growing organisms
PSukharev):
Enabling factors:
best order of movement;
glazing;
proper balance nutrition;
a sound agenda;
compliance of environmental impact with hygienic standards;
hygiene skills and the right life
Adverse factors ("hazards"):
Insufficient or excessive need for movement;
violation of the individual agenda of educational processes;
failure to comply with hygienic requirements for game reading and labor actions;
deficiencies in catering;
lack of hygiene skills;
adverse psychological climate in the family and children's groups
At the same time, indicators of physical development make it possible to talk about the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures, as well as to determine the level of environmental impact on the body of children
Due to the fact that the degree of physical development of an individual child or collective is a valuable hygienic indicator, children and adolescents need to carry out anthropometric observations from birth to puberty
Therefore, when assessing physical development, it is necessary to study the body length and chest
Hip brachial shin circle with longitudinal diameter of different body parts in special deep studies of t
additionally measured
Assesses the physical development of the team by calculating the arithmetic average parameters of the main anthropometric characteristics of individual age groups and their changes
Individual assessment of the physical development of children is carried out in various ways:
Relationships of individual anthropometric parameters over a long time for this purpose at the very beginning
- index method applied
The number of such indices reached several tens
The simplest indices, in which different indices consisted of the number of different indicators, consisted of two indicators (body weight - height length and chest circle - growth length indices)
The calculation of indices was widely applied in previous times, since it was simple
The most common are Brock Pigne Ketle Gulda and Kaup Livi Rohrer, the Erisman index mentioned above, etc.
was
The body weight (kg) according to the Brock index that reached this time is 100 cm from the height length (cm)
For example, with a length of 170 cm, the body weight should be 70 kg
Pinier index or "numerical index" is equal to obtaining body mass and volume of the thoracic circle from the length of growth
It is believed that the smaller the index, the weaker the body
The abundance of indices is due to the fact that none of them gives satisfactory results
Their use became suspicious at the end of the XIX century
Their main disadvantage is that the indices do not take into account the unevenness of the length of children's organisms
Currently, the method of physical development indices is not used
Instead of index methods, a deviation from Sigma (physical development profile)
It was introduced in 1925 by the famous German anthropologist Rudolf Martin
It is carried out by comparing the parameters of physical development of individuals with the arithmetic averages of these parameters
The resulting difference divides the number by the mean square deviation of the corresponding signs and finds a deviation from sigma
Physical development is estimated by the volume of deviations from sigma
Graphic index is emphasized as the profile of each child
This approach is simple and plausible, but since all indicators of physical development are assessed separately and separately from each other, this approach in the Union of Soviets was not applied from keng
The same method Centile and percentile (Centum-hundred) are simple and convenient
One of the first to introduce this approach into medicine was American research scientists Sturoy and Meredith
In the first half of the 20th century, they created graphic percentage scales to estimate the thickness of the fat layer for chest and bare circles for body weight and height length
The basis of the centile analysis is such that all variants of any sign are placed in one row in magnitude, starting from the younger
Then all rows are divided into 100 percentile parts, the equal means of which are called P50-median
Each centile describes the percentage of the test parts
Procili are most often used
Dimensions of signs within P25-P75 refer to average
Disposable percentage schedules are very convenient for use and are widely used by anthropologists and pediatricians
But this approach, as well as the method of deviation from sigma, considers indicators of physical development without individual correlation with each other
The regression analysis (correlation) approach is based on the creation of a regression scale reflecting on which volume the body weight and thoracic circle changes when the length changes by 1 cm
This scale is a table of assessment of all personality parameters, by the volume of sigma regression you can make a general conclusion about each other about the development of giant physique
The Children and Adolescents Research Institute developed a special sample to quantify physical development on a regression scale
The model is divided into 5 growth length classes: from 1st to 2nd middle, above 3rd middle 4th class, above 5th class, where physique develops
There are 5 grades of assessment:
It is worth noting that so far none of the above methods of assessing physical development have received absolute support
None of them are without flaws
Centile approaches, such as the method of deviation from sigma, single-handedly consider the parameters of each other's physical development without the necessary connection
In the regression method, the height length is taken as the basis for the development of physique, and when selecting options for signs subordinate to it (body weight and chest circle), schoolchildren are characterized by one-sided frequency asymmetry that does not correspond to weighted correctness
These circumstances may lead to certain errors
Therefore, the boundaries of the "rationing" of subordinate signs in the assessment table for schoolchildren are expanded to M + 2
Expansion of the boundaries of Norma will reduce the specific proportion of students rated "excess body weight"
Student "overweight" between -1 and + 2 is not obese
Excess body weight of schoolchildren in growth conditions not only shows obesity, but to a certain extent is an indicator of muscle development
The real obesity for them is significantly beyond M + 20
This situation is confirmed by clinicians along with hygienists
To create standards, two main methods of research are used: a generalizing method (horizontal trimming) - a general examination and individualization of groups necessary for a relatively short period of time (longitudine or elongated) - observation of a child or children of a certain group for a long time.
Tempering refers to a system of procedures that increases the body's ability to withstand environmental factors, especially meteorological factors (special attenuation effect)
At the same time, hardening increases the degree of immunobiological resistance to various diseases, which increases the body's performance
Due to the consistent repetition of duration and strength of individual effects, hardening can be considered as a separate type of exercise
This situation defines the basic principles of regularity (gradual beginning and preservation of consistency)
It is very important to adapt children to meterological factors from an early age
Maintained by thermal control of body temperature stability released chemically and physically
The first is regulation of heat generation (metabolism), the second is regulation of heat supply
Temperature factors of the external environment affect the thermoreceptors of the skin (thermal cooling)
These receptors do not have uniform distribution in all areas of the body
The largest part is on the face skin, the smallest part is on the skin of the limbs
In subsequent years, the free end of the nervous system on the skin was talked about by a frequent impulse in the skin - cold sensitive threads
Pulses go from the receptor to the hypothalamus (the body's heat-regulating center)
Heat-regulating reactions, in turn, will be associated with metabolism and the motor environment of skeletal muscles, that is, with the heat-producing center
When body temperature is adjusted, the rate and volume of peripheral circulation change the amount of heat of the skin surface
Vascular expansion or constriction when exposed to temperature stimuli is regulated with the participation of the central nervous system
Reflex reactions at cold impact provide narrowing of vessels with reduction of heat release by 15-30%
Unconditional reflexes can also be launched, increasing heat production
The child's body is regulated by a thermoregulating system from the day of birth, but becomes inferior weak
Children's skin is larger than adults and saturated with capillaries
Due to the fact that the metabolic process occurs progressively than in adults, they are therefore prone to diseases arising from cold
For the proper development of the thermal control system, the body needs hardening, and some loads on these systems are not harmful to the child's body, on the contrary, are useful
Therefore, the process of hardening the body is based on the training of a thermoregulating apparatus
In childhood, especially in childhood and preschool periods, the chemical center of thermal control plays a very important protective role
The rate of skin-vascular reactions to cold stimuli increases with age, but there may be a small hardening procedure
Overload of receptor devices and blood reactions improves their activity and accelerates the improvement of the functional capabilities of the thermal control system
In addition to the known unconditional reflexes, conditional reflexes arise on their basis, deliberately triggering a system of thermal control of temperature effects in the body of children
The effectiveness of glazing depends on the following principles:
Sequence of procedures
Increasing the strength of stimuli
Consideration of individual features at the beginning of hardening depending on the age of health and the degree of hardening
Having children in the best heat condition
Correct mood of the child
The means of protecting children are mainly natural factors: solar air radiation
For their use in glazing, certain hygienic requirements are imposed
Air and water shall be clean and at a certain temperature
Air humidity and speed are also taken into account
The angle of solar radiation release should be a certain amount of dominance and duration of exposure
The effectiveness of physical education in general is correct only if two basic principles are observed: adjustment of daily motor activity in accordance with hygienic standards and availability of a general hygienic model of physical education
The correct standard of motor activity should ensure the fulfillment of three main requirements: the economical functioning of all body systems, their reliability and correct compliance with the response to environmental change
The criterion of the hygienic norm of age periods is considered to be the improvement of the child's personality and team health in the annual dynamics
Ranges of hygienic standards can be used depending on the individual characteristics of the growing body
The main forms of medical control:
Child Health Survey with Functional Capability
Systematic monitoring of physical education and health education
Carrying out sanitary control over places of physical education and health education
Health education for preschool workers and mothers of children
For the proper organization of physical education, the peculiarities of the growth and development of the child's body must be taken into account.
Features of energy and substance metabolism in a growing body
Since the child's body is constantly developing, metabolic processes undergo significant changes
The following features should be highlighted:
Growth in children is very intense, metabolism is more intense than in adults, and begins to slow down with age
The process of metabolism in the child's body should ensure the continuous development of cellular substances and lost energy costs, as well as tissues
Therefore, the process of assimilation in children is higher than the process of dissimilation, that is, anabolism is higher than catabolism
In the children's body, the proteins necessary for the construction of cells and tissues are progressively formed
Protein demand for a growing body is slightly higher than in adults, and the younger the child, the higher the protein demand
Lack of protein can inhibit growth process
Hydrocarbons along with energy activities in the child's body are plastic (formation of welding tissues of the cell wall, etc.
) carries out activities
Due to the high need for protein in a growing body, the decomposition of hydrocarbons occurs very intensively, so the organisms of young children have a very high need for hydrocarbons;
Fat exchange process becomes unstable in baby body
With a lack of hydrocarbon supply, the oil depot is quickly depleted
Fats, along with a source of thermal energy, protect the body from heat loss from organ injuries;
Unlike adults, children become hydrolabile, that is, their organisms quickly lose water
Because of this, the process of water exchange in the body of children is quickly disrupted, and the younger the child, the more water is required, the better this phenomenon manifests itself in boys than in girls;
Due to the progressive growth of bone tissues, the need for calcium in children is 15 times higher than in adults
Calcium in the bones is produced mainly in the form of phosphate salts, because of which the body together with calcium requires a parallel supply of phosphorus;
Phosphate salts in the bones are formed only in the presence of vitamin "D"
Lack of this vitamin causes rickets;
Due to the lack of iron in the composition of Amy milk in infants, the increased need for this trace element (various fruit and berry juices);
Since the development of organs and systems in the child's body is not completed, the metabolism process largely depends on the environment, especially proper nutrition
The bulk of metabolism in children is relatively higher than in adults, which suggests that oxidation processes in them are proceeding at a high rate
The amount of basic metabolism depends on the rate of growth of the child's age sex by their constitution (the intensity of metabolism in children is higher) for the period of the year (in the spring-summer period) and t.
depends
Rationality of children's nutrition is possible only with the correct organization of the order of nutrition
To do this, perform the following measures:
Meeting Power Times and Time Intervals
Physiological rationality of eating
Correct distribution of the balance of quantity and quality of food according to individual feeding time;
Nutritional status of children and nutritional order of children
When compiling a menu, the sanitary doctor should know the following basic rules:
The diet according to the age of children should correspond to the load on physical work of the need for food and energy obtained depending on the climate for the period of the year
Due to the increase in energy consumption in the summer, it is necessary to increase the calorie content of food by 10%;
The menu is calculated 3-5 times depending on the duration of children's institutions
The menu is drawn up depending on the main types of dishes approved for children's and youth institutions of each type
Meat and fish dishes for breakfast and lunch, and for dinner - dairy vegetables and cereals
The diet must have meat and dairy butter vegetable
The menu consists of various dishes
Types of dishes should not be repeated
In all institutions of the Medical Academy of Sciences, a two-week menu was created, based on a typical menu recommended by the Institute of Nutrition depending on local conditions
Two more menus will also be prepared - "summer" and "winter"
The determination of calories and the chemical composition of the diet is carried out according to special tables and instructions for baby food
On the basis of the daily menu, a varietal menu is compiled with a list of dishes for each period of food and mass and individual types of all these dishes
The menu of the sorting kitchen also indicates the number of children and workers eating (employees of preschool institutions eat only at noon, and in school boarding schools - in 3 periods)
In the absence of some dishes specified in the menu, it is allowed to replace them with products corresponding to the chemical composition using the table of interchangeable dishes
Complex dishes to improve digestive activity in the children's diet (rye bread porridge should contain foods rich in vitamin B)
The specific proportion of proteins in the diet will be stable in all periods of the year
Work on routine sanitary monitoring of children's institutions:
Quality control of incoming dishes and their transportation
Control over the storage status of dishes
Monitoring of compliance with the deadline for distribution of dishes
Control over cooking technology:
Quality control of finished dishes
Control of sanitary anti-epidemic behavior of the dining room and the procedure for cleaning dishes
Monitoring of personal hygiene by canteen workers
Food Diet Control
Healthy lifestyles - behavioral education designed to promote the health of a known population
A healthy lifestyle is a socio-economic category associated with the development of not only medical, but also industrial relations
Healthy lifestyle Choice of physical condition according to health, i.e. individual social cake and high hygienic culture of society as a whole
Orders that enhance the body's protective abilities and anti-organism are the correct hygienic order
Rational nutrition with good motor and motor activity with the correct use of various actions and rest to increase the body's protective ability, preservation of personal hygiene excitation, special attention to his health condition has a good environmental situation
influences
It should be borne in mind that children cannot create the necessary habitat for themselves
Therefore, the formation of such conditions depends mainly on teachers organizing educational work for parents
That is, the behavior of a child in the future will depend on the environment of his life from childhood
A healthy life is not combined with bad habits
Smoking on the uterus of alcohol and other substances leading to alcohol in every way prevents the formation of a healthy lifestyle
Harmful habits are considered a risk factor for many diseases and negatively affect the health of children and adolescents
Currently, epidemiological checks for high school students show that smoking wine use is still becoming more common among young people
Drunkenness comes out on top
The most difficult period prone to alcoholism is the teenage period
During this period, there are a number of important changes in the lives of adolescents
Firstly, the psycho-endocrine transformation of the body is formed, and secondly, the formation of new approaches begins
Psychological restructuring is difficult due to discamfort situations
The character of adolescents is characterized by instability and rapid painful ease
During this period, comrades will have a high need to create a group
At the same time, in the teenage group, ways are being formed to solve many difficult situations for leisure activities with their evaluation directions
Therefore, during this period, the risk of getting used to vodka together with groups increases, the comments of parents and teachers can be perceived as an objection to his right to freedom and often negatively affect their behavior
Therefore, forcing them to a unilateral hearing will lead to their unauthorized departure
All these cases are caused by the easy detection of alcoholic beverages and the widespread spread of alcoholic habits and traditions
A very funny comedian who is just starting to drink, quickly encounters alcohol groups who can quickly solve problems.
Flight from real life difficulties can lead children to alcohol groups
That is, dissatisfaction with basic actions (educational work)
From such situations, a very important psychological mechanism can be made: adolescents whose life problems could not cope with anxiety demonstrate their resistance to the norms and values ​ ​ that have developed with the transition to alcohol groups
Also violate contraindications to alcohol
An important direction in the prevention of bad habits is to increase the needs of a teenager in the formation of a person, special attention should be paid to the formation of an attitude to the moral cultural values ​ ​ of mankind, that is, the spiritual health of a teenager
Carrying out anti-alcohol educational work among adolescents refers to a special preventive approach against alcohol
Anti-alcohol education in schools should be guided by low principles:
Formation of school students from an early age for anti-alcohol education
Since the individual approach to alcohol begins to take shape at 9-10 years old, anti-alcoholic education should begin from primary school;
Anti-alcohol education and education should go consistently in the same direction; according to the age of the student, starting with a simple example, it is necessary to disclose the harm of alcohol by explaining what it causes both in society and in connection with alcohol;
planning of antitumor work according to phases and stages laid down among children;
Taking into account the mental characteristics of different age groups of students in anti-alcohol work;
The work of educating students against alcohol should be consistent with hygienic and familiar emotional and meaningful aspects;
Organization of full leave to increase the social and hygienic activity of children;
complex implementation of anti-alcohol works
It is beneficial for pedagogical teams to carry out such work with families together with specialist doctors, including drug addicts, non-state organizations;
active intervention of high school students in anti-alcohol work
Creation of antitumor educational works for them
Such works are elementary with high school students
it will also be useful for classroom students
Because high school students trust high school students more than their parents and teachers
In a teenage audience, lectures on the harm of alcohol to internal organisms are not very effective
In such environments, anti-alcohol work should be aimed at opening up opportunities for children and adolescents in the necessary diaries, that is, to find their place in society among children in the family
The content of antitumor work should be based on a deep understanding that correctly covers the needs of the human child
The healthy lifestyle of children largely depends on the environment in which parents are brought up
The development of a healthy lifestyle for children and adolescents will be effectively carried out taking into account their well-known age-sexual collective characteristics
Since most of the world's peoples are children and adolescents, proper attention to them is an important task of this society
The proper upbringing of children can be seen as their proper attention
90% of education is formed at a very early age
Hygienic knowledge and hygienic skills not only strengthen the health of the child, but also introduce the child to ethics
The introduction of the child to the requirements of personal hygiene forms their conscious compliance with the basic rules necessary for society
The basics of a child's hygienic upbringing begin in kindergarten, then deeper explanations are given at school
Its main features are:
Teaching hygiene in the educational process mainly
Carrying out out out-of-school sanitary voluntary work of schoolchildren
Out-of-school health education with students
Sanitary whitewashing by parents
is
In addition, hygiene education for children and adolescents is a mandatory part of the school curriculum
Hygiene Education Programme
In general, the hygienic education programme for students consists of the following requirements:
The importance of physical culture and hardening in health care
Mental health of schoolchildren
Nutrition hygiene
Public and personal hygiene
Injury prevention
Polytechnic training hygiene
Sex education
The most important in this area is the allocation of the necessary topics for the age of schoolchildren
The age dimensions of children are divided into 3 generally accepted groups:
children 7-9 years old (grades 1-3);
children 10-14 years old (grades 4-7);
Teenagers 15-17 years old (grades 8-1)
The principle of hygienic education of students in departments corresponding to their age sizes
The older the children, the deeper the meaning of the first ideas about hygienic education
The topic of physical education includes information about the correctness of an individual
Here they will get acquainted with the benefits of physical and motor exercises that contribute to the formation of recreational hormanism
An important hygienic skill is the adaptation to the creation of children's morning gymnastics exercises.
Mental health topics include reading and sleep hygiene in home and school
Children, depending on age, should know the most correct duration of their agenda elements, be able to use it correctly in life
Schoolchildren from the age of 10 should draw up a convenient agenda for themselves
High school students should have an idea of ​ ​ the physiological significance of exhaustion and severe exhaustion and an idea of ​ ​ the dynamics of mental abilities during the year per week
Students of all ages should correctly assess the condition and duration of night sleep
Nutrition hygiene of young children consists in the ability to use a napkin
Here, without haste, they accustom to skills not to be distracted when eating
In adulthood, schoolchildren receive information on quantitative and qualitative nutritional standards, digestive mechanisms of minerals and vitamins
Trauma is one of the main causes of death of children and adolescents
The preventive importance of proper hygienic education of students in this case is very great
In this mode, teaching schoolchildren (primary and secondary classes) traffic rules is the main goal
Cases of his falling from balconies from stairs made of shrubs to prevent injuries in school and everyday life electric gas stoves with scissors dining room
discussed errors in misuse of items
T for nasal hemorrhage in burns, when school students, starting from a low grade, when cutting a flammable injury
are trained in first aid methods in an environment
Many researchers believe that maintaining a daily routine and the main hygiene of a healthy lifestyle and abandoning bad habits increases life expectancy by 7-10 years
Non-compliance with the Decais main hygiene rules has an adverse effect not only on the individual, but also on persons in close relationships (copper)
infectious diseases)
School students should have knowledge and skills on personal hygiene
Pre-school and primary school children should be taught and taught the following techniques:
on time (after visiting the toilet before eating and playing with animals)
) thoroughly wash;
washing the body to markings and legs;
keeping hair and nails clean;
properly ventilate rooms
Educates middle and high school students on infectious diseases and preventive measures against them
The basis of hygienic education for training in the professional profession is to explain to students the danger in industrial processes at work lessons
Knowledge of sanitary and hygienic behaviour in children's and teenage classrooms
Prevention of occupational injuries in high school
School students should be able to use the tools correctly when choosing special clothes of the height of the verstak corresponding to their age
Girls have skills in applying delicacy machine hygiene requirements to food preparation and storage conditions
All young people should pay special attention to technical safety
On hygienic issues in the sexual education of middle-class students
Including before the appearance of physiological changes in children, messages about sex education are transmitted
Gender-based concepts are applied to girls aged 12 years and to boys at 13 years
Educational work will be carried out to develop proper behaviour skills for high school adolescents, both medically and morally
The widespread use of tobacco and the addiction of adolescents to this bad habit is one of the most important issues of medicine
On this issue, a number of laws and educational measures have been developed on the basis of comprehensive research by the Health Education Research Institute.
European Regional Bureau of the All-Union Health Organization shows that the age of smokers increases from year to year
In this regard, if today acquaintance with noise begins in children not only in adolescence, but also at 10-12 years old, then hygienic education of children and adolescents for the harmful effects of smoking is a mandatory measure
Not only the younger generation with data on the impact of tobacco smoke on human health, but also adults themselves are not fully aware
Harmful health effects of tobacco smoke:
Smokers are more likely to suffer from circulatory diseases (athersclerosis angina hypertension myocardial infarction) than smokers
Each strained tobacco leads to a constriction of the vessels to 20-30 minutes;
Nicotine affects the human nervous system
First, the center excites the brain, and then weakens;
Smoking disrupts metabolism and vitamin uptake in the body
Most tobacco passions have avitaminosis
Nicotine promotes inflammation of the digestive tract by causing inflammatory processes of the creamy layer of the stomach
98% of the incidence of stomach ulcer are smokers;
Nicotine reduces sex hormone production and sexual activity
Consensus found in tobacco smoke
Lung and stomach cancer occurs several times more often in smokers than in non-smokers;
Currently, the issue of alcoholism is one of the most pressing
The misuse of alcoholic beverages was realized in early times, and it has now been proved through numerous scientific studies
Alcohol has a negative effect on the body at all stages of its development from the moment the infant is in the abdomen:
It has been proven that 90 out of 100 children with low mental development were fertilized while intoxicated
Congenital defects of alcohol intoxication of pregnant women (congenital heart defect)
) leads to an increase in numbers
Alcoholic central nervous system distorts the effects of drugs affecting the renal heart of the liver, reducing performance and mental well-being
The cause of more than 30% of car accidents is alcohol drinking
Drunks are twice as likely to get sick when they do not drink vodka
In previous times and at present, various restrictions and laws against alcoholism have been adopted
The very active work on hygienic education of the younger generation with low sanitary literacy of workers in youth institutions and parents cannot give the necessary effectiveness
The correct solution to this issue is carried out through hygienic education of children and adolescents - indirect, that is, the impact on their parents
This work should be carried out from the moment of primary patronage of the child upon reaching his life
During the morning reception from the day of the kindergarten visit, a conversation or briefing is held at group and general parent meetings
It is important to have personal conversations with parents without sanitary literacy
The importance of this work will be high, especially in cases of acute intestinal diseases in preschool institutions
Open-door conferences and screenings with parent lectures and conversations with visual tools
Employees of children's and youth institutions: heads of directors and teachers of preschool institutions, heads of health camps, canteen workers and technical workers must undergo mandatory hygienic training

Experience in applying genetic and mathematical methods to the interpopulation difference of small sandstones
In the course of work in two populations of small sandstones on the Volga in the Ural and Caspian sand foci of the plague, separate sandstones were identified with a level of blood catalysis in population genetic measurements
In the population of small kumysh inhabiting the right and left banks of the Volga River, in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg law, a quantitative change in the generic form and allelic frequency was revealed
Using statistical analysis (X), a significant difference between the controlled and expected frequency geneticists of small sandstones in the Volga - Uralsk sand was proved
Adaptation of genotypes to this rodent population is calculated
Based on the data obtained, a view on the right bank of the Volga River was selected, which leads to stabilization of the equilibrium of the heterozygate frequency, to which the population of small sandstones is most adapted
The frequency of the Allele was discovered, in which the Volga - Uralsk keep two alleles in the sand population
frequency equilibrium: pe = 0444 i qe = 0556
For this population, the genetic load value L = 0448 is calculated
Rodent population resistance to adverse environmental conditions is not associated with normal blood catalase levels
The sand population on the left bank is represented by the genotype species AA
In the left-bank population, a koryut was created that the appearance of allenes can occur only during mutation or during the resettlement of sandstones accompanying the allele genotype on the front bank
In two sunflower populations, a calculation of genetic similarity and genetic distance by blood catalase locus is given: 1 = 0636 i D = 0453
Genetic distance of genetic similarity to natural choice of Hardy - Weinberg substance
Arid zone anthropogenic factor desert natural erosion landscape
Sands (30 million) are the main natural factor contributing to desertification in Kazakhstan.
ha) and saline land (127 million
ha) is the internal continental position of the country, determining the land and aridity of the climate, leading to widespread, poverty and even distribution of water resources
Conditions for the development of land absorption processes are created when seasonal features of soil formation are disturbed by drought
Also a prerequisite for desertification is the weak compactness of the soil and vegetation cover and its dynamics
These natural features of Kazakhstan are known for the weak resistance of the natural environment to anthropogenic impacts (according to available data, about 75% of the country's territory are exposed to a high threat of environmental destabilization) [1]
Anthropogenic facet nets leading to the emergence and development of desertification processes in Kazakhstan are associated primarily with the following economic activities: grazing; agriculture; development of subsoil; construction and commissioning of watering and linear devices of industrial military and civilian facilities
Desertification is also the result of the impact of transport on the non-systemic recreation of forest and steppe fires on the feed and firewood of unpredictable mass logging and logging of shrubs and shrubs, soil and groundwater pollution in human settlements
The main type of desertification in Kazakhstan, determined in accordance with the criteria adopted in the Convention to Combat Desertification, was: plant uptake; aquatic and windy soil erosion; salinization and soil graininess; chemical contamination of soil groundwater and groundwater; man-made violations of land and hydrological regime
Vegetation uptake is the most common and externally defined process of forest desertification, expressed as the uptake of grazing land and hayfields
The estimated forestry of the republic is 46% when only trees are included in the forest, including saxaul woodlands and shrubs, the actual forestry is 23%
Decrease in forest density over the last 10 years from 052 to 047 i.e. by 10%
Reduced forest cover and reduced volumes of artificial forestry by Kyzylkum Moyynkum Saryesik - Atyrau and other areas pose a catastrophic threat to the growth of the reduction and absorption of pastures in the predominant desert part
In the forests of Rudny and Southern Altai, 40 areas of fir trees have decreased, the yield of coniferous forests over the past 13% of years has decreased by 7%, tree degradation is most noticeable
The area of ​ ​ apple forests growing in the Dzungar and Ili Alatau decreased by 24%
Forests in the floodplain of desert rivers swallow very heavily
Reduced soil humidity due to the regulation of river currents in these forests leads to unnecessary changes in species
For example, about a third of turanga trees in the Syr Darya River massif of the Shardarinsky district of the South Kazakhstan region have become unnecessary shrubs
Absorption of pastures and hayfields
Massive surge of virgin lands had more negative and complex impact on steppe ecosystem of Kazakhstan
The more pastures, the greater the loading of pastures in the rest of the virgin state due to the displacement of livestock to low-productive places, as well as an increase in the number of livestock
Most of the fertile land was displaced and accumulated by cattle to a low-productive non-channeled solonetzic territory, including the litter of the lake and wet weed grasslands of the basins [2]
According to the Land Administration Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as of November 2004, 1889 million.
266 million.
having reached it, he demonstrates a strong and very strong desert
348 million tenge of lands of forest-steppe and steppe zones of the republic
of which 56 million hectares are pastures
very strongly swallowed ha
There is an increasing trend in pasture uptake
50 million tenge of Kazakhstan
hayfields are available in the ha area
When hayfields are reduced due to desertification, their suppression by poisonous plants shows complete or partial disappearance in the reproduction of shrubs, not only the resource, but also the water-regulating role of meadow plants
Wind and water erosion of soils
In Kazakhstan, desert-steppe dry desert semi-desert and desert landscapes caused by wind erosion of soil
Under the influence of wind erosion, thin soil particles overflew and soil backfills
The content of karachyrin in the wind layers of sown land decreases, the volume of absorption decreases, carbonate increases, agrochemical and water-physical properties deteriorate
To date, in Kazakhstan, it is possible to predict the weakness of deflation in crops due to its reduction
However, in the arid regions of the republic, especially in heavily absorbed pastures, there is a danger of increased terrestrial erosion
During the implementation of the program for the expansion of irrigated land, extensive areas of pumping and salt soils were involved in irrigation
The main cause of regional water and environmental problems in volume irrigation remains the misuse of water, which is on average one step higher than the specific water consumption in other countries in such natural conditions where there is no shortage.
This is due to the lack of economic stimulus and a tradition of saving aquifer technologies
Uneconomical filtration and irrigation standards of 3op became the main cause of wetland and water erosion of secondary salinity, and sewage discharges led to pollution of rivers with fertilizers and pesticides and high mineralization
The consequences of the disaster led to the pollution of the Amudaria Syr Darya and Ili rivers and the violation of the water balance
Their influence also affected the complex of environmental and economic problems of Balkhash and Aral region
Environmental tension in the Aral region is one of the most tragic events of this century
Protection against frivolous networks from the southern deserts became a favorable influence on the natural-climatic and ecological conditions of the marine surrounding regions located in the center of the desert, and a regulator of humidity in the vast territory of the Aral region
Marine fish farming with high biological productivity was of important transport and recreational importance
As a result of extensive use of the water resources of the Amudaria and Syr Darya rivers, the sea was divided into two reservoirs - the Big and KIS and the Island
The autumn floodplain of the rivers has decreased, and many coastal lakes rich in fauna and flora have dried up.
air humidity by 10-18% decreased by 30-35 days in the frost-free period
Only as a result of salinization and wetland in the Syr Darya River basin, 10-15% of irrigated land from agricultural turnover is released annually
Pasture yields decreased by 2-3 times and crop yields decreased
Aral trouble has great socio-economic and environmental consequences
An emergency sanitary and epidemiological situation has developed in the areas of Aral production, where the number of infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis viral hepatitis, as well as oncological diseases, has increased over the past 15-20 years.
Similar problems may arise in the Balkhash Metallurgical Plant
Extraordinary negative consequences of mass regulation of the hydrographic network
For the purpose of watering crops on pastures irrigated without milking hydrological bases and irrigated animals, a large number of dams have been built at the mouths of river basins and small rivers, preventing some part of the pasture flow
Part of the reserve vessel was used rationally - due to the filter and leakage into the underground flow
Many lakes have dried up - their household and drinking fish farming and recreational manga have irrationally increased the mineralization of water
On lakes and small rivers that have lost a significant part of the surface runoff, the process of self-treatment of water has weakened and the concentration of municipal and industrial pollutants has increased
The reduction of intensive floods on ordered rivers led to the absorption of grazing ecosystems, a decrease in the yield of fertile hayfields and salinization of floodplain soils
Dehumilisation and sorting of soils
Dehumification process recorded in all pastures and pastures
Carachyrin reduction is associated with irreversible nutrient release by harvesting
Loss of karachevets in irrigated soils occurs as a result of irrigation erosion while regulating the flow and desertification of the surrounding area in river reservoirs
Due to dehumification from the total territory of non-irrigated pastures at a weak level - 45 medium - 52 and above - 15 million.
settles on ha
Irrigation share of irrigated land $07 million
is ha [3]
A feature of Kazakhstan is the aridity of soils during drought of lakes and other reservoirs
Halting or accelerating the reduction of irrigation leads to an increase in the level of lowering of groundwater, as well as to a change in the hydrological regime of drying and desertification of soil
Soil and groundwater pollution
Chemical contamination of soils and special substances from chemical processing of agricultural land in the last two decades has greatly increased the risk of placing industrial waste for the discharge of atmospheric wastewater into cities and industrial centers
The soil is also polluted by the runoff of livestock complexes
Groundwater pollution is very common in Kazakhstan and, due to its impact, is considered as a factor: desertification of land, secondary salinization of soils by plants! deterioration of drinking water supply
Mining and processing enterprises, other industries with chemical and toxic waste, livestock complexes, urban agglomerations, etc.
forms the greatest pollution
Man-made desertification
The development of industrial production in Kazakhstan and the development of mineral deposits were accompanied by the construction of transport and engineering infrastructure with direct and indirect negative impact of water and land resources on ecosystems with accelerated production and pollution
In addition to these effects, there are cases of direct effects of toxic industrial emissions on plants, which have had a significant impact on the processes of man-made desertification, the release of toxic substances into the air basin
The system of roads also has a man-made effect
In the republic, their total range is 100 thousand km, of which half is covered by pavement, that is, for 1 km of the territory there are 0036 km of public road, and with pavement - 0017 km
With the general availability of off-road vehicles, their extremely rare network led to irregular traffic, as a result of which irregular roads became one of the factors of desert
Of the other types of network infrastructure that have an impact on the environment, high-voltage electric networks of oil and gas railways should be noted.
Special forms of man-made desertification are reflected within the territory of space military and former nuclear test sites, which currently occupy 6% of the territory of the Republic
At the same time, their impact zone will be significantly increased if the missile flight route is included in it
The negative impact of landfills, with the exception of direct land removal, is reflected in large volumes of oxygen combustion in spills of superheavy rocket fuel in the performance of launches in the atmosphere when fragments of parts of non-combustible missiles and parts of other aircraft fall and on the destruction of the ozone layer at the time of launch of the rocket
One of the main negative effects of desertification is the absorption of biodiversity, which occurs both through the total death of local populations of species, as well as through the reduction of their habitat and abundance, as well as due to phytocenative activity and reduced reproductive abilities.
The animal world of the republic has undergone significant changes under the influence of anthropogenic factors leading to desertification
The fauna of spider birds of surface and soil insects was very badly affected. mammals and other animals
About 80% of the territory of the regional steppe fauna in the northern regions of the republic was liquidated
A similar situation has developed in the Tian Shan field belt and in its foothills, where many species of insect phytophages, predatory and parasitic limbs of wild bees pollinating plants, and many species of mammals and mammals have disappeared.
Taukum Moyynkum Saryesik-Atyrau and other deserts in the foothills of the Tien Shan of the Dzungar Alatau and the Tarbagatai highlands reduced the habitat of many animal species (including unique species)
Major changes have occurred in fauna in military sites near major industrial cities and in mining areas [4]
Desertification has affected plant uptake
Vegetation disturbance is associated with man-made impacts and unregulated wintering roads near villages and along cattle trails in the northern deserts, with the exception of overgrazing in the middle and southern deserts
Over the years, Kazakhstan's forests have been heavily absorbed
In North-West Kazakhstan, this affected, first of all, coniferous forests - in desert zones, in mountain regions to saxaulas
In Northern Tian Shan and Dzungar Alatau, there is a change in species of mountain forests and a change in borders
Desertification of hayfields caused a strong anthropogenic pressure of the intensive process
Especially strong changes in hayfields occurred on the slopes of the Ile Syr Darya and Shu rivers and in the lower reaches of the floodplain
High-performance reed associations are fully absorbed here
Desertification has had a number of economic and social consequences:
reduced yield and gross output of plant products; reduced livestock numbers and livestock productivity;
reducing the export potential of the agricultural sector;
halting the development of food and light industry;
Accelerated reduction of tax revenues from the agrarian and processing sectors
degradation of natural areas related to tourism
The development of tourism contributes to the development of desertification in the territory of the Republic as a result of land degradation and the growth of drought
Statistics reflect negative trends in the economy of the agricultural sector
They are known for the most difficult multi-level reform and restructuring, but the process of desertification leaves an independent negative labelling of the productivity of resources throughout the Republic, and in developed regions desertification is a priority cause of economic tension [5]
Lack of new forms of management, disruption of the grazing system, lack of technical and financial instruments increases unemployment and poverty
Current social situation in Kazakhstan is connected with the following conditions: annual migration of population from desert regions reaches hundreds of thousands of people
The low standard of living of the population resulting from environmental imbalance and habitat degradation has led to a decrease in population growth, which is a prerequisite for demographic disadvantage for the rapid deterioration of the health status of the population, in which medical care for drinking water and salt storms is unsuitable for use

Grazing environment conditions
As stated in the content of the Convention to Combat Desertification, issues such as desertification of sub-humid land and dryland are raised as a result of human actions and climate change and other factors
The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan adopted the Programme to Combat Desertification in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2005-2015 from 3 February 2004
Within the framework of this action, which received great support at the republican level, the issue of combating desertification has become relevant
Therefore, as a unique issue in the indigenous study of environmental problems, giving increased importance to concepts such as soil cover, such as vegetation cover, it has become advisable to continue to carry out fundamental enbeks and research based on qualitative methods of their study and the experiments and tools of leading specialists in accordance with the modern and developed needs of science and education.
In the geobotanical literature, there is much information on classifications of dynamic processes occurring in the plant cover, among which the most significant authors of I.
Alekhinnin (1935) B
These include the slopes of Bykovta (1957) [1]
In geobotanical science in the Kenes era
The classification of suckage is applied from ore, which is based on the causes of changes and the consequences of their occurrence
Research in this direction was first commissioned in 1915
In the last Sukachev classification (1954), which determined endodynamic changes (syngenetic and endoecogenetic), exodynamic (exogenetic) hologenetic and philocenetic [1] classifications were presented
Division of successions into centuries and separate by pace of development
Towards age-old changes
Sukachev (1928) gave the phylogenetic name P.
Yaroshenko (1953 1961) proposed the name "general changes"
Individual changes (P
Yaroshenko (1953 1961) was previously called linear successions (Gams 1918)
Short-term changes of Ramensky (1938 1952)
Lavrenko 1940), who proposed the name neocenogenesis neogenesis (V)
The vast majority of information on the legality of the transition of plant associations used in our various plant formations is obtained using indirectly conducted methods, from which the method of establishing successional connections based on a number of transition communities at the mine (ecological and phytocenotic)
Study of phytocenosis transition pattern in the mine largely reflects changes over time [1 327 b
Within exodynamic successions, climatogenic edaphogenic zoogenic and anthropogenic transitions should be correctly distinguished
At the same time G
For Lavrenko, it is important to use the classification of change
Plant cover undergoes radical changes under the influence of the evolution of the change resulting from the climatogenic transition
In describing these changes, it is also necessary to attach importance to the temporal phenomena that may arise as a result of meteorological changes.
Edaphogenic transitions include the shifting of plant growth, such a change of which, as a rule, is directly affected by a change in soil composition
Most of them develop over a long period, accordingly, narrow slowly, and sometimes double salting of the soil leads to evaporation of sand, changes its mechanical composition and accelerates the process
The results of the anthropogenic change of various actions of human activity today have become the main cause of large-scale changes in vegetation cover
Endogenous transition includes successions resulting from spontaneous growth of plant association (change of salinity regime in soil and t
) determine the species that make up the composition of plants that arise under the influence of
On the example of studies of Pachoskia, it was found that the complete absence of grazing land in the vicinity of Mount Karatengiz negatively affected the growth of vegetation cover
The results of the studies showed that pastures have a complex effect on the vegetation cover, namely: microclimate changes the ecology and structure of associations, in turn, the level of productivity of pasture lands decreases
Snowy soil not only affects the xerophytization of the vegetation cover, but also leads to changes in the forms necessary for the growth of the vegetation cover
It is significant that as a result of a decrease in herbaceous species and phytocenotic effects, the number of coniferous shrubs and shrubs increases
Under the influence of pastures, the seasonal rhythm of the plant also changes
In the event of a sharp reduction in the rhythmic types of development of the past year under the influence of the grazing regime, it was found that at the same time the number of Late Cretaceous and morning species of fairy-tale species increases [2]
A large amount of grass cover is eliminated during one season in pastures
If the plant is consumed annually, that is, annually, then its ability to withstand the grazing process decreases, as a result of a sharp decrease in growth intensity, fodder reserves decrease [2]
The main thesis of geobotany, which does not require evidence, is that the state of vegetation cover directly depends on the state of the natural environment
However, this dependence does not have the same places in all natural and climatic zones, which affects the change in vegetation cover in the land management of this settlement
Mirkin Rosenberg (1978) Nitsenko (1948) and
Vasilevich believes that the connection of vegetation cover with the environment affects the diversity of changes in the climate zone and climatic region
"The relationship between habitat and vegetation diversity may be functional
With a low level of differences in this connection, the relationship becomes correlative, considering small differences in the environment, we see that there is practically no connection between them
Changes in vegetation cover are associated with changes in soil composition, but this does not mean anything, since most often it can be associated with independent factors, for example, with snow accumulability and t.
Diversity in phytocenosis change according to the emergence of growth cycles is associated with the main changes in three local types: aging and death of plant species can be attributed to the services of wind supplements
It is allowed to be included in the internal successional classification, since this applies to work on restoration of vegetation cover in places of destruction
The difference in successions arising from the transition of the time of simple successions does not include many areas [1]
Phytocenosis changes throughout the year are different
All phytocenosis cubes have changed in different years
In dry years, the level of hayfields in meadows and mountains decreases (the number of prosperous crops decreases, the growth rate of mountain crops and t worsens
Sometimes synusions occur, for example, if ephemeral synusis occurs in decrees, droughts fall in spring after a small winter
Changes in different phytocenoses are different
Different changes correspond to amplitude, for example, some species affect weather changes, and some phytocenoses are subject to changes so much that the same type of phytocenosis can be similar to other types of phytocenoses
Changes in phytocenoses in different years directly depend on fluctuations in weather amplitude and soil humidity
In this regard, the plant undergoes significant changes in coverage, since the plant feeds only on atmospheric precipitation, and the amount of precipitation varies per year
On the contrary, the soil, that is, with maximum humidification by groundwater while ensuring a stable and uniform supply of moisture, the vegetation cover retains characteristic features even in conditions of atmospheric drought [1]
As far as the grazing ecosystem has changed since the first state, it is possible to determine the level of biodiversity and nutrition of wild animals by insects and pets
Pets and wild animals are the main consumers of phytomass, which means they directly participate in soil-forming processes, participate in the active exchange of energy and substances involved in changing the biogeocenotic cover of soils, and in the periodic change and change of edements in biogeocenosis
At the same time, the implementation of the main complex biogeochemical functions contributes to zoogenic secretion
The effect of animals, grazing pastures for agricultural purposes, on the vegetation cover causes a zoogenic shift of association, such as the activities of wild animals that have a negative impact on ecosystems
However, the pace of development and the scale of zoogenic successions does not grow at the hypertrophic level
In this case, the dynamic capabilities of the system are subject to excessive change, and sometimes even (grazing on excessive pastures) harm natural conditions and not only negatively affect its (fluctuational) natural circulation of substances.
In this case, it can be determined that the resulting changes do not fall into the category of changes occurring at the zoogenic or natural level, but have undergone anthropogenic succencial changes [1]
Issues related to the transformation of vegetation cover in anthropogenic condition (pastoral man-made changes, etc.
) increases relevance
Without this, the winding of grass from desert lands leads to the transformation of the plant into a desert in an automorphic ecosystem
Over the centuries, the prevailing situations in desert anthropogenic grassland systems have become a self-regulatory system
The vegetation cover in some desert pastures is not used very weakly or at all as intensive hayfields, due to the fact that mass desert flour is covered on the soil surface, which in turn reduces the growth of other plant species, that is, to the process of species exchange and biological productivity of the territory
The main common condition of aging is considered dynamic study of all components of the medium in the investigated zone
The ability to conduct dynamic research not only in relation to the vegetation cover, but also to distinguish in evolution the homogeneous geosystem and history of the development of the studied object
The most common type of anthropogenic desert in the deserts of Kazakhstan includes degradation of the vegetation cover
Total vegetation cover is considered an indicator giving high dynamic changes that occurred due to the creation of the main component in the landscape
By researching and describing the vegetation cover, you can not only understand the changes in the state of the environment, but also create a forecast of future changes [4]
Kurochkina noted that the assessment of degradation conditions in Central Asia did not adopt uniform criteria for assessing total degradation, noting in some terms contradictions
The calculation of desertification indicators includes the current forestry conditions of agricultural land, these data are usually presented in the annual report of the statistical office
Including wind erosion (deflation), which is the main cause of land degradation, including as a result of the difference in pastures, etc.
indicators not set out
However, the indicators in the reports do not determine the state of land degradation [5]
We are talking about flood emergencies in the river basin
Syr darya originates in the eastern part of the Ferghana basin and flows into the Aral Sea from the Karadaria and Naryn rivers, large rivers of Central Asia
The length of the Naryn River is 2212 km, the catchment area is 3019 km ² 219
Water in the upper part is more used to irrigate crops in the Ferghana Valley, so the water of many industries does not reach the main canal
Main areas: on the left - Isfairam Shahimardan Soh Isfara Kozhabokulgan Aksu; right - King ata Kasansai Gavasai
The Aral Sea massif is rarely located in the desert zone
Only the Syr Darya River flows through the territory of Kazakhstan
The Syr Darya River originates in the mountains of Central Tien Shan outside Kazakhstan
In the upper reaches of the valley of the Arys and Keles rivers, the total length of the river is 2212 km, of which 1400 km flows in Kazakhstan land along sandy valleys
In 10 years alone, as a result of subvention in the republic, 10 thousand people died and 15 million people were injured, the total damage amounted to 300 billion US dollars
Syr Darya River massif in Kyzylorda region is located on the territory with moisture deficit occupied by artificial irrigation of sown areas
The main consumer of water in the river massif is irrigated agriculture, increasing demand for water every year
At the same time, there is demand for water in terms of industrial services and fisheries
The work on regulating river runoff under the conditions of the Syrdarya river warehouse is of significant importance in the water economy
The useful ordered flow here is about 260 km3 10 million.
19 reservoirs of area m3 (main reservoirs are given in Table 1)
Figure 1 - View on the map of Kazakhstan of the zones of the Syr Darya River with flood waters
The work on regulating river runoff under the conditions of the Syrdarya river warehouse is of significant importance in the water economy
Here about 260 km3	10 million.
19 reservoirs of area m3 (main reservoirs are given in Table 1)
To form river tributaries in the Republic of Kazakhstan along the Syrdarya River Canal, a long-term ordered district reservoir of 195 km3, built in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan in 1974, has a significant impact
To form the runoff of the Syrdarya channel, according to the given list, one can name the largest area of ​ ​ 195 km3 and the Kairakkum reservoirs, which uniformly affect the filling of the Toktagul and Shardarin reservoirs operating in energy order
Currently, the process of water movement in winter (December-February) has been disrupted
The movement of water from the Toktagul reservoir to Kyrgyzstan with energy needs in August increased the flow rate for advancement to 300 m3/s and in winter to 700 m3/s (usually in the normal mode the flow rate does not exceed 100-200 m3/s)
Taking into account the operation of all reservoirs located in Uzbekistan, it has been proved that the flow rate for their movement is 1100 m3/s.
The time of the flood wave from the Shardarin reservoir to the border of the Kyzylorda region will be 5-7 days to the city of Kyzylorda - 12-14 days to the territory of the Kazalinsky district about 40 days
Water consumption in the Syr Darya River decreased in the winter period after the completion of the Shardarin reservoir
However, after the transition of the Tokhtagul and Shardarin reservoirs to the energy regime, the winter flow to the Shardarin reservoir quickly increased
Displacement of the volume of water in the Syrdarya Canal in winter in large quantities from the maximum capacity leads to flooding. Flooding of settlements in violation of barriers against all operating rules for irrigation canals or tons
promotion suffered significant material losses
Water management issue in Kyzylorda rgn is in difficult situation
Total number of residents of Kyzylorda region included in flooding zone will exceed 150 thousand people
The maximum importance is the increase of water flow and the need for agriculture in May-June of all stages of control
When the flood period occurs, the threat of flooding can penetrate the territory of the following zones: Aral district - 10 thousand ha Kazalinsky district - 15 thousand ha Karmakshinsky district - 98 thousand ha Zhalagash district - 25 thousand ha Syrdarya district - 6 thousand ha Shieli district - 5 thousand ha Zhanakoragai district - 5 thousand ha Land plots of summer cottages "Yagodka" "Kommunalnik" on the outskirts of the city
At the same time highways Samara-Shymkent 1045 to 1046 km 1650-1651 km 1974-1978 km 1986-1987 km; Kyzylorda-Zhosaly 21-22 km 101-104 km; Zhanakorgan-Kargalinsky 22-23 km; Kazaly-Kaukei 63-68 km; Kamyshlybash-Gingg 11-13 km Shieli-Kargaly 16-19 km
Railway sections at risk of flooding 3072 km 3023-3024 km 2258 km 2794 km 2806 km 2820 km 2735 km 2792 km 2762 km 2442 km 2456-2457 km
Railway bridges located in flooded areas - 3100 km 3067 km 2074 km reinforced concrete bridges - 3069 km 3068 km 3060 km 3023 km 3021 km 3019 km 2318 km 2323 km 2327 km 2457 km 2490 km 2333 km
at a distance of
Flood in Kyzylorda region is possible due to natural causes or under the influence of snow melting and discarded waste in reservoirs located in the upper reaches of the current
Ice dams hold streams, causing water to spill through the floodplain
Therefore, as necessary and contrary to the current rules, the issue of flooding of certain settlements of South Kazakhstan and Kyzylorda regions has not yet been resolved
During the navigation along the channel of the Syr Darya River from December to February, it performs sedimentary phenomena
Bugels are laid in the place of natural narrowing of the river bed or in an urgent turn of the channel
At the same time, depending on man-made conditions, the slots have their own locations: mobile crossings with low throughput of bridge crossings to the passage of floating ice and readiness of hydraulic structures for flood (hydraulic transport channels, water-regulating buildings, t)
) and the narrowing of the channel used for business activities
Another problem that worries specialists and environmentalists exploring the Syr Darya River is that the Syr Darya ulus with dense soil begins to sink the river bed
This leads to great difficulties, especially in the coming spring months, when a lot of water goes from the upper to lower bed.
Due to the depletion of Syr Darya culture, the waterproofness of the channel decreases, due to which floods occur annually
To increase the water permeability of the Syr Darya, it is necessary to clear the river bed from backfilled soil in winter through a glacial stream
In summer
flow rate slows down due to the small amount of water passing through the latitude
It is not possible to wash sand on weak cheese and take it forward
And in winter, the flow of stressed water increases between the Syrdarya nation and densely populated ice and the waterproofness of the channel increases
For a timely assessment of the flood situation in the regions, specialists of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergencies of the Republic of Kazakhstan "Kazselezoprivita" will conduct air-flow flights of the territory
On the sections from the Shardarinsky reservoir to the lower mouth of the Syr Darya, 15 temporary and mobile hydraulic structures of the Kazseleopriya State University were organized, the technical condition of especially important protective structures was checked, explosive works were carried out and recommendations for cleaning the Syr Darya river bed from ice were implemented
However, these measures did not completely eliminate the floods
Currently, mobile hydraulic structures are carried out in the Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions:
"Aitek bi" "Zhosaly" "Terenozek" "Aitek" "Karanzek" "Koktobe" "Zhulek" "Shardara Arys Koksaray Maykum Akyn-Zhakyp
According to the survey, 70% of the water area of ​ ​ the Shardarin reservoir is the thickness of ice under ice 10-20 cm
In all icing cases, the water level becomes floating
The water level adjoins the littered dam, which is not a water intake (height up to 1 meter)
When passing watered roads, the water passed directly along the defenseless low edge of the roads and violated it
In order to prevent the destruction of roads, the Shardarinsky reservoir operates in transit mode and moves consumption water up to 1500 m3/s, which is unfavorable for regulating the flow regime in the Syr Darya from flood in winter
To ensure the safety of floods in South Kazakhstan and Kyzylorda regions, it is necessary to regulate the annual predicted high-precision transit along the Arys River (tied to large snow) through the city of Kyzylorda, and until mid-February exclude flooding of the Koksaray Observation Center
Under modern conditions, the protection of flooding and flood zones according to the method of engineering protection is one of the most intensive methods at present:
Pumping of water from the flooded area
Tunnels and pipelines with partitions and culverts of enclosing channels may be used
Construction of beach facilities and controllers
Construction of the Koksaray reservoir, located on the border of South Kazakhstan and Kyzylorda regions, to regulate the water flows in winter with a design area of ​ ​ 30 km, regulating the water flow along the Syrzharia River in winter at the level of 300 m3/s
The construction of the reservoir reduces emergencies in case of emergency discharge of water from the Shardarin reservoir and floods
The project provides for the construction of 46 km of earth dams
The Coxaray Controller will transfer the water regime of the Syr Darya River to the previous irrigation regime
Over the past 35 years, 5260 km of dams were built to protect settlements from floods along the Syr Darya River, 5194 km of them in the Kyzylorda region, 66 km in the South Kazakhstan region
With the threat of a flood built in emergency conditions, beach and howitzer structures located on the banks of the Syr Darya River do not meet technical requirements, therefore, when the water level increases in a small amount in the river, dams are threatened with destruction or actual destruction
Protection of dams consists in the fact that the combined technologies of design production works (fixation of water-laying slopes of the dam and sealing of formations by mechanisms, etc.
) Not drawn up according to the Master Drawing
In most cases, the buildings are not in balance with the operating organizations, during the construction there was no abstract review of the production work
It is necessary to establish the composition of the competent commissions that monitor the work on checking the technical condition of defense facilities for the parity of the operational service and timely repair and installation work
The design of protective structures should be developed on an economic basis and on the basis of choosing a design solution taking into account the conditions of special areas

Units: atmospheric air emissions of pollutants, harmful contaminants household waste waste-waste hydrocarbons hydrogen sulfide with nitric oxide hydrogen sulfide anhydride ammonia sulfide chloride fluoride compounds aldehydes metallurgical aluminium oxide metallic galium sulphate aluminum methyltredbutyl ether propylene
Air pollution is one of the most pressing problems in the Republic of Kazakhstan
Emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere from stationary sources amount to about 25 million.
1 million tons of transport emissions.
There are three main ways to pollute the atmosphere: industrial household centers, cars
The proportion of these sources in air pollution depends on location
Currently, a large amount of industrial pollution has been identified by the general definition
Sources of pollution - thermal power plants that release flue sulfur and carbon dioxide into the air; metallurgical enterprises, especially non-ferrous metallurgy, which produces ammonia phosphoric compounds of mercury and arsenic compounds and parts into the atmosphere with acid-nitrogen chlorine of hydrogen sulfide; chemical and cement plants
Combustion of fuel into the air by harmful gases for the needs of enterprises occurs as a result of combustion and processing of domestic and industrial waste by heating of residential buildings [1 15-28 b
Pavlodar region, one of the particularly environmentally disadvantaged regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Pavlodar - industrially developed multi-industry industrial center
It is a city with its own multisectoral complex focused on the light and food industries, engineering oil refining products into clay soil for the production of electricity and heat
The main industry in the region, accounting for 70% of production, is the metallurgical industry and metalworking [2VisitKazakhstan
About six billion tons of industrial waste accumulated in Pavlodar region during the years of industrialization
Pavlodar region ranks third in the republic in terms of pollution by them
Over 100 million tons of waste generated annually
If we add household waste to this, today in the region 45 million tons and annually they include about 640 thousand tons of garbage
This is only visible waste
And how much poisonous waste lies underground
For example, 900 tons of mercury collected over the years from an electrolysis workshop
A clay wall was built that prevents mercury from flowing into the Irtysh River
But how profitable this is is unknown
If we talk about air pollution by industrial enterprises, 600,000 tons of harmful waste for health are received annually in Pavlodar region
This is part 4/1 of the Republic's emissions
Over the past 10 years, the volume of harmful waste in the region has grown by 46%
The main causes of excessive air pollution in the city are inefficient means of cleaning outdated industrial technologies, the use of low-quality fuel, renewable heat sources
weak use of alternative sources
A sharp increase in the number of vehicles leads to an increase in concentrations of hydrocarbon oxide and nitrogen dioxide in the city of Pavlodar [3 22-26]
Pavlodar region hosts the following enterprises: Pavlodar Aluminum Plant Kazakhstan Electrolysis Plant Pavlodar Machine-Building Plant Pavlodar Oil Refinery Pavlodar Chemical Plant (Kaustik) Casting and TB JSC
On the territory of the city, ZhES-1 ZhES-2 ZhES-3 operates
Figure 1 - Pavlodar Aluminum Plant
The products of these plants, on the one hand, are suitable for the needs of the population, on the other hand, pollutes the air
For example, Pavlodar Aluminum Plant - if heat energy suitable for the population will produce substances such as refractory clay lime, then Casting JSC will make products from molten steel
At the same time, the smoke of an aluminum plant with compounds of atmospheric fluorine and t
pollutes
Casting JSC - production of cast iron with liquid chlorine - production of paper with toxic carbon oxide (P) - production of artificial fibers with hydrogen sulfide with sulfur oxide contaminates the air with hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen sulfide [1 4 15-18 b
The source of pollution in the coal industry is terricons
Carbon monoxide resin compounds are released as a result of sulfurous gas
Substances released to the atmosphere from oil producers contain hydrogen sulfide hydrocarbons and poorly smelling gases (styrene divinyl toluene acetone isoprene)
The production of cement and building materials in the construction materials industry also produces environmentally harmful flats of fluorine nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide
Such harmful substances are released during the main technological processes - temperature treatment of semi-finished products of raw materials
Non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises release gases mixed with tea containing sulphur fluoride gas and metals [5 10 b]
The chemical industry produces plastic lubricants for household chemicals
It contaminates the atmosphere with sleds and various gases with organic and organic substances
Harmful substances emitted from industry are one of the dangers to the human body
Nitric oxide IV valence carbon monoxide IV valence from the chemical industry to the environment ammonia-hydrogen sulfide fluoride compounds and t
shares
Sulphur gases in the atmosphere are not stored for a long time, wet and stored for up to several hours if ammonia is present in the atmosphere
Catalytic photochemical when reacting with moisture in the atmosphere
Oxidizes H2 SO4 solution by reactions
This increases the risk of this connection
Sulphuric compounds pass through the mass of air to sulphate forms
Their transition takes place at an altitude of 750-1500 m at a wind speed of 10 m/s, the spread of sulfur gases will reach a distance of 300-400 km
All sectors of the energy industry - transport utility and agricultural
The main driving force for improving the well-being of the population, increasing productivity
Fuel and energy complex - an intersectoral system consisting of the exploration and transportation and operation of fuel
Closely connected with the fuel industry (oil and gas coal) and other sectors of the national economy
In addition, thermal power plants release gases containing nitrogen and sulfur oxides, ash metals to the atmosphere [6 72-78 b
Sulfur compounds make breathing difficult by affecting the airways of people and animals
As a result of the effect on the destruction of chlorophylls in plants, a weak process of photosynthesis occurs, the growth of the quality of woody plants is slowed down and crop yields are reduced
The increased sulphur content in the atmospheric air reduces the quality of industrial products of monuments to buildings with an increase in the cost of metals (corrosion)
In industrial areas, iron evaporates 20 times faster than in rural areas.
One of the dangers to human health is that dust is the most dangerous because it contains poisonous substances
Another major source of air pollution in Pavlodar city is a car
The content of waste emitted from them consists of more than two hundred types of gases, including at least complex mixtures of carcinogens
In recent years, the number of cars has been constantly growing, which negatively affects the environment, including human health
On average, one car 165 thousand per year
when running 2 tons of fuel, of which 45 tons of oxygen (50 times more than the human need)
At the same time, vehicles to the atmosphere (kg/year): 700 - choking gas
230 - unburned hydrocarbons 40 - nitrogen dioxide and 2-5 - solids
In addition, mainly due to the use of ethyl fuel, a large number of lead compounds are produced
Wastes entering the atmosphere also differ in vehicle types (Table 1)
Table 1 -% of various transport waste released into the air
The level of air pollution with impurities of harmful substances depends not only on emissions of harmful substances, but also on the conditions for the spread of harmful impurities in the air
Under certain meteorological conditions, the concentration of mixtures in the air can increase and reach a dangerous state
Located next to a large research road (10 m)
up to 50 m from the road) residents
proved that malignancies are 3-4 times more common than remote residents [7 31-40 bb
The residues of vehicles also contain nitric oxide
Nitrogen dioxide plays a big role in converting products into atmospheric air into hydrocarbons
Exhaust gases contain non-common hydrocarbon fuel
Of these, hexene and pentene are not the most recent hydrocarbons of particular relevance.
Due to incomplete combustion of fuel and lubricants in motor vehicles, part of the hydrocarbons turns into black lights containing resinous substances, mainly into a large amount of serum and technical violations of the resin motor and reducing the air-fuel ratio in order to accelerate the operation of the driver engine
becomes more and more when trying to get a "rich pile"
In such conditions, visible black smoke with police hydrocarbons and benzapyrene in the composition leaves behind the vehicle
Gaseous dust heavy metals hydrocarbons and benzapyrene phenols released from motor vehicles of production plants in the alloy, gaseous gaseous metals, gaseous gaseous and benzapyrene fluoride compounds with ammonia hydrogen sulfide, household waste, etc.
The main measures of protection of the atmosphere are control over the maximum dimensions of harmful substances
Currently, the question of the atmospheric air of the city of Pavlodar remains open
In this regard, various activities with environmental specialists are being carried out in the region
Preparation of environmental specialists for conservation in such a state of nature, for which activities carried out at the interstate level are not violated
environmental education, as well as the provision of services for the efficient use of natural resources to clean water from harmful substances by private enterprises
Most often, this measure is implemented by engineering methods
Enterprises have two main methods of nature conservation
One of them is the cleaning of harmful emissions
This method is not very effective in "purity," since it is impossible to completely stop pests from entering the biosphere, and cleaning one component can lead to further pollution of another
For example, the creation of wet filters will reduce air pollution, which will lead to even more water pollution
The second is to eliminate the causes of pollution, while developing technology with little or no waste
But at present, many enterprises have not implemented such technologies
Therefore, at present both methods should be applied primitively

Relevance of the Expected Accomplishments Research Programme, Goal of the Self-Education Evaluation Programme, how to teach dialogue learning
Head of State N.
Nazarbayev at the III Congress of Education and Science Workers: "The new generation of teachers should be much higher than the level of education
To do this, you need a teacher of a new formation "
Spiritually and creatively developed pedagogical abilities, distinguished by professional qualifications, high organizational abilities and innovative forces constantly create conditions for the development of the student as a person - the message says [1].
The content of this program occupies a special place in the formation of future specialists at a high professional level
In the implementation of this practice, the following topics were presented in the curriculum of the subject "Methodology for teaching chemistry," conducted by students of the full-time department of the 3rd year of the specialty "Chemistry":
VA - general characteristic of group elements
On these topics, students were chosen to work independently under the guidance of a teacher (SOPS) with the preparation of a consistent plan of these classes
The main content of the refresher programme is presented in seven modules, which are presented mixed during the training
In the educational process, I decided to start looking for a solution to the impact of the program on students
In order to solve this problem, the American philosopher John Dew, analyzing the scientific and methodological literature, realized that cognitive experience is a special place for creating an environment, that is, "Experience arises in the process of interaction between the individual and the environment" [2]
To confirm this, during the lecture lesson "Methods of teaching chemistry" with students of 3 courses of the specialty "Chemistry," I stopped at the stage of organizing group work before starting classes, I chose various ways of dividing students into groups
The first lecture highlighted topics for each group
One group divided the selected topic among themselves, primarily independently, after which each student discussed the lecture material he had studied in the group and explained to each other
Observing the progress of students with the group, I noticed the following actions:
Listen to each other with respect, listen to oral written conversation; increased self-confidence; everyone
the student has revealed personal specifics, students got rid of the unrest and distrust of themselves that arose at the beginning of the lesson
After mutual discussion, students handed out posters to them
On this poster, it was noted that the most key ideas should be removed from the educational material discussed by a group of students
Collaboration through top work has shown its effectiveness in each lesson
About this scientist-psychologist J.
Piaget wrote: "Akili of a person will recognize themselves, that is, psychologically, only in communication with other things or other minds" [3]
In this evidence, students tried to explain the meaning of the subject presented by him using drawings of various forms
During this period, I noticed that students at the beginning of the lesson are what can I do? Not ashamed if I can't add my share? I have disappeared feelings of fear towards the members of the group
At this moment Kazakh
"Difficult cargo is light," "Many tons of Russian lakes."
Each group defended the work in a pair
Then the game of one of the students continued.
To evaluate this group work, students were allocated pre-prepared income criteria
Students appreciated their work and the work of other groups
At the end of the lesson, an element of critical feedback thinking (reflexion) technology was conducted to know the results of students' collaboration on the Donn OGL table.
Summing up the game, we deepen and specify our views when disagreeing with educational analysis and exchange of views with other people
Therefore, I formulated that the use of paired group work in classes also needs to introduce discussion and thinking, proving in my work in Mercer (2005) that relationships in the tsurbator group play an important role in study
It is proved that paired group work will be effective if students teach others to discuss the information received and encourage them to understand or refute opinions
In this regard, in order to achieve high percentage retention rates for the educational pyramid provided by the National Befel Training Laboratory, it was determined that it was useful to train others.
The results of theoretical and methodological studies show the importance of conducting classes using the dialog method, including Mercer and Littleton (2007) In its writings, the dialogue emphasizes that, in addition to increasing the interest of students in classes, it contributes to the growth of their level of knowledge, as well as in the studies of these authors, it is stated that interactive communication with adults and work carried out together with friends affects their learning and cognitive development [4]
As indicated in Mercer's study, different forms of the lesson have been chosen with the ability to observe elements of debate commulatory research conversations
Since the students had just started this lecture, I started thinking about the method before starting a new lesson, that is, with their reflexion they connected those periods when they liked to face problems during the lesson.
And in order to define the topic of the new lesson, students who presented slides through ICT discussed these slides in pairs and identified the topic of today's lesson through the materials provided.
After defining the topic, students pre-prepared and posted to the basket selected color flags and were combined into 4 groups of 6 people by the selected colors:
Group Chemistry Training Analysis
Discuss the evolution of group learning methods
3, Discussion of classification of teaching methods
Group discussion on the plan of the ratio of the concepts "Methods of training" and "Methods of training" to group 4
As I observe students' actions to implement this topic, I noticed the priority of the Mercer Research Conversation Form
That is, students moved from teaching a monologue to dialogue learning, following the rules of working in a group, that is, listening to every opinion and proving their opinion, general opinion with the students of the group
exchanger
Analyzing the topic in the group, one or more students from the group talked about the key stages of task analysis, where the game of one of them continued as a second student
After listening to the work that each group did, separate written questions were asked to further reveal the topic to the students of the group
Students rated the work of one group as "Two stars of one desire" (that is, clockwise to the work of the next group recorded their stars and wishes for stickers)
In a research conversation in the Barnes and Mercer study, students work with their tsurbs in small groups that will have an orthac problem, they will exchange ideas and views on this issue.
The dialogue training carried out in the next lesson was the development of critical thinking through the dialogue when checking homework, in order to repeat the initial lesson, "Feedback," reflexively thinks
To create student feedback here
"I know" "I don't know what" through the critical element of thinking "What I want to know" established a written dialogue with students
At the end of the lesson, I explained these feedback questions
To make the next stage of the lesson, I moved to the next stage of the lesson [5], based on the fact that the speech in the transition of the scientist Alexander (2004) is not one of the processes of creating Tsarma-Tsinoria, but the process in which ideas move in a two-tier direction, on the basis of which the learning process takes place.
The reason for my choice of the "Dialogue Body" in passing this topic is that such a lesson is of great importance to the student, as well as that it is a collection of student actions used to teach students.
With regard to the importance of questions asked to promote dialogue in training:
encourages students to speak constructively on the topic;
defines the true interest and feelings of students;
develops students' desire for education and stimulates research;
helps students to build knowledge and exchange views;
promotes the thinking of students from criticism;
strengthens student relations with each other;
crossing and thinking students with each other helps to accumulate their thoughts
The elements of teaching the above dialogue are reflected in the joint implementation of the following classes with students
Task: Sequentially Zoy
Preparation of certificates of scientists to the place of chemistry training from the issued sections (analysis by 4 groups)
Task: Thinking
Grouping of classification criteria for training methods
according to Babansky;
Grouping classifications of educational techniques according to Skatkin;
Analysis of classification of teaching methods according to Nugimanov
The student explained all these plans using ICT
That is, an analysis of lesson plans showed how to use ICT teaching methods to exchange views with other students
In this regard, it is important for me to imagine that students during the dialogue will have an equal number of partners in joint learning or "exchange of views," as Mercer (2000) describes, who will make efforts to achieve an agreed outcome [5]
The importance of these aspects I also noticed when compiling seminars for penis students "Chemical School"
The group was given the task of opening the task on this poster from two sides, not knowing the first this subject from the post of students
a person should understand that from their scheme he is studying the subject "Chemistry at school," secondly, it is possible to improve the content of this subject
In revealing the content of a consistent lesson, scientist Alexander (2008) believes that learning in the form of dialogue will allow you to use the power of conversation to stimulate and develop students
Alexander believes that through dialogue, teachers will be able to determine the possibilities of "healthy" prospects in everyday thoughts and help regions work with developing ideas and overcome misunderstanding
In my practice, it was useful that these capabilities allow them to practice new ways of using language as an effective tsuru [6]
For the above ideas to be realized, students personally listened to the opinion about what they think about each other in the analysis of tasks for the resources provided to them, and all of them together in various ways, that is, by discussing reciprocity issues, made their conclusions on paper
At this point, I watched them think within the framework of this topic, visiting groups to monitor the direction of each group.
That is, within the framework of one topic that I noticed here, different points of view of their thinking in revealing this topic can be seen in the following evidence
There are two different points of view on two groups of these evidence, since initially I noticed that the associations of these students about this discipline are completely different, and after I asked an open question and entered into a dialogue with them, I noticed that if we are trying to understand the contradictions that arose with the sources of information in the content of this subject, then
And in the work of the second group, on the contrary, the impossibility of this issue was explained by the fact that nitrogen on the market is not part of substances and many natural organic compounds for free
This was a useful thought for me that Alexander (2008) can explore the field of his personal understanding when students are given the opportunity to participate in dialogues that were conducted and expanded in various ways in the classroom [7].
In modern literature, critical thinking includes "thinking about thinking," discussing important issues, and thinking about experience
At the same time, each creative teacher tells his students:
To be able to form your own opinion;
With the ability to come to a certain conclusion;
With the ability to logically compile evidence;
With you need to teach to be able to clearly and confidently express your game
Therefore, for the development of critical thinking, it is necessary to use double group work in classes to develop dialogue, as well as introduce discussion and thinking that "if children are actively involved in dialogue and discussion, there is an increase in the number of studies proving that their training will be more effective and intellectual achievements" [7 46 b
[]
For me, it is necessary to develop critical thinking skills and research that allow students to effectively and successfully participate in wider communication processes in which access to the sun is growing, "said scientist Alexander (Wolfe and Alexander).
] thought was very valuable
Teachers shall be evaluated in writing or orally
Any form they apply is followed not only by objective or insufficiently objective norms and standards, but also by perceptions of the child's learning and motivation, as well as cycles regarding concepts such as self-esteem and strength [7 52 b]
] I realized that you need to think about a valuable opinion
For the purpose of work in this direction, preliminary income criteria are defined for topics that have passed the practice
On the first topic, the following income criteria are defined in the cyclic plan "Methods of teaching chemistry"
Can provide reference on methods of teaching chemistry
Analyze ideas about chemistry training methods
Can open up the evolution of learning methods
Can characterize the classification of learning methods
Students came up with posters on these topics to evaluate this group work, students were given pre-prepared income criteria
Students appreciated their work and the work of other groups
Compliance with regulations (time)
Table 2 - evaluation group No. 1: 5- 70; 7-9-80; 10-90; 12- 95
During this task, I noticed that in working with the group, students discussed a high level of activity with each other.
The task performed as a test as a third feedback included ten questions during which the evaluation criterion was proposed
Figure -1
Evaluation using steepness and descriptors should be clear and known to conductors in advance
If criteria and descriptors are clearly specified for each task, the student can determine his level of knowledge, which will allow him to evaluate himself
In traditional classes, we took on everyone, not arranging students for the assessment process
I think that the assessment through the criterion awakened the student irritant
In accordance with the pencil colors (red-yellow-green dark brown), I wanted to divide the group into low-caliber and average students did not fall into the same group, as in previous classes, and the students themselves elected the group leader
The task of the team leader is to monitor which of the group members took an active part in the classes and which task he performed, and evaluate based on the correctness of work when checking the task
On this day, I began to check my homework, noticing that some students were not coping with homework, providing additional time in lessons to students who did not perform homework, members of the group helped their partners, in this I noticed the warm feelings of students for their victims and saw the environment of cooperation
In the next part of the lesson, linking past classes and a new topic, I did the following type of work:
All groups are given the same tasks, the task is completed in the amount of working time shown on the interactive board
The classes show the evaluation types and evaluation criteria for the assigned task (Table 4)
Table 4 - Evaluation criterion for tasks defined in the lesson
43 - 38 points "5"; 37 - 30 points "4"; 29 - 15 points "3"
During the evaluation period, team leaders were told that some (14 groups) of the teams had some discrepancies compared to the benchmark for which they submitted monitoring results, but after proving the evaluations made by team leaders, they agreed with the team leader's view
The lesson feedback is jointly filled with the ECB's Q&A schedule, so I decided that students want to learn about the new topic about the relationship between the past class and the new topic by identifying the level of student knowledge, identifying through this table what students need to be covered in the upcoming class
Each group was given separate assignments on topics, during the execution of which it was allowed to use the Internet network on computer mobile phones, since the tasks set included the manufacture of posters using additional materials, as well as the organization of a question-answer between groups
In this regard, ICT "is a tool to assist teachers in teaching, providing guidance to guides and facilitating understanding of their perceptions.
Therefore, we are guided by an idea that requires the thoughtful application of these technologies in the learning process "[7 110 b
ICT was widely used in the lessons
This allowed students to simplify their work and remember the material to use their capabilities when performing these tasks over the Internet.
The entry of students into dialogue as part of the defense of the presentation of each group created a positive relationship between them, as well as contributed to the formation of a student's culture of interviewing each other through research conversations
At the end of the presentation, members of the group organized feedback in the form of questions and answers, where the creative abilities of students were manifested.
Therefore, I think that in order to identify students of a low average high level who sit in the audience, it is advisable to perform level tasks, because each student understands that when performing tasks for color stickers, you still need to improve knowledge.
During the lesson, you should teach to distinguish between level tasks on the Blum taxonomy
For example, level 1 tasks: tasks aimed at applying cognitive understanding
The disclosure of content in the main text of these tasks includes tasks that have not been changed in the form of mastering basic concepts
In most cases these are orders When? Who? Where? - based on answering questions
Level 2 tasks: tasks aimed at understanding support for analysis
These tasks are aimed at understanding the specifics of the main text to compare the causes of the event with the clarification of the causes
Why are these tasks often? Because you too? of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Level 3 tasks: tasks aimed at synthesis and evaluation
These tasks, in addition to the text, are tasks that encourage the student to think deeply and to think differently.
Most often these tasks: What do you think
What events do you think you can compare with, it consists of the tasks of proving your thought
For example, in the second phase of the training, we started reporting on the level of application of knowledge obtained using theoretical material.
Students of the Nitrogen Bismuth Phosphorus Antimony Arsenic group were to compile a report, divided into groups
Six reports were submitted per group with the same report structure and injury-to-difficulty oriented, criteria were evaluated depending on the number of collected student reports, according to which criteria were compiled depending on the number of each report issued 6.
With the daily use of the final level tasks in the lessons, students are inclined to a clear answer to the openness of their thoughts and opinions to the group, since each student or student feels confident, because everyone is responsible for the tasks of their level
I think that with this method, students sitting silently open up and get better every day.

The Wonders and Truthfulness of Chemistry
This article considers chemistry as science and its properties together with other sciences, as parts of invisible matter in the environment and celestial bodies, from microorganisms to invaluable distant and complex processes of life of people and animals
Chemical science has a great influence on all fields of natural and technical sciences
Uncover the wonders of nature and the miracles of multifaceted қү_piyalarsh and confront religious beliefs
For example, irradiation of seawater - a natural phenomenon will never cease to admire humanity
People of religious faith explained this phenomenon by the influence of super-sensitive forces
This phenomenon can be observed at night near the cemetery
Chemical science has proved these phenomena - luminescence of inorganic and organic substances, that is, the fact that gas is associated with the formor compounds of some liquid and solid bodies based on irradiation in a cold state without heating

Classification of teaching methods, teaching methods, teaching methods, Expected results of educational activities of students of educational activities of cognitive activity levels
The concept of "learning method" is quite complex and multi-valued
Features of the category "teaching methods" in the methodology of teaching chemistry - one of the pedagogical sciences
The answers of scientists to the question "How to learn?"
The use of the word "Method" in the previous version is the etymology of its connection with the concept of "methodology"
The main thoughts in the directories of four groups:
) "teacher in first place" (Yu.
) draws attention to the fact that the teacher is closely connected with the teaching (reading) of the student; Groups 3 (N
) "in organizational activity, both parties are authorized and have the same meaning"; Group 4 (T)
) pupil study is the main task of the teacher
involving him in the process of assisting him in the organization of his training activities [1]
With regard to the evolution of teaching methods, we will focus on changing the goals of teaching for the development of mankind and improving the general culture of society.
The impact of the level of development of productive forces and the nature of industrial relations on the goals of training
Stages of learning methods evolution: imitation - verbal interpretation - dogmatic learning - visual learning - increasing student motivation for learning - problem learning - developing learning
Use of educational achievements in teaching methods
Opportunities achieved through visual learning
The direction of increasing the effectiveness of training to increase the motivation of students to learn
Humanization of education, humane methods
Expected result from application of problematic training methods
Humanitarian psychological basis of developmental learning methods
Methods that are combined into the concept of "Methods of developmental learning"
The availability in the educational literature (textbooks and UMC) of the possibility of using teaching methods aimed at the comprehensive development of the personality of high school students is not an empty conversation, but a requirement of life itself
With regard to the classification of teaching methods, various criteria for the classification of teaching methods, including chemistry
Danilov et al.
scientists' thoughts on classification of methods
Classification proposed by Babansky with a thorough review of all classifications of teaching methods
Criteria for classification of teaching methods according to the level of student activity (passive asset) depending on the level of participation in productive (creative) activities (explanatory and illustrated reproductive problem partial survey) on sources of knowledge (verbal visual practice) for didactic purposes (verification of DBD of new knowledge development, development of skills and practical use of knowledge) organizational classification (accumulation of experience of communication between persons of organization of educational and cognitive activity, control of results of educational and methodological activity of emotional and creative activity)
Classification of training methods by the clerk depending on the level of participation in productive (creative) activities: the method of research of the problematic method of training
Content of reproductive problem and research methods of training, activities of teacher and student in their application
Lordkipanidze's simple classification of teaching methods: verbal visual practices [2]
The concept of the method of teaching chemistry Professor I.
according to the classification of Nugimanov
The concept of "way of learning"
The diversity of approaches to this teaching category depends on the close relationship of teaching methods to teaching methods
Features of teaching methods in chemistry training methods
Learning Methods I
Nugimanova and N.
certificates issued by Methodist scientists
In the framework of "certain teaching methods," "show how they are used in practice (for example," Pure substances and impurities "of class 8 in various ways)
The ability to identify teaching methods and learning methods is of great importance to the future chemistry teacher
Hence the means of learning if they matter to their species
Means of training or training activities
"Students - Learning Tools - Learning Information"
Ways to include educational means in the educational process (chemistry training): 1) the teacher uses them "in purity"; 2) assembling them with students when solving a certain theoretical problem in a lesson
The three positions of methodologists in the development and application of learning tools: Position 1 - learning tools are visuals and controls that are convenient, but can be read without them; Position 2 - Learning Tools - The Only Way to Achieve a Learning Goal
The remaining components shall be based on their specific characteristics corresponding to the means of training; Item 3 - Teaching Facilities Shall Be Provided in Teacher-Student Relationship System
Experience and experimental research of educators such as Kaloshina will be considered
Types of educational means: material and conscious (verbal-materialized)
Conditions for the use of training tools in the training methodology
The education and education of chemistry are decided first of all in lessons, then improved and deepened in other forms of education
Lesson - a form of chemistry training
The whole set of components of the content and methods of teaching and education of the educational system is carried out during the lessons [3]
The main form of training is the essence of the lesson
Definitions for Lesson
Help Skatkin (1969
Lesson services: development of educational education, self-education
Methodological conditions necessary for optimal performance of activities of classes: clear definition of goals of education and development of knowledge of each lesson; Optimal definition of the lesson content and the scope of the training material Selection of the most effective methods and methods of learning that provide educational interest to students; competent organization of the lesson (timely start of logical coordination of the work, complete the classes and maintain a certain pace of the classes); Optimal use of visual aids
Key Structural Parts (Components) of Lesson
Comparative characteristics of traditional classes and technologically organized lessons (block-technological classes)
Advantage of a technologically organized class
Ways of its holding
Lesson Planning
Mandatory components of the traditional lesson plan: the date of the lesson sequence number of the lesson according to the thematic plan; Lesson theme educational and educational purposes of the classes; structure of classes, determination of time for which main parts and stages of classes are allocated; the content of the lesson (a number of semantic parts of the educational material -
division into "steps"); methods and methods of work of the student and teacher for each part of the classes; equipment for each stage of the training; homework
Planning of technologically organized classes
Content of Job Instructions: expected result; The importance of mastered education for the student; occupation algorithm; organizational form of the learning method, method of student activity organization (logical cognitive training and intellectual knowledge accounting), basic concepts in information sources, task for lesson evaluation [4]
Types of occupations
The methodology of teaching pedagogy and chemistry contains various criteria and opinions on the difference in the types of classes
Types of classes that vary according to didactic goals: mixed classes, classes on the assimilation of new material
Classics of chemistry training N
According to Shapovalenko, the types of classes vary depending on the nature of the material undergoing the following chemistry:
mastering new knowledge and skills;
improvement and application of theoretical knowledge and power;
synthesis and systematization of knowledge;
monitoring - accounting;
mixed content classes
Possibilities of planning classes in these classifications from chemistry according to modern curricula
Types of classes allocated depending on their content in the study of chemistry (most often used classification): laboratory lesson, Saraman lesson, lecture seminar
The state of conducting classes in pure form or in a mixed (coordinated) state in the conditions of technological organization (intensification of integration) of classes at present
For various actions as part of the teacher's mixed lesson (laboratory tasks, qualification work

Relationship of the calendar plan to the thematic plan
Thematic Plan for Traditional Classes < - Lesson Flow Charts
Content of the thematic plan for the traditional lesson, The purpose of the lesson is a home task in the educational structure of literature, in which the necessary method of classes is used
In the first section of the chemistry course of the 8th grade - the thematic plan "Pure substances and additives" will be presented
Studying the properties of a substance leads to the concepts of pure substance and mixture
Concept of the word "concept"
Classification of concepts in the chemical discipline Shapovalenko: special concepts of scientific simple-complex-general chemistry
Basic chemical concepts constituting the structure of chemical discipline
Types of chemical concept
Gradual complication of concepts
Transformation of simple concepts into complex concepts of special chemical concepts of their peculiarities
General chemical concepts of their formation
Commissars, etc.
classification of concepts by methodists by significance
Chemical concepts of level I: "simple substance" "complex substance"
"mixture" "pure substance"
Level II chemical concepts: atomic element index
Comparative atomic weights of chemical elements of calculation by chemical formula of relative molecular weight of substance
The meaning of the relationship between concepts at each level reflects its integrity
It is necessary to take into account the ways in which students form chemical concepts depending on age
The meaning of consistency in the transmission of chemical concepts depending on the age of students
The concept of complex chemical concepts ("Concepts at the level of atomic-molecular science" "Theory of atomic structures and concepts considered from the point of view of periodic law and the system" "Ideas about the theory of electrolytic dissociation" ") considers the meaning of the transfer of chemistry in the last courses, and the" substance "" molecule "" - training in the initial courses of the subject such concepts as "property of matter"
Next, ways to evaluate knowledge in chemistry training will be described.
Here is the importance of checking the results of studying chemistry by students or their knowledge and the curriculum to be mastered by educational material
Various types of testing of knowledge obtained by students in chemistry
Types of current thematic (periodic or intermediate) and final testing of students' knowledge:
Types of graphical practical and test checks: individual and frontal oral, depending on the method of verification
Checkcards via Terminology and Graphic Dictation Table, Level Jobs, Group Working Discussions
Method of unified national testing and testing [6]
The combined advantages and disadvantages of teaching methods and techniques greatly assist teaching as guidance
Teacher's standards of professional ethics differ with regard to the objectivity and subjectivity and assessment of students' knowledge

Health and recreation tourism medical clay mineral water recreational sanatorium
Health tourism is one of the promising areas of development of recreational potential of tourist areas
Famous German scientist W
Health tourism according to the definition of Nahrstedt includes visits to local and foreign tourists balneological and other resorts in case of change of permanent settlement and provision of health programs to them [1]
Dr. Aris Ikkos believes that health tourism is mainly associated with thermal tourism and visits to mineral sources for medicinal purposes [2]
This type of tourism has a natural resource focus
Mineral water reserves used for balneological purposes in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan amount to 29,800 m3 per day, which is 05% of all underground mineral water [3]
At the beginning of 1970
Sydykov identified 6 balneo- logical groups of underground mineral waters in the territory of Kazakhstan and gave a description of each group [4]
Kazakhstan also has an unlimited supply of mineral clays with medicinal properties
20 hydromineral districts were allocated for comparative assessment of recreational attractiveness and possibilities of development of health-improving tourism based on analysis of natural recreational resources
A scoring system was used for integrated assessment of areas, taking into account the determinants and relationships of individual natural elements (table 1)
Table 1 - Assessment of recreational potential of hydromineral regions of Kazakhstan
Zoning by points was carried out in accordance with the indicators given in Table 2
Table 2 - Indicators of the point assessment of recreational resources
Note: Compiled by the author
According to the total average score, all hydromineral areas are divided into 4 groups in accordance with recreational attractiveness, the boundaries of which are determined depending on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of recreational resources
As a result of the analyses, hydromineral areas of different levels of recreational potential were identified (Figure 1)
Figure 1 - Map-diagram of natural recreational resources of Kazakhstan Note compiled by the author on the basis of sources: [3] [5]
Hydromineral areas with high natural recreational potential are characterized by wide natural resources and favorable climatic conditions
They include the following areas: Shortands-Yereimentau Or Northern Tian Shan and Keles-Shardara
The group of hydromineral areas with high natural recreational potential includes Mangistausko-Ustirt Yesil Altai and Balkhash-Alakol
Inder-Embi Tobol Karkaraly- Bayanaul Irtysh-Kulyndy Talas-Ogem and Syrdarya-Aral are assigned to hydromineral areas with medium natural recreational potential
The group of hydromineral areas with low natural recreational potential includes Zhaiyk-Aralsor Ilek-Shalkar Ulytau-Atasu Sauyr- Tarbagatay Zhetysu Alatau and Shu-Sarysu
Ile Balkhash-Alakolsky Yesilsky and Mangistau-Ustirt districts, developed at the middle level, can be noted as the most promising hydromineral areas
Their total reserve, which has the greatest potential of mineral water sources in the Ili hydromineral region, is 8130 m3/day
Most of the territory of this hydromineral region is part of the Karadal cluster in accordance with the master plan of tourism development of Almaty region
Within the framework of the master plan, it is planned to establish new medical and recreational places for the study and evaluation of balneological resources and training of personnel from among the local population to improve the quality of infrastructure in existing institutions [6]
On the territory of the Balkhash-Alakol hydromineral region there are 4 sources of mineral water and 10 deposits of medicinal clays, as well as most of its territory are occupied by the shores of Lake Balkhash and Alakol
Some regions of the Balkhash-Alakol hydromineral region are part of the Alakol-Zhetysu and East Balkhash, as well as the Kapshagai clusters
A health facility on the Alakol coast is currently under construction within the cluster [6]
Along with medical and recreational tourism in this area there is an opportunity to develop beach educational and sports tourism
On the territory of the Yesilsky hydromineral region there are 6 sources of mineral water and 7 deposits of therapeutic clays
Currently, the mineral resources of the Yesilsky hydromineral region
Serebryany Bor and Transsib sanatoriums operate on the base
On the basis of healing clay lakes in this region we offer to build several mud treatment centers
On the territory of the Mangysto-Ustirsky hydromineral region there are 4 sources of mineral water and 1 deposit of therapeutic clays, as well as on the tenth territory there are sources of thermal water
On the basis of mineral resources, the Chagala sanatorium and the Kenderley resort operate
However, we offer to open health centers specializing in balneo therapy and thalassotherapy based on mineral springs with a low degree of development of this area.
Summing up the above information, in Kazakhstan, the key issues that hinder the development of this industry include the shortage of investors and state support for the construction of sanatorium and resort institutions in promising areas and the improvement of existing institutions
For the development of health tourism, it is necessary to conduct large-scale research work in the regions with the involvement of investors and the development of infrastructure
Concept of development of tourism industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2020 noted expediency of development of health-improving tourism and in this regard many measures are implemented

History of the city Great Silk Road - international way of communication trade links Civilizational historical monuments strong cultural centers economic economy
The Great Silk Road has long been the largest international link with the Pacific coast and the Mediterranean countries, continuing Western European intervals
This is one of the unique historical monuments of human civilization
The passage of this ancient caravan road through the territory of the modern Republic of Kazakhstan indicates that the Kazakh people did not stay away from the civilization of the West and East, where the Great Silk Road was connected
The Great Silk Road became a trading hub for 1000 years BC
One of the historical remarks in human civilization was the bridge between the west and the east of Europe and Asia
Since the IV century, he had two routes to the intersection of Kazakhstan
Syrdarya and Tianshan routes are widely deployed
The first route began from China through East Turkestan through Kashkar to Zhetysu, then through the Syr-Dariysky island through Khorezm to Mangystau to the lower reaches of the Urals to the banks of the Volga and Don to the Caucasus along the Black Sea coast to the Middle East and Byzantium.
In this direction was the Syr Darya River, which continued west and east
Zhetysu and
The second path begins with East Turkestan
Through the valleys of Zhetysu Shu Ili along the Ili Kyrgyz Talas Alatau through Shashka (Tashkent) through the Samarkand of Bukhara Merv is connected with the Byzantium of Asia Minor
Cities along the way Suyab Balasagun Sairam Kulan Taraz Koylyk Sauran
These cities are caravans from Japan and Korea in the Middle Ages from China to Central Asia, then to Russia
The Great Silk Road, together with the unification of cultures of crowded peoples, held a historical position in determining the characteristics of its nature
In this matter there is merit of peoples inhabiting the lands of Kazakhstan
They inherited household (yurt) literature rich in the manufacture of stables and carpet products from silver
One of the evidence is the monuments "Man in Gold Clothes" found in the cities of Yesik and Araltobe - Vostochny
Finds from the Berelsky burial ground in Kazakhstan Orkhon monuments of ancient Turkish written literature
According to some reports, the name "The Great Silk Road" on the ancient caravan was subsequently given
This name is closely related to silk, the main product supplied in trade relations between countries, along with gold, which has risen to the level of the international currency
The name "The Great Silk Road" was received by the famous geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen, who wrote extensive works on the physical geography of China and the relief of Asia
Subsequently, this name was widely used at the international level [2]
Baba-Ata (Almaty) in the 10th century along the Ili latau of the Silk Road	Through Talhiz (Talgar) begins the revitalization of the part overlooking the Ili Valley
Many cities appeared on this part of the road
Their names have survived to this day along the paths of travelers passing the Silk Road
Actually, LX-X! In the Arab and Iranian ways and geographical literature, widely known in centuries, the peculiarities of the natural conditions of settlements located along the Silk Road are clearly described [3]

Global Competitiveness of Domestic Technologies Global Competitiveness Rating of the World Economic Forum
The concept of competition today becomes the object of research on economic and social geography
The emergence and development of the general concept of competition reflect the process of interaction that has developed in the ancient world from the Latin word "concurro/concurencia"
To date, there are several ways to determine the essence of competition theory
So what
In the handbook "Market Economy," competition means competition between private service providers for their own benefit.
Competition in the market economy serves as the main regulator
Its strength is spontaneous if it is not adjusted by other mechanisms, may be exacerbated by economic social environmental and other unnecessary consequences [1]
The modern term "competition" comes from the German word "competitor"
The key concept that reflects the importance of competitive market relations is the type of relationship between producers and consumers, the center of the market economy system, to the establishment of prices and goods in the market in the formation of the market rate and the volume of demand
The anticompetitive power of a person is characterized by ahead of others, and in the economic environment, competitiveness is characterized by a contribution to stability and attitude to the market industry
Competition is a dynamic process that serves to secure the market for goods
A key concept that reflects the importance of competitive market relations is the type of relationship between producers and consumers, the center of the market economy system, in determining market prices and volumes of goods in the formation of the market rate and volume of demand
Competition Theory A for the First Time
Considered in Smith's work "Research on the nature and causes of national wealth"
Then he saw competition as competition between members interested in achieving one goal and developed a competition mechanism that objectively equalizes industry revenue standards and rationally distributes resources among industries [2]

Currently, the improvement of national competitiveness is becoming an external benchmark in the state regulation of the main priorities of the country's foreign economic policy
Kazakhstan is among countries with high level of development in competitiveness index
The improvement of the competitiveness position of the country is mainly reflected in all competitiveness factors
Basing Kazakhstan's competitiveness in the process of industrial and innovative development on domestic technologies is considered as the only way of the country's global competitiveness
In this regard, the consideration of the main direction of research work from the point of view of modernizing the physical infrastructure that contributes to the accelerated industrial and innovative development of the country, and strengthening the institutional framework will become the basis for determining the competitiveness of Kazakhstan in the process of socio-economic development
The history of the development of problems of international competitiveness began from an early beginning - interest in it has intensified in recent years with the beginning of the struggle against the competitiveness of the world economy
Currently, renowned economists and major international institutions in more than 100 countries deal with international competitiveness issues
To reduce negative trends based on global competition processes among countries, many organizations of conventions commissions and other institutions have been established to streamline monetary tax relations between national economies
Under the auspices of the World Economic Forum (WEF), a scientific and jewelry project on competitiveness has been operating for more than 20 years
Under this project, national competitiveness is understood as "the ability to maintain the growth rate of real average per capita income calculated by the growth rate of gross domestic product per capita as a whole"
The World Economic Forum project will carry out intercountry comparative analysis and produce a compendium index through statistical processing
The totality of these indices is determined by the level of competitiveness of the countries in question and, accordingly, programmes are adopted to improve their competitiveness.
World Economic Forum - an authoritative study, which annually publishes the competitiveness rating of the world's states, covers institutional political and social aspects, as well as factors of productivity and innovation
Its main objective is to enhance the competitiveness of any State by improving the global conditions of peace and the well-being of citizens by assisting the world community in addressing issues of economic development and potential progress, so that the forum will contribute to the development of partnership between business political intellectual and other leaders in discussing and addressing topical issues of global development [8]
Global Competitiveness Rating - Global Studies on Economic Competitiveness Indicators of Countries
He is considered the method of the leading European Institute of Management, located in Lausanne, Switzerland
Global competitiveness, together with determining the competitiveness of States and regions, creates conditions for the formation of national economies
Each State is rated by analysing 333 criteria according to four main indicators of the country's economic life:
Economic situation
Effectiveness of the Government
Business Environment Status
Infrastructure Status
The specific gravity of these four indicators is
International organizations, including the National Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, participate in the calculation
WTO World Bank XV K et al.
Use data from institutions as well as 57 partner institutions worldwide
Global Competitiveness Report is the annual report of the World Economic Forum
The first report was published in 1979.
Since 2004, the Global Competitiveness Index has classified countries according to levels of development
The Competitiveness Index assesses the ability of countries to ensure a high standard of living for the population
It depends on how effectively the country uses natural resources
1987 US Presidential Commission
The definition of international competitiveness in the report "World Competition: a New Reality" is known in the scientific environment
In it, competitiveness means that each nation produces and services goods in free and real competition, responding to the needs of the international market, as well as maintaining the same level or increasing the real incomes of its citizens
This definition has not yet eliminated its relevance, since its basic basis is to improve the vital activities of the population in the theory of competitiveness [9]
The improvement of national competitiveness in the twenty-first century has become an external benchmark in the state regulation of the main priorities of the foreign economic policy of many countries
In essence, international competition is an instrument for gaining its place in the world economic system, which can only be achieved by improving the efficiency of the national economy.
With the onset of economic globalization, competition has indeed become global
The world economic system is understood as a set of national economies that create their global market
The competitiveness of countries depends on its national productivity base
National competitiveness - a set of factors that allow one country to have an advantage over another in all sectors of social activity; the ability of the state to remain in a permanent position without external shocks
An example of this is the US states Canada Western Europe, Japan Australian Union New Zealand South Africa Republic of Israel
Among the developed countries of the world, new industrial countries occupy a special place (Singapore Republic of Korea Argentina Brazil, etc.
Characteristic feature for them
exports manufactured goods with a developed sectoral structure of the economy with a higher level of gross domestic product per capita
In them, market relations are at a richer level than in developing countries
Republics of the former USSR and most of the countries of Eastern Europe among the developed countries
However, the discovery of a lag in the pace of scientific and technological progress and economic efficiency is associated with a drop in the standard of living of the population of these countries
Therefore, a number of reforms are being adopted in these countries with a view to achieving socio-economic recovery
One of such reforms is that Kazakhstan adheres to the direction of industrial and innovative development as a direction of competitiveness
Its main goal is to create a new innovative society that will realize its needs
Improvement of Kazakhstan's competitiveness position is mainly reflected in all competitiveness factors
Improving competitiveness indicators - health-care labour market, information and communication technologies and tax administration of state financial institutions, quality of secondary education is considered a competitive priority of the country
In modern conditions, competitiveness is taken into account not only by macroeconomic factors, but also by the quality of the labor force by its introduction of innovations into practice
According to experts of the Institute of Economic Research,
the most significant factor of ability is the increase in the share of private sectors in the IO and the creation of new jobs, the introduction of innovations, the improvement of the institutional system of the market competition policy, increased productivity, the expansion of the domestic and external markets for direct attraction of foreign and domestic investments
The global economic crisis certainly affects the competitiveness of the country
Due to the fact that the main exporter of Kazakhstan's economic products is raw materials, including oil, the country is slightly reducing its position in the global ranking
About this in September 2016-2017.
can be seen in the global competitiveness ranking [10]
At the end of 2016
Among 138 countries, Kazakhstan ranks 53rd and is in Rwanda with Costa Rica
For 5 factors out of 12 competitiveness factors this year (including progress in innovation), the country showed a good position, for 7 factors (including the smallest indicator of the microeconomic environment) the position was reduced
This first determines the need to implement measures aimed at increasing the resilience of the national economy to the negative consequences of the current global financial and economic crisis
Today, increasing the competitiveness of the national economy of Kazakhstan requires the implementation of a number of measures
In this regard, measures for the country's post-crisis development will be aimed at improving the business and investment climate, strengthening the country's financial system and improving the efficiency of public administration.
And the qualitative growth of the national economy should be based on the development of human resources and the strengthening of the institutional framework for the modernization of infrastructure that contributes to the forced industrial and innovative development of the country, only in this case the issues of internal stability and foreign policy will maintain the country's competitiveness

Vector of sustainable economic development of the Republic of Kazakhstan
For the Republic of Kazakhstan, the transition to sustainable development is the only necessity
Economic growth using natural resources can only occur at a certain stage
Today, economic growth is mainly due to the use of commodity prices in world markets and natural resources for a certain amount
Growth in gross domestic product occurs in increased emissions to the environment
In today's conditions, growth and development require a better and more innovative mechanism
The main threat to the stability of the national economy is a weak level of readiness to join the World Trade Organization (WTO)
The health and demographic status of the population is civil law at an insufficient level of economic and environmental literacy
With sustainable political development, Kazakhstan plays an important role in the development of the country as a source of balanced initiatives for the international community
The Republic of Kazakhstan plays a special role in ensuring the ecological stability of the Eurasian continent
As a political cultural and economic bridge between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan performs a similar connecting function for the development of landscape and ecological systems on the continent
Overcoming these obstacles should be the transitional main goal of the Republic of Kazakhstan for sustainable development
Words: sustainable development of ecology economy
Single-town production infrastructure demographic migration depressed city innovation
In the January Address to the People of Kazakhstan "Socio-economic modernization is the main course of development of Kazakhstan" President of the Republic of Kazakhstan N.
Nazarbayev instructed the Government to develop the Program for the development of single-industry towns for 2012-2020
After the Head of State instructed the Government to solve this problem, the industry began to take measures that should have had a significant priority
After that, a number of measures were taken in remote small towns and settlements of the country to ensure employment of the population
A feature of a single-industry town is that the economy of the city depends on one institution or one enterprise
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, factories in many single-industry towns were destroyed, and jobs were closed, the need for a single-industry town disappeared
This increased the number of unemployed and sharply reduced the social situation of the population
According to M UES, 27 single-industry towns with a population of 15 million people (16% of the country's population)
Specialization (in Kazakhstan): industrial enterprises - 21 cities of production - 6 cities: Serebryansk Stepnogorsk Aksu Zhezkazgan Satpayev Temirtau Research Center - Kurchatov
Single-industry towns cover an average of 10 thousand to 100 thousand people
Most of them work in one place [1]
Urban economy is seen as part of the regional economy
The prospects and pace of development of the regional economy depend, first of all, on the rational and unsustainable organization of the economy of individual cities
In the medium and small cities of Kazakhstan, 12 industries are developed, of which coal and gas industries are in the leading place.
Relatively low levels of light and food industry
To date, 15 million are in single-industry towns.
more people live
A decrease in the number of people in single-industry towns by 168%, respectively, means a decrease in the average number of small cities
In single-industry towns as a whole, a change in demographic trends is observed in the republic, but this issue is growing
High mortality rates and declining fertility significantly affected natural population growth
The closure of city-forming enterprises, respectively, the increase in the number of unemployed significantly changed the pyramid of age characteristics of the population in order to find work and migrate the able-bodied population
Signs of demographic decline
The number of people with age has increased significantly, the number of pregnant women has decreased
Economic reforms, instead of geographical ones to the resource potential of small cities. In the context of the deepening economic crisis, there is an increase in their classification in socio-economic development, depending on the levels of production infrastructure and other factors in each of them to economic indicators
In this regard, a special crisis was observed in lagging cities
From a special crisis and backward cities on their own, it is impossible to get out of a crisis situation and underdevelopment in development, so depressed especially depressed cities should become targets of targeted state support
Industry in small cities with a depressed economy is characterized by the specialization of clearly defined industries in 1-2 areas, and other industries do not develop significantly
Due to the lack of demand for low competitiveness of manufactured products by large industrial enterprises due to the lack of a market, there is a process of downtime associated with high tariffs for transport
Their impact has been drastically reduced by the wear and tear of devices in today's environment and a decrease in the number of skilled professionals as a result of migration
A significant decrease in the number of jobs to reduce innovation activity in small cities with depressed economies built near small deposits of mineral resources increased the range of issues related to the state of social and production infrastructure
The selection of the most necessary set of indicators in these cases forms the innovative potential of the region, characterizing the resource and performance
When solving the problem, we divided the indicators into bilateral, that is, general and individual:
the first is basic and requires transparency from the state of the region;
the second - plays an additional role and serves to advance the process of innovative development in the region
in the figure, depending on some circumstances, generalized indicators can be implemented:
The indicator system will ensure that innovation processes are integrated
"Science-Innovation-Manufacturing and Supply."
The set of indicators in the innovation sphere of the region should determine all changes that are very flexible (resources and effective)
Indicators are limited and classified by regional statistics, and their capabilities should be consistent with the assessment of the innovation process within the territorial framework
Figure 3
Regional Innovation Capacity Assessment Unit
Indicators characterizing the innovative potential of this region are collected in five evaluation blocks
Ranking the difficulties that arise in single-industry enterprises allows you to combine them in the following list:
Legacy devices and technologies
No Product Market
Difficulties in obtaining credit
Each city has separate issues related to objects and subjective factors, peculiarities of economic development for internal and external reasons, which, in turn, are aimed at developing a policy of their support [2]
Famous American sociologist E.
Taffler in his work "The Third Wave" said: "Information and knowledge become the main strategic resources
This, first of all, will lead to serious changes in the territorial deployment of production forces
If in the pre-industrial era cities appear at the junctions of trade routes, then in the industrial era - near sources of raw materials and energy, and in the post-industrial era - near research centers and large research centers "[3 257 b
One of the evidence is Silicon Valley in the United States
Therefore, in order to solve complex socio-economic problems in the regions of the country, it is already necessary to start production of products that are really innovative in small cities, especially in regions with a small priority for the development of old types of production, and the formation of human capital in regions that meet these requirements [3]
As you know, during the years of independence of the country, the condition of many rural small towns has worsened
One of them is the city of Arkalyk
This city begins in the 1950-1960s with the discovery of bauxite deposits here
Kyzylkozy is a red city
Initially, it is planned to build a working village for 20 thousand people
After the opening of the region, regional infrastructure will begin to develop
In addition, the campaign to develop the Great All-Union shock construction will begin
The Soviet government made efforts to form Arkalyk as the center of the region not only as a center of bauxite production, but also as the administrative center of all settlements in the region.
Several educational institutions opened new factories and reached the status of a large city
In the 1990s, the Independent Country, which again became an independent state, experienced a massive crisis
So, after years, times change
Then several factors led to a compact isolation of the city
Firstly, the plants began to close
Secondly, the area is closed
Third - heat and light are turned off
During this difficult period, many citizens moved into the process, and the fate of the city was in a difficult situation
One third of buildings are empty
Especially neglected microdistricts in the new site
Of the previous 70 thousand people, only 27 thousand remained
Arkalyk is the most important city not only of Kostanay region, but also of the republic
During the years of stagnation, the city experienced the greatest shocks
The Government is currently developing small towns
So, in the Kostanay region there are 4 cities included in the Rudny program - a city with high potential of Lisakov and Zhitikar, and the potential of Arkalyk is low
Therefore, the government pays special attention to the development of our city
Increased capacity of the city is ensured in all areas
Among them are new projects included in the Industrialization Map, and investment projects of the region, which are being implemented
One of two promising projects:
Modernization of poultry farm and production of eggs of Agrointerptitsa LLP for 300 million tons per year
As part of the Nur-Jailau NA program, work has begun on the construction of corals and fattening places for 3,000 heads of breeding animals
Another project is the construction of a power transmission station with wind included in the Industrialization Map of the region
Since the beginning of the 48 MW production project - 411 million.
tenge mastered
The akimat of the city allocated to KazWindEnergy LLP about 300 hectares of the land plots for construction of power plants with the wind
The partnership is currently negotiating with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance the project
The main professional livestock industry in the region is the high quality of grain
In 2014, 105 centners per hectare of cereals were harvested on an area of ​ ​ 252 thousand hectares
Every year this figure is getting higher
Within the framework of the Program for the development of single-industry towns for the development of livestock for 2013-2015, projects are envisaged to create mill and feed plants in the city
KZT 580 mln allocated from state treasury for implementation of complex projects this year
tenge allocated
The city of Arkalyk is especially mentioned in the Message of the Head of state of 2012: Head of state
Instructed to start the construction of the railway "Arkalyk-Shubarkol"
Since then, work has been actively underway on the construction of housing for the allocation of land
Now 385 people and 120 pieces of equipment are involved in the construction of the railway [4]
As the Head of State noted, this project will give a new impetus to the region - Arkalyk will become a transit city
The 214 km network will reduce the northbound distance by 700 km
Plan completed in the second half of 2014
The ultimate goal of the single-industry program, rather than the repair of the construction of social facilities in cities considered by the same city-forming enterprise, provides, first of all, for the diversification of its production, the creation of opportunities for opening other industries [5]
The economy of cities based on one such industry as a whole depends on world prices
For example, if iron prices change in the global market, this will not affect the city of Temirtau
Also, copper prices directly affect the economic performance of Zhezkazgan
If prices in the world market fall sharply, then it is not surprising that only those cities that look at production fell into crisis
At these enterprises, salaries will begin to decrease, tax revenues are reduced, even factories can be closed
Therefore, it is necessary to create new jobs in single-industry towns and create new industries so that they can feed the country, favorably affecting the city's economy.
In the area of ​ ​ the city of Arkalyk - mineral waters dyeing lead zinc marble
Who is sure that this fossil will be needed by our country
Of course, for the development of minerals, first of all, improving the socio-economic development of the city itself, intensifying its internal structure is the main task

Acceptor ion electron pairs of acid-based interaction of proton and electronic donor theories
In the "Strategy for the development of education of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2015," one of the priority areas of the transition to 12-year education is the formation of effectively functioning educational models and the development of educational methods, the achievement of a high-quality level of education and training that will allow Kazakhstan to take a worthy place among developed countries
Head of State N.
In his Address "Kazakhstan - 2030," Nazarbayev said: "It is necessary that students be brought up as Kazakh-patriotic and creatively developed individuals with a high character of national behavior, with high knowledge of the virtuous qualities of national honor" [1 32-35b]
Education is a prerequisite for the development of the country, and in order to improve the quality of education and bring it into line with standards in the world educational space, it is necessary, first of all, that the content of educational and teaching aids is fully understood and the content of important theories
In the content of inorganic chemistry in large volumes, theories of acid-based interaction are not prescribed
It is also difficult to say that there are enough published articles on theories of acid-based interaction
Therefore, the use of acid-based theories of interaction in inorganic chemistry helps students and specialists in the field of education to engage in scientific research in education
The explanation of chemical processes and these processes in the process of teaching chemistry is primarily his theory
Before explaining the same acid-based interaction, one should first focus on his theory
Providing acid-based interactions
consider three theories of interpretation
This is Arrhenius electrolytic dissociation theory, Brensted-Lowry proton theory, and J.
Lewis Electronic Theory
In 1884, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius proposed the classification of two specific compounds - mustard and base
Based on this theory, the opinion is expressed about the electrolytic dissociation of substances in aqueous solution
If all acids are characterized by H + in solution, the corresponding bases are characterized by OH in solution
The best way to determine the presence of acid and base is determined by changing the color of the litmus paper in an acidic and sound medium.
Red litmus paper is splashed in acidic medium, and blue litmus paper is painted in basic medium
According to Arrhenius's theory (by electrolytic dissociation in an aqueous solution):
acids - compounds forming hydrogen (H +) ions and acid residue when dissociated in aqueous solution
bases - compounds forming hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissociated in aqueous solution
The equation of the acid-base mutual neutralization reaction can be written as follows:
From this, it can be seen that to know the strength of the acid and base, it is enough to determine the concentration of H + and OH- ions in the solution
The main characteristics of acids and bases are defined:
If we talk about the strength of acid and base by arrhenius, then depending on the ionizing properties of acid and base, two types are classified: strong and weak
Acids transmitting the maximum amount of proton (H +) with complete ionization in a strongly acidic solution
At the same time, the dissociation of strong acid and weak acid will differ from the constant
The stronger the acid, the higher the dissociation constant
So, we see that Arrhenius theory applies only to aqueous solutions [2 40-42]
The application of students in the practice of Arrhenius theory can be approved by the following independent tasks:
What substance and what determines the acidity and validity of the medium emanating from the complete neutralization of the acid and each other's base?
Give an example of an acid and a base with a high dissociation constant?
What is arrhenic acid? What is the basis of Arrhenius? Give an example of the acid and base used in everyday life?
Answers:
The acid and the validity of the water-neutral substance and the medium are carried out with the help of pH - meters
To acids with high dissociation constant HClO 4 HI HBr HNO 3 H 2 SO 4 t
Dissociation constant for high bases: NH 3 C 6 H 5 NH 2 (CH3) NH C 2 H 5 NH 2 t
Arrenius acid is the formation of hydrogen ion H + during dissociation of substances
Arrhenius base is characterized by the formation of OH-hydroxide ion during dissociation of substances
Citrus vegetables used in everyday life can serve as a simple example of acid and base
For example, orange lemon grape juice red grated
The following theory explaining the acid-based interaction was proposed by the Danish physicist-chemist Johan Brensted and the English chemist Thomas Lowry in 1923 under the name protolytic (or proton) theory of acid and base.
According to this theory, the acid is called the substances transmitting the proton (or ion), and the base is called the substances adding the proton (or ion)
The process of feeding the proton with acid with the addition of a reversible acid residue serves as a corresponding base with the addition of a repeated proton:
Acid - Base + H +
The mechanism of hydrate formation may vary depending on the nature of the solute
This includes: ion-dipole interaction donor-acceptor interaction dipole-dipole interaction
In accordance with protolytic theory, the acid-based reaction produces a novel acid and base:
Acid	Neg_z2	Acid 2	Basis
Such reactions we call protolysis reactions
The neutralization reaction from protolytic theory is characterized by the transition of the proton from acid to base:
acid	Base of 2 acids
According to protolytic theory, the strength of the acid and base is characterized by a water disposal reaction:
Acid + H2 O - Base + H3O +
Protolytic theory contributed to changing outdated ideas about acids and bases
Unlike electrolytic disociation for water solutions of protolytic theory indicates that the product formed as a result of the interaction of acid and base should be considered as a new mustard and base [3 16-20] [4 451-454]
Examples of exercises for self-control according to the mentioned protolytic theory:
For a direct reaction in each equation, define the acid and the basis according to the protolytic theory of Brensted-Lowry
For a direct reaction in each equation, define the acid and the basis according to the protolytic theory of Brensted-Lowry
For a direct reaction in each equation, define the acid and the basis according to the protolytic theory of Brensted-Lowry
Answers:
a) HClO is a Brensted-Lowry base with loss of H + ion, and NaIO - with addition of H + ion
b)	HF is a Brensted-Lowry basis with loss of H + ion and addition of HS- H + ion
a) from HS itself
Brensted-Lowry acid, having lost the ion, and OH - to himself H +
b) H3ASO4 loses three ions of H + and acid according to Brenstead-Louri, and NaOH is a basis on Brenstead-Louri NaO H, adding each ion of OH +
a) Lose H + ion from HNO itself and get Brensted Lowry acid
NaBrO is the basis of Bransted Lowry with the addition of the ion BrO - H +
b) Obtain Brensted Lowry acid by losing H + ion from HNO itself
is the basis for Brensted Lowry with the addition of an ion
c) H AsO - two of themselves
Brensted-Lowry acid, losing ion and OH - H +
is the basis for Brensted Lowry with the addition of an ion
Lewis proposed and founded the electronic theory of acid and basis
According to Lewis theory, acid is an electronic acceptor, and the base is an electron donor
According to Lewis's theory, acids are substances that have free electron orbits and are able to receive electron pairs that are not divided into these orbits
Substance bases with undivided electron pairs that can be used to create a chemical bond
ion y includes a hydrogen ion in its electron pair, which cannot separate oxygen
ammonia attaches a hydrogen ion to its electron pair, which nitrogen does not separate
Lewis's theory says that ammonia and hydroxide ion are bound to a hydrogen ion due to the fact that they have the same electron pair
Any reaction to Lewis's theory is that ammonia and water use their only electron pairs to construct coordinate bonds.
Acid-based reactions by electronic theory include all actions that form a donor-acceptor bond
For example, the reaction of BF 3 and ammonia:
donor-acceptor linkage
Ammonia connects its only pair of electrons with an empty boron orbital in the BGZ and maintains coordination
Here, the base donor neutralizes ammonia with boron acceptor fluoride
For acid-based reaction, e.g. ammonia and gaseous chlorostetic acid
Which atom takes an electron pair that the nitrogen atom cannot separate? If in some textbooks ammonia sacrifices its only pair of hydrogen ion, then a simple proton surrounds it
However, this leads to errors
Usually you cannot get an empty hydrogen ion in chemical systems
Since hydrogen is very active, it always contacts any atom
HCl has no hydrogen ion not bound
Anywhere in hydrochloric acid there are orbitals capable of receiving electron pairs
Why then is hydrochloric acid a Lewis acid? Since chlorine is more electric than hydrogen, chlorostetic acid is a pole molecule
The chlorine electron in the hydrogen bond is pulled towards the chlorine, whereby hydrogen is positive and chlorine shows the amount of action
The only nitrogen vapor in the protein molecule ammi is slightly attracted to the hydrogen atom in chlorostetic acid
As the nitrogen atom approaches the hydrogen bond between the chlorosutec molecules, the chlorine electron is removed from the chlorine
At the end there is a bond between nitrogen and hydrogen, and the chloride ion is released separately
This can be explained if you look at the following diagram [4 463-464] [5 85-88]
Self-monitoring exercises on the electronic theory of said acid and base
Which of the transmitted ones enters into a chemical bond as the basis of Lewis: NH 3 CH 4 G-ON-? Refine the answer
Determine thermal determination of Lewis acid and base
a) AlCl3 diagram of aluminium chloride with indication of internal electron only
Refine the answer
Answers:
The Lewis base is characterized by the presence of separate pairs of electrons and participation in contact with others
Nitrogen atoms in NH 3 have separate electron pairs, so they can come into contact as a Lewis base
CH 4 due to absence of separate electron pairs
Lewis cannot be the basis
F - has electronic pairs that cannot separate, so Lewis can come into contact as a basis
O'H - the presence of a personal pair in acid proves that it can come into contact as the basis of Lewis
Lewis acid is an electron pair donor in the presence of an electron pair acceptor
a) There is room in the inner orbit of the aluminum atom to create a covalent bond with the reception of a single paired electron
Two aluminum chloride molecules can certainly bind as a Lewis acid
However, in the chlorine atom there is a single pair of electrons that can be used to bond with other compounds
So this can also be Lewis's basis.
As a result, Al2 Cl6
it is formed
In this case, the three theories envisaged can be discussed the application of theories to the interpretation of some interactions with acid and justification
Comparative explanations of references are given in Table 1
Table 1 - Comparison of acid and base definitions
Determination of acids and bases:
In conclusion, the theories of acid-based interaction in inorganic chemistry are considered as one big chapter and without these theories it is impossible to explain some problems of inorganic chemistry
There are several theories of acid-based interaction
In this paper, we cited the basics of applying only the first three theories in inorganic chemistry.
If we explain the acid-based interaction taking into account the above theories, then we believe that this information will at least help applicants and students engaged in scientific work

Figure 1 - IR spectra of glucose (a) and maltose (b)
The second representative of the study series - disaccharide - can be considered as a product of condensation of glucose maltose, one molecule of which loses the hydroxyl group associated with an abnormal carbon atom, and the second molecule - an analog group associated with a fourth carbon atom
Depending on the molecular structure, the IR spectrum of maltose should be identical in nature to the glucose spectrum, but it also has significant features
Some of the devices characteristic of a glucose range in a reference value, in particular voH vCO 8COH 8OCH and figure 1 which is actually weakened or destroyed by 8CCO
Naturally, these bonds change greatly as a result of the formation of a-14-glycoside bubble
If the maltose molecule knows the spectral determination of most chemical bonds [2 3] a (1} 4) with respect to the bond cannot be said
Absorbing strip located in the ranges i 4-10 750-950 930-940 cm - 1140-1175, as it is given in a number of editions [1].
carried
As shown by [11] in the literature, the C-O-C bond is defined by maximums of 1105 and 1150 cm- 1, and in the literature of [3] this bond corresponds to a band of the range 966-993 cm- 1
Information obtained by matching spectra by glucose series homologues with more than two pyranose rings in IR spectra of carbohydrates may be useful in the field of glycosidic linkage identification
The gradual change of the fraction a (1} 4) of the bubble due to an increase or decrease in the length of the molecular chain (degree of polymerization) in the value n has the form of propagation and arrangement in the infrared spectra of the value of individual devices belonging to this type of coupling
Such a practical step will allow to control the evolution of wanted chemical bonds, that is, eliminates the hopping factor and predictable changes in spectra in the relevant devices
The infrared spectra of oligosaccharides differ from the spectra of glucose and maltose in the profile of the most intense band lying between them mainly in the range of 960-1060 cm - 1, Figure 2
Spectral bands far from the specified range are the same for all carbohydrates
The maltose spectrum in this range is similar to oligosaccharides only after strong smoothing
IR spectra of maltheptaose (5) amylose (6)
The results of the graphical analysis showed that the range of 960-1060 cm - 1 for all oligosaccharides studied on the example of the maltotetraose spectrum consists of low-frequency components (Figure 3)
The location of each component in the spectra does not depend on the type of oligosaccharide: in fact, their vertices exceed 986-988 and 1013-1017 cm - 1
In other words, depending on the value of the calculated components, the longer the chain length of the carbohydrate and the proportion of glycoside bonds, the stronger their connection with a minimum frequency, and with a high frequency is less.
The graphical characteristic of this phenomenon is a direct increase in the ratio of the value of the components C1 and C2	in the form of districts (Figure 4)
Figure 3 - Tsur of dominant devices in IR spectra of maltotetraose (a) amylose (b) and amylopectin (c):
1 - profile of experimental spectral structure 2-4 - its zuramdas components
Figure 4 - Maxima in oligosaccharide molecules: 986-988 cm-1 and
Relationship between relative regions of spectral vertices and fractions of glycosidic bonds calculated at 1013-1017 cm '1
If we accept the ratio of spectral devices proposed by the authors [3] of the work, there is a fluctuation of connections a (1 - 4) through the low frequency component
In this case, the intensity of the calculated vertex is defined as the criterion for the presence of C-O-C bridge links and the degree of polymerization of the investigated carbohydrates
However, the estimation requires not the value of the vertex, but its ratio to the spectral band with a small dependence of sugar on the length of the chain
This may be a high frequency component close in intensity to (1-I) or connected to it, that is, the above mentioned
It is supposed that the complex of fluctuations of vCO vCC and 8COH in IR spectrums is defined by this component
Direct correlation between ratio of values of lower and high-frequency components on one side and ratio of a14-glycoside bonds to number of pyranose cycles in sugar molecule is used for calculation of average degree of polymerisation
One pyranose ring is taken as the structural unit of the polymer
Simple formula n = 937/( 5335-S1/C2) is used for calculation, where C1 and C2 are areas of spectral bands of lower and high-frequency components in the range of 960-1060 cm- 1
Thus, the issue of assessing the molecular composition of oligo- saccharides according to IR spectra, as noted in the work [11], can be solved individually
It is interesting to compare the spectrum of the extreme term of the carbohydrate-amylase series with bonds a (1-4) with the spectrum of amylopectin with a high polymer macrocomponent of natural starches
The spectra of the two polysaccharides are very close in frequency and profile to many devices.
Figure 3 in the spectra of amylose and amylopectin with the same relative values, but not related to priority devices of different profile
The bands in question are graphically divided into three components, not two, as oligomers, in amylose - 56/33/11 and amylopectin - 42/48/10
When accessing data, the frequency of vertices increases from left to right
The maximum frequency component provides a dominant maximum in the case of actually determining the shape of the spectral formation of the other two components
Based on the magnitude of these computational bands, the ratio of amylose/amylopectin to substances can be estimated.
In Figure 5, dominant structures in the spectra of different starch derivatives occur between the maxima of amylose and amylopectin
They are similar in profile to the spectrum of polysaccharide and are not prone to formation in the spectrum of amylopectin
Of the starches we examined, there were no samples similar to the profile of amylose formation in the range of 960-1060 cm - 1 spectrum, and none of them had amylopectin
Figure 5 - Amylopectin (1) Table 2 (2-6) and amylose (7) IR spectra of starch samples in the lower region
Thus, oligosaccharides isolated from maltotriose to maltageptaose have similar IR-Fourier spectra
Maltose and amylose are considered as a continuation of this series
The main difference in the spectra of polysaccharides studied is 960-1060 cm- 1	dominant highs in the range
Graphical analysis explains that such maxima are connected with valent fluctuations and-14-glikozidnykh communications from two components some with a low frequency of the second - vCO vCC and complex 8COH of fluctuations
The ratio of the values ​ ​ of the lower and high-frequency components is associated with the amount of bubble in molecules a (1} 4) in individual canes, so it can be used to describe the degree of polymerization of given substances
A study of the IR spectra of amylose and amylopectin starches in the range 960-1060 cm- 1 showed that the profile of the spectral devices of these substances does not differ from amylose
Hydrogen bonds water clusters "structural memory water" biogenization antientropic biogenerator hydroplasm iodophilic water
The special development of global technologies in recent years gives rise not only to great discoveries in science, but also to threats of environmental disasters
The main problem is the preservation of drinking water necessary for human life, completely preserved biologically
It is believed that water was exclusively a liquid medium for biochemical reactions in an insoluble cell
A creature that creates its own special molecular properties and systems of permanent inequalities, the true absolute conditions necessary for a special life
The quality of water we use depends on both quality of life and health.
Water reserves on the planet are sufficient, but water quality is not the same in all places
And over time, excess waste generated by man-made civilization can become a real disaster for people
Application of new methods of purification at the stage of solving the issue of conservation of natural clean waters or their removal from risks, increase of biological activity of waters and restoration of their natural potentials
Aquamira water, obtained as a result of an innovative technology similar to the natural water purification route proposed by the staff of the Department of Biophysics and Biomedicine of Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, which forms the basis of the study
The reason for this is the SCO processed at the production and technical base with an innovative patent for the biogenization of specially issued water "Syrat"
Consequently, b. KazNU named after al-Farabi
To understand the work of the Aquamira water biogenizing structure, created by biophysicists under the leadership of Professor Viktor Mikhailovich Inyushin, it is necessary to hear processes that occur in natural conditions in water
A substance in which water can be in several cavities according to the latest scientific data [1], in gaseous liquid plasma states (including from the vacuum of a physical substance)
The liquid phase is easily connected to each other via a hydrogen bond [2], but this bond consists of water molecules that are 10 times weaker than conventional covalent bonds
A hydrogen bond occurs between a hydrogen atom in one molecule of water and an even electron of an oxygen atom in the next molecule of water
Water molecules enter the motions by sequential bonding and rupture
causes "acclimatic" properties, as a result of which it causes surface stress of water and lifts it along the latitude of large trees due to the force of hydrogen bonds up to several tens of meters - this indicates the "cohesion" of water
(Cohesion is called the force that causes a small part of one substance to "stick" to the particle of another)
Due to these hydrogen bonds, water always changes its structure as a result of any external effects: mechanical (for example, when draining water from container to container) chemical (changing the structure of the water molecule from the ingress of one reagent into the water in accordance with its active centers) and electromagnetic (due to the influence of various rays, wave fluctuations of a substance with disruption of hydrogen bonds are also observed)
Particular attention is paid to the properties of water, especially due to hydrogen bonds, when molecules can create liquid crystal clusters and create their structure (O.
With any external effect on water, for example, under the influence of a magnetic field, it is possible to change its structure for a long time (water storage)
The more complex the cluster is created (the more molecules), the stronger it is (for a long time), because water always tries to spontaneously design, and water can replenish the missing lands due to its memory structure, that is, it independently supplements the missing places of the cluster with free water molecules [4]
Hydroplasm is an antientropic plasma structure that plays a large role in preserving the cluster structure of water [5]
That is, the biological activity of water depends on its plasma construction.
The plasma phase of water consists of charged particles (proton and electron ions) or quasi-neutral (the set of charges is zero) and consists of physical vacuum particles
Free particles in water occur constantly and continuously during dissociation (decomposition) of a water molecule (for example, ionization of conventional solar radiation) and during gas diffusion occurring on the surface of water [6]
75% of the human body consists of water
And the brain consists of 85% water, so it is especially sensitive to dehydration
The brain is constantly washed with saline cerebrospinal fluid
Chemical findings about the human body showed that all the games of researchers are accompanied by minor changes in the molecular composition of the body and its concentration of solids
The result was the emergence of a new chemical or pharmaceutical direction of the human body - the medical-industrial system [7]
Fully equate physiological processes in living body cells with the results of all biochemical reactions
These processes take place in an aqueous environment, that is, water is a mandatory participant in these processes [8]
Therefore, all biochemical reactions are consumed by energy, i.e., freer charge particles pass more qualitatively than with hydroplasm in the cell fluid
Since Albert Saint-Dierdyi discovered hydroplasm, and the results of studies of the properties of hydroplasm have become clearly understood the role of water as a source of life [9]
If you look at the Aquamira biophysical technological path of water biogenization, then the liquid crystalline and plasma phases of water are closely related to each other and cannot live with each other, because they form together, and one of them can go to the other.
Molecules break down into ions, and ions again form a molecule, combining with a conventional covalent bond
Molecules of one water join clusters through hydrogen bonds, and other clusters break down into molecules
This is how continuous processes go in each aqueous solution
Production of Aquamira biogenic water will be carried out at the production and technical base of the Syrat water processing plant, as an innovative patent for water biogenization technology was received under the partnership agreement
The biogeneration process is divided into three stages: laser activation of biogenation on an antientropic generator and referral to a special reactor to create iodophilic hydroplasm (Figure-1)
Figure 1 - Complete process diagram of production of Aquamira biogenic water where: 1 - self-washer; Laser activation of water 2: 3-ozone generator; 4-zeolitic filters; Membrane filters 5; 6-ultraviolet disinfectant; 7 - biostructuring zurum; 8 shows an iodophilizing device; Quartz filter 9
Before biogenization, the water of the artesian well is pre-purified, taken from a depth of one hundred and twenty meters from the territory of the Ili Alatau
For primary water treatment, a special coal filter is used, which is located in the mine of the filter pit in the place ending with the purification of the water from which it is washed
The arrangement of filters in this order corresponds to the natural water turnover in normal natural conditions
In the production of Aquamira biogenic water, reverse osmosis filters are not used, since hydrogen bonds between molecules are broken in water passing through such filters and the cluster device of water is eliminated
And the biological activity of such "water with a broken structure" is very low, that is, distilled water will remain only this summer
And due to the use of distilled water, as a result of which the body loses the necessary mineral substances along the tissues of the body, health is harmed by a violation of the metabolism process
At the stage of laser activation, the water of the artesian well undergoes primary purification
Under the action of the laser, the movement of "laser activation" of water into the plasma phase is observed: due to the ions formed from the decay of the water molecule, charged particles increase
Hydroplasm prevails in water and a phenomenon of instability and energy enrichment of water arises
Before the second stage, the water is completely preserved from any microorganisms entering the water, undergoing additional treatment through the ozonator and ultraviolet disinfectants.
Water also passes through zeolitic and membrane filters
At the same time, the situation taking into account "activated water" reflects its active properties on the surface of solutes, so you should know this when treating water.
Filter drains must be replaced periodically for water treatment to be effective
At the stage of water construction, the structure of the biogenerator causes an antientropic field, as a result of which the stable structure of the plasma corresponds to the natural pathway of molecular clusters in ordinary living cells, due to which biogenic water in the human body
will be good assimilation
If we compare between water under construction and water with a destroyed structure (that is, having no large clusters in construction), then activated water contains empty cavities covered with large-scale space collected in the class.
For example, a crystal that occupies a large space compared to an ice water state is as crystallized as an ice cluster, but it is "liquid"
And charged parts of hydroplasm fill empty cavities between cluster molecules and easily enter biochemical reactions
Such a biogenic property of Aquamira water can be used for long-term food storage without disturbance, since biogenic water is resistant to natural oxidation processes, that is, it is not disturbed even when food substances are stored in biogenic water
Due to the biological activity of Aquamira water, body cells energetically enrich and drink a drink, while the number of drugs taken in the treatment is much less and the effectiveness of treatment will be higher
The mechanism of this is explained by the homeopathic effect of biogenic water, which consists in the fact that biogenic water molecules are located around a real target and, using their cluster properties, repeatedly enhance a copy of the properties of water-soluble substances and store them in cluster memory [10]
Spa Department of the Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan Research Institute of Cardiology
Aquamira water proposed to be used in the prevention of the cardiovascular system and cancer
In addition, in the course of additional experimental studies conducted on the basis of the Kazakh National University named after Asfandiyarov, biogenic water provided great assistance in reducing the incidence of the laboratory animal population
Vistar received 70 copies from each group of white linear rats
Rats of all groups were poisoned daily with CO 2 NO 2 CO air containing dioxide radicals
The content of lead chromium in drinking water of animals is twice the possible dose of zinc
On the diet of animals of the experimental group, 50% of biogenic water is added daily
Duration of experiments for three months (90
days)
Pathohistochemical studies were carried out on peripheral liver blood, the dynamics of bio- physical indicators are controlled by the intensity of biochemoluminescence (BHL)
Seven animals from the control group died twenty days later, as a result of their study, it was found that the intensity of BHL in the blood plasma of parenchymal liver necrosis increased 2-3 times
And only one of the experienced group died
In the last 90s, 52 people died in the observation group, and among those who drink biogenic water, 11 animals
The results of medical and biological studies were fully convinced that the biogenic "Aquamira" expressed antioxidant properties of water
Workers in the metallurgical and chemical industries often have hypersension- bilitation of immunity, expressed in allergic reactions, and such reactions
negatively affects the blood-liver-kidney system
The antioxidant effect of Aquamira biogenic water is also useful for the prevention of toxic effects of dioxide on heavy metals due to the characteristic biophysical structure of Aquamira biogenic water is an effective way to prevent iron-making anemia, and with the frequent use of Aquamira biogenic water, allergic reactions
Aquamira biogenic water is used in hot shops when cooking in table working drinks and the first liquid dishes (tea compote soups) in countless quantities, and before eating it is better to drink without interrupting even a simple desert
Such beverages will be additional measures to protect against highway diseases of the urinary tract, since its content of biogenic water contributes to the rapid dissolution of calcium carbonate crystals
Thus, Aquamira biogenic water, in addition to the general therapeutic effect, brings economic benefits, reducing the incidence of workers in metallurgical and chemical industries, increasing the working capacity of workers and workers
Aquamira biogenic water can be fully used in industries that produce all food products that use water, since this water is expensive, maintaining the quality of food
added ingredients will make effective without loss, since biogenic water, together with the useful side of the products, enhances the quality of taste
The technology of natural purification of such water and the biological construction of water can also be seen on water sources in all man-made zones, such as Aquamira water.
On the territory of the Semipalatinsk test site, on the territory of the Baikonur cosmodrome and the adjacent territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where the same explosion occurred, it will be better to use this water
After biogenization processes, the plant attempts to convert biogenic water in connection with the creation of iodophilic hydroplasm in a special reactor
"Aquamira iodophilic" promotes the effective uptake of iodine ions by follicular cells (Figure 2) that do not contain iodine ion in biogenic water but penetrate thyroid cells
Aquamira iodophilic biogenic water is behind its natural technology
Figure 2 - Diagram of the effect of iodophshore biogenic algae "Aquamira yod" on the cells of their tsaltsanchik gland:
1 - biogenic water enters special reactors for iodophilisation; 2 - iodophilic hydroplasm of biogenic water is formed in the reactor; 3 - when feeding iodophilic water
updates cooling of thyrocytes; 4 - the glands of tsaltsansha begin to more actively absorb iodine ions entering the body
Aquamira iodophilic biogenic water, due to the curious specifics of its natural technology, overcomes thirst not only by increasing the concentration of iodine in the body, but also by enhancing the conductivity of cell membranes in all products entering the body
Water "Aquamira iodophilic" - bioactivator is an alternative to active iodine that restores the natural functions of thyroid cells
In the pharmacy of experimental medicine "Research Institute of Cardiology and Internal Diseases" of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan in a bottle of water "Aquamira iodophilic"
conducted several serial studies of the effects of laboratory animals on thyroid services
According to the results of experiments, biostructural water "Aquamira iodophilic" is used as therapeutic mineral water in remission and euthyroid conditions
Also revealed biological activity of iodophilic water "Aquamira," as well as iodine drugs
Used these properties of water and to increase the performance of blacks, enhancing the adaptive stability of the body in conditions where the body has individually unacceptable reactions to iodine drugs
Aquamira iodophilic water has also been proven to be involved in the complete processing of iodine from nutrients and waters
"Aquamira fitnes" is the following type of biogenic water produced by the Syrat plant
To obtain the Aquamira fitnes biogenic water, the water is cleaned from the well and then held in the laser activation stage for a long time (Figure 1)
As a result, in treated water, the plasma stage becomes higher than biogenic water, which has not been modified due to the large amount of decomposition of water molecules.
Therefore, in modified biogenic water there are many hydroplasms that restore the energy supply of lost living cells in the human body
This is due to the fact that the modified Aquamira fitnes biogenic water was made specifically for athletes
Long-term use of Aquamira fitnes biogenic water will increase muscle training quality several times, reduce meat fatigue and reduce recovery time
In order to make sure that Aquamira fitnes biogenic water is in favor, studies were carried out on athletes of the Dynamo Moscow Water Polo club
During the first ten days, the studied athletes increase endurance, increase performance, reduce the time to restore injuries and normal general health of the body
On the pages of some athletes pigment spots were removed, the blows of four athletes intensified
These rates were maintained for ten days after the cessation of water intake
The leaders of the Dynamo Moscow Water Polo Club offer to drink Aquamira fitnes biogenic water to all other athletes and people living healthy active so that they can quickly recover from all training and other hard work
The potential of the plant C "Syrat" is not limited only to the production of biogenic waters "Aquamira iodophilic" and "Aquamira fitnes"
Deep study of "structural memorization" of water will reveal new more special modifying properties of biogenic water and will create conditions for its application in medicine and food production in all areas of human life in heavy engineering and agriculture
Already, with complete confidence, we can talk about possible structural changes in the water, and we again see that they are limitless

Effect of phospinol on the productivity of various crop seeds
Crop yields are due to many factors: the use of modern agricultural measures depends on varieties and hybrids of high-grade grain in connection with soil-climatic conditions of land landscaping
Recently, the introduction and use of new types of bioactive substances (BAS) is of great importance for intensifying plant cultivation.
Studies of the territory of administration and use of biologically active substances, which are the sole cause of plant growth, are of particular importance for the recent growth of grain yields resistant to abiotic and biotic factors.
The scientific work investigated the effect of biologically active substances (phosphinol) on the reproduction of seeds of various crops
As a result of studies, it was found that phosphinol at various concentrations has a stimulating or inhibitory effect
results of the seed productivity study
In the study, it was found that the concentration of phosphinol does not have the same effect on different seeds
It was found that chip seeds are sensitive to all concentrations of fospinol
Soil biologically active substance stimulant inhibitors

The purpose of the study is the state of the fauna of shrubs living on woody vegetation in the city of Almaty
Collection and study of shrubs were carried out by general methods for general entomology [3-5]
Information about the fauna of semi-deserts in Almaty is very small [1 2]
Translucent are the largest order of diverse insects
Among the shrubs there are predatory or mixed nutritional species, but plant species prevail
Some of them harm rural and forest plants
For the city of Almaty, trees are of great importance
Their sanitary and hygienic role in the protection against dust and smoke, in addition to decorative quality, is of great importance
Trees protect the air from toxic pollution, including the retention of radioactive deposits prevents their further spread, that is, cutting down trees deprives them of important unification in self-cleaning air
Nevertheless, harmful shrubs lead to the fact that they reproduce with various diseases
Most of them feed on seeds with vegetable juice

Effects of stress on cellular immunity (blood elements) in the human body
The article will address the effects of stress on the body's immune system
The studies provide elements of blood content
In modern society, a normal state of stress has developed, as a result of which renal hormones impede the work of cells of the immune system, the body's resistance to infectious diseases decreases, and various tumors appear
In this case, early diagnosis is necessary, since in the case of timely application of the correct medical measures, various severe somatic diseases may occur
These include ischemic brain diseases (due to disorders of the brain's immune system) One of the most common diseases is latent herpetic infection, which is activated in general immunosuppression
Experiments to learn the effects of stress on blood elements made in rats
With immobial lysation stress in rats, the ratio of monocytes and lymphocytes to changes in the blood of stick nuclear neutrophils and segment nuclei was observed
From these studies, it turned out that due to the effect of immobilization stress on the animal's body, the number of monocytes is larger in size than other blood elements (0877 ± 0635 ng/ml R < 005)
The lowest indicator of this stress was manifested in segment nuclear neutrophils (024 ± 012 ng/ml R < 005)
Results of studies are presented as diaramma
And their meaning is revealed
The authors presented their own methods to combat stress and prevent immunodeficiency and restore the body
Keywords: stress immobilization stress central nervous system segment-nuclear and stick nuclear neutrophils monocytes lymphocytes

Investigation of the possibility of using small-containing wastes as flame retardant and antiseptic
This scientific article provides for the technology of processing waste containing boron in the historical collection of sludge stored at the former chemical plant
Composition of analysed wastes is determined and flame retardant components are obtained from boron-containing wastes
The removed compounds were experimentally tested on wooden samples (pine pine)
According to the results of the test, wood samples treated with boron flame retardant are less damaged with prolonged combustion compared to the untreated version
At the same time, exceeding the boron concentration in the compound of the tested solutions gives an effective result in damage and spontaneous combustion
The experiments made it possible to recycle boron-containing wastes as flame retardants in such a way as to have the value of consuming harmful wastes, proving that they are necessary for impregnating trees in the production of building materials.

Methods of plant selection polyploidy heterosis mutation
Modern achievements in the field of genetics and molecular biology include the formation of new methods and active introduction to science
Among the new genetics methods used in plant breeding:
3) obtaining mutations under the influence of chemical and physical mutagens
Selection	vegetation	grades	microorganisms	stamps	release
sciences studying methods of renewal and biological basis
"Selection" means sorting
The main goal of plant breeding is to breed and improve sick varieties of plants that provide the necessary productivity for a human child.
The main task of plant breeding is the introduction into production of new varieties of crops that meet the requirements of intensive agriculture with high quality drought and cold for patients and pests
One of the groups of each species of plants that in modern conditions produce the highest quality crop is called crop variety
The biological management characteristics and shape of plants belonging to the same class should be the same and be evaluated by these indicators
Each variety will fully comply with the soil conditions in a particular zone.
Only then will it give a stable product annually
Product quality will also be high
We will now describe the basic plant breeding methods mentioned above [1]
Polyploidy refers to genomic mutations caused by a change in the number of chromosomes of a cell
If the chromosomal collection of cells of eukaryotic organisms exceeds twice, then such organisms are called polyploid
Polyploidy is common in nature
This is especially common on flowering plants
Polyploidy can also occur due to the effect and hybridization of intrinsic-external factors on the phases of mitosis meiosis cell division
This phenomenon is rare in animals
Vegetation
increase their productivity by counterfeiting polyploidy phenomena
For example, scientists took a polyploid species with the treatment of beet seeds with a solution of alkaloid colchicine and introduced it into the farms of the South Kazakhstan region
Selects polyploid plant species in nature under environmental conditions without human participation
Therefore, more than half of the plant world is polyploid
Among agricultural plants, in addition to wheat, there are polyploid cotton banana potatoes and other types of cultivated plants
Polyploid organisms are divided into 3p-triploid 4-tetraploid 5-pentaploid depending on the degree of multiplicity of the number of chromosomes
Polyploid organisms formed as a result of multiple reproduction of genomes of homogeneous species, alloploids are called artid or amphiploids
Alloploids are formed by crossing subspecies
For example, if there is a gene A and B in the body, allopolyploid AABB derived from it
As an example, for the first time in 1924 by crossing (intergenerational crossing) the swimsuit and cabbage G.
Karpchenko amphidiploid can be obtained
Because of this, the plant combines the signs of a swimsuit and cabbage, it turned out to be very strong
Then such a new form is systemically derived from the fusion of plant genomes belonging to each genus [2]
Polyploidy leads to a change in body traits, so it is an important source of variability in evolution and selection, especially in plant evolution and selection
An increase in the volume of cells and organs of the polyploid forms of the plant (leaf flower fruit), as well as an increase in the number of chemicals, a change in the fertility period is observed
This feature is that screams are more common on pollen plants
Polyploidy is of great importance in the evolution of wild and cultivated plants
There is an assumption that a third of all plants were also formed as a result of polyploidy of some groups of animals (especially partonogenetic)
In heterosis, the viability of the hybrid increases compared to parents
But this property begins to gradually decline in subsequent generations
The phenomenon of heterosis is often used in plant and animal breeding
This phenomenon first appeared in 1914 by the American scientist V.
Shell notices corn
According to Shell's experience, products of the first generation of heterosic maize hybrid showed a decrease in second generation products by 35% - in the third generation by 50%
Swedish scientist heterosis A
As Gustafson found out, plants have several species
This is sexual heterosis - due to the good development of the genitals, the production of seeds and fruits increases
Injection of heterosis-vegetative organs of the body
Adaptive heterosis - caused by increased viability of plants adapted to the environment
You can get quality by crossing a wild species with a crop variety of plants
For example, carabidai and wheat have hybrids of wild cereals, which are called wheat and ectops
In order to study heredity and from the point of view of selection, researchers involved in artificial mutagenesis of plants have an important task - to obtain directed mutations
The solution to this problem is proved by the specificity of the effects of various mutagens and the modification of the genetic effects of mutagens due to other additional factors
Artificially derived mutants increase the variety of cult forms of interest to the breeder and open a wide path for further sorting and hybridization
In mutational selection, chemical mutagens induce a set of selectably useful and previously unknown properties, which are pleotropic macromutation and physiological micromutations that produce completely new resources in living organisms
They extend the range of variability compared to other agents and cause deviations
Chemical mutagens found in genetic experiments take place in selection practice due to wide excretion of variability
In modern selection works between various chemical mutagens of different structure of organic compounds not belonging to the class of nucleotides
uses
Such substances are very strong, but mildly affect heredity and variability
Their effect on hereditary material can be controlled depending on the state in which the experiment was conducted on the selected and administered dose
For a long time, the study of the chemical mutagenesis process focuses on the use in these compounds
They are also given less attention, even if the study of the phenomenon of chemical mutagenesis begins with inorganic chemical mutagenesis
Because many of them are weak
This makes selection work difficult with toxin action leading to cell death of heavy metals
Strong chemical mutagens are distinguished by different effects on cells of living organisms, i.e. mitosis retardation: cell death or inhibition (cytotoxic and cytostatic action) carcinogenic and accelerated and t
it is visible
When testing low-temperature mutagens, acceleration of plant growth and development was revealed
The effect of supermutagens is expressed in the rapid growth, reduction of the passage time of individual phases of development from living plant masonry
The effect of accelerating chemical mutagens does not depend on the values ​ ​ of the compounds and the sensitivity of the body, but depends on the species and variety differences of plants in dose on the nature of chemical agents
The response of each plant may be the same in quantitative quality per dose of the mutagen accelerator
The manifested ability immediately after exposure is preserved in some cases until the end of the plant vegetation, and sometimes manifested in the second generation
Here, depending on the activity of enzymes, a place is given for the ability to modify growth
Very strong chemical mutagens have very high chromosomal abberations, i.e. isochromatide deletion-duplication translocations of microfragments cause interchromosomal symmetries or asymmetric exchanges and, in addition, various gene mutations and expand the limits of variability
It is also possible to achieve an increase in this relation to the gene mutation by selecting a dose of the mutagen
Among chemical mutagens, compounds causing gene mutations are more common than chromosomal mutations [3]
As a result of studies of the genetic impact of radioactive rays, first conducted in 1925 by yeast bacteria, Soviet scientists G
Irradiation has been shown to increase mutation rate hundreds of times compared to natural frequency
Later, a number of researchers determined the effect of radiation on the formation of mutations in high-stage corn-barley wheat
The method of radiation selection appeared as a result of the achievements of science and technology
According to this method, breeders have the opportunity to produce many rare new species in nature
The problem that cannot now be solved by certain selection methods can be solved by exposure to ionizing radiation [4]
Mutagenic factors are now important in improving crop varieties and producing new species
Today, no one doubts the prospects of the radiation mutagenesis method among these factors in plant breeding
The work of scientists in many countries has proved that using this method it is possible to obtain materials with rare traits of nature in order to involve them in solving a number of problems, for example, changing individual traits without much danger to other traits, as well as overcoming the rupture of hereditary traits.

In the Address of the Head of State "Strategy" Kazakhstan-2050 ": the new political course of the held state" The Balapan program has been extended until 2020 [1]
IG RK previously had to explain the significance of the Balapan program
The goal of the state program, consisting of five stages, is to provide preschool children with kindergartens
Children who will be trained in the home and kindergarten, built as part of the program, should have educational significance for the formation of a future personality that does not only have food and care
Currently, the first stage of child development with a priority direction of upbringing - the first stage of education and upbringing - kindergarten
Daytime night bedroom with play hours, breakfast or evening meals, kindergarten
From early childhood, drawing certain actions shows such abilities as singing in a certain musical instrument, drawing.
But if these abilities are shaped and do not develop systemically, then this property cannot be focused on the future professional life of a young teenager with age and gradually disappears.
In the process of raising children, we largely fear them and prohibit many things
Bans in the Kazakh mentality "It's embarrassing to do this" "Don't say what the country says?" interfere with the imagination of the child.
A child needs some freedom to clearly monitor his or her abilities and capabilities
Often we hear many parents forbid children in childhood to "Break dishes": "The plate merges."
But when children remember: "My daughter - in a lazy house does nothing, she does not leave her room until the evening" - also do not lie to complain
Therefore, when you work, you must constantly take care of the child, helping him to expand his outlook and develop a worldview if a child comes to you.
A Growing Child Asks Questions
They want to know a lot
Many parents are indifferent to the child's interest: "I am tired of the restless diamond work" or "Answer later"
And do not get an answer to questions -
a child has less interest in learning knowledge
On the contrary, if you answer questions widely at this time, then the child does not distance himself from his parents and the worldview expands, and the iPad avoids negative actions, such as playing on a mobile phone, does not get carried away with food that harms his health, like chipsy coca-cola
The existence of a negative event of current cruelty suggests that the development of extremism is manifested in the development of generations due to the lack of education in the upbringing of the family, where cruelty between young people passes to other religious concepts, including religious ones.
This is the concept of raising a child who thinks in society, since childhood brings up the love of parents Love of the Fatherland.
Since childhood, the child is aware of the importance of the mother tongue, teaching the child to speak the mother tongue
"Around" "Kalkam" "Botashym" should be taught to correctly compose the composition of the word, and sometimes correctly pronounce the wrong words of the child of parents
Kazakh national speeches will not be superfluous for child from youth
Currently, school-age children and university students are not free to speak out.
Sometimes a teacher who raised children in kindergarten without being a specialist speaks and makes measures for the child such as running and jumping
To raise a child, a kindergarten teacher, that is, a specialist, must adapt to 3 groups in order to improve their worldview for everyone without taking into account the age characteristics of the child
In general, 3 groups require the creation of a special program for kindergarten itself
"First Step"
"Zerek child"
"We're going to school."
In this regard, our experiment will develop linguistic and mental abilities with national specificities.
Therefore, I had to propose a special "Alphabet of national worldview"
Depending on age:
Alpha National Upbringing
Alphabet of the native language
National Alphabet of History
The national alphabet of nature should cover chapters
Parents learn to communicate with children and at home
To develop the system of continuous cognitive education, the child needs to prepare specialists who can determine the direction of the child's development with education in a special kindergarten
We also have the basis of national education K.
It is unlikely that the national toy "Ball Ball" will be introduced into kindergarten depending on the age of the child and will contribute to the improvement of the national language
Al-Farabi: "The evil enemy of education-humanity, who gave man the very first uneducated education without education, and in the future poses a threat to his life," is how the teacher and teacher pay great attention to the worldview issue aimed at educating famous people of our time.
The campaigns of the Kazakh people on the birth of a child and its full formation have been taken from ancient times from folk literature
His desire for a cradle attached great importance to the development of the worldview of the family, in which everyone works, became adults
For example, a grandmother can be called a lullaby
In addition, arrangements of national music will be formed in the children's lullaby
Together with the phenomena occurring in the development of this child, the family should actively intervene in the development of his thinking
National traditions in the upbringing of children contribute to the development of the cognitive side of the child in the further development of his life
The next stage in the life of the child "Landing on a horse" will be aimed at identifying phenomena in the pre-match space using the ritual tradition "Sundeting"
The child of the city will tend to raise the cognitive problem of self-consciousness to ask parents about what is happening around him
In expanding the national educational worldview of Kazakhstan, according to my botanist neighbor, it is necessary to know the features of four species of animals with these names
In the traditions of our people, paying special attention to friendly well-being, raised a young child in friendly relations with adults
"Give your hand to Coken" teaches: "Take Agang's hand"
At this time, the older grandparents said: "Oh, there was a citizen!" "Be taudai!"
Introducing a child to such piety from his youth serves as a basis for becoming a polite and personal person
Now the role of father and grandmother really weakened a little when he came to be raised
Grandmothers, who eavesdrop on their grandson's fairy tale and give it to her will, blushed
The current program of the Head of State "Balapan" is not only the construction of a house and a kindergarten, but also the upbringing of a child as a person
It is necessary to provide a dictionary fund of a foreign language with increased respect and love for the mother tongue of the child
The meaning of the mother tongue from this will lose little, on the contrary, understands the advantage of the mother tongue in comparison with a foreign
The foreign language program should begin with kindergarten, training in the market economy, unlike in other countries where our children, in addition to their native language, are comprehensive children who speak a foreign language
Market economy information that meets modern requirements is provided in a foreign language
In most cases, Kazakh is narrowed if you enter a foreign language
At present, with technological progress, the requirements and direction for children have changed
The global system of comprehensive child education has changed so much that it is easy to come up with a national educational approach to bringing to the child any new technical concepts
In this regard, parents and educator must be brought up in accordance with modern requirements
The misunderstanding of the word "Freedom" that public places are in the wrong direction of educational work among JI students and school-age children suggests that all this suggests that national traditions of raising a child need to begin with kindergarten
In the further development of the national language, kindergarten education is of great importance
The production of toys by national types of toys from the Western country is legal
Why does the young state still not pay attention to such issues of JI and MES specialists? Today, knowledge of a foreign language is a global demand, therefore, in improving the education and science system, which has been in demand at the world level since childhood, the training of specialists occupies a special place
The National Plan "100 Concrete Steps" announced by the Head of State - the invention of new scientific and technical innovative advances in the education system, which have undergone major changes at the global level
The backlog of technological systems in the development of all sectors of the economy creates great difficulties in the adoption by new developing States of new technological methods in many developed countries
The level of education in the former Soviet Union is recognized as classical
The current young state lags behind the development of a world-class education system, together with a big obstacle to the development of a market economy
To implement this idea of the President, the new BG Ministry proposed to change natural science disciplines in schools, as well as conduct chemical mathematics of computer science in English
At the same time, "the transition of humanitarian disciplines will change."
[2] The proposal of such a ministry raises many objections
The main reason is the lack of readiness of teachers to teach in English.
The reasons for such an objection are as follows: "To introduce any innovations of the education system abroad without training in our Ministry of Education"
Former ministers reacted irresponsibly to us with the introduction of an incompatible foreign education system
Many intellectuals in the general society in the field of education and science themselves consider the new minister - "infringes and infringes the Kazakh language" [3] - we, as the leader of our country at the world level, should consider ways to learn English, getting rid of the old dogmatic thought, in order to become the basis of the entire market economy and the entire industry, which is the basis for knowing how to solve the crisis.
English is a science and technology of education, since trade is the diplomatic language of the country, almost 80% of all civilized developed countries are well versed in English
Due to the fact that our Kazakh language is rich, but in Soviet times it was depressed with the dominance of the Russian language, the Russian language expands and harms it, which leads to eternity until today, many officials "switch the word from Kazakh to Russian," and at home the Russian language prevails in the family
To whom are the lungs? We ourselves must develop the Kazakh language with the study of a foreign language and form a national consciousness
Language of the nation The development of the state under the nation depends on the development of the language of the nation
"Your tongue is forever," he said.
Therefore, the scientific and methodological center "Geography and Ecology" at KazNUP named after Abaya presented several foreign languages ​ ​ in kindergarten, creating a program for the development of the Kazakh language for its development
Only in universities, and not in schools, the predominance of a foreign language should be in English to become a specialist in comprehensive knowledge
For example, KazNPP named after Abay has textbooks and teaching aids for teachers
To avoid corruption, the teacher educates his knowledge and specialists to be a comprehensive person to honesty
Therefore, we take part in foreign conferences and replace them with students
We expand the knowledge of specialists by inviting educated professors there
When concluding an agreement with foreign partners for the implementation of this project KazNP named after Abay, we use new methodological directions, not textbooks, and the application of their achievements in them will learn from us success
According to the new minister - "500 thousand children studying in Russian schools do not speak Kazakh" [4]
Everyone speaks Russian so that the children of them are children, especially officials, as well as young people on the street
They are proud that instead of developing a language that speaks Kazakh, a foreigner speaks Russian well and speaks Russian
Instead, Kazakhs should understand that they are well versed in English and are the key to the development of science and technology at the modern world level
The novelty of all new technologies in the development of world space in English is the basis for the development of our science as a country in the world.
Grandfather Abay - "I did not know that at my age there is science, and did not think that I would die" - the eldest of us, speaking English, understands the importance of the native language of our country
It is necessary to be ready to love the Motherland - the Child of the Mother Tongue through our maternal education about the nationality of the word "fathers," that the cultural heritage in 100 volumes is unique with Kazakh drinking literature
Today we can say with confidence that a multilingual educational program related to the development of Kazakhstan and international integration processes is supported in the Kazakh education system
State program "Balapan" extended until 2020
Central Communications Service	briefing to inform on the implementation of the new unified national testing format
Trilingualism is not supported by teachers

Final Occupation
Speaking about some practical works performed in this elective course:
Organism	starch in tissues	I	glycogen definition
Necessary funds:	beer shivers sugar	starch potatoes	Acetic acid solution trichloride 10% solution in ice quartz sand iodine CI of green apple wheat seeds
cups crystallizers Funnel Buchner (or just funnel) filter gauze flask 100 ml tube tripod alcohol lamp
Preparation and creation of experience
Pre-isolated from yeast
For this purpose 10 g of beer yeast are purified from wort and filtered and mixed with 20% sugar solution 200 ml
The mixture was allowed to stand at 25 ° C for 3 hours.
The autopsy process is going well, glycogen accumulates in the shake cell
In a Buchner funnel, the mixture was filtered with the addition of quartz sand (5 g) 25 ml with a 10% solution of trichlorinated acetic acid at 0 ° C (after cooling in a cooling chamber on an ice crystallizer).
Filter the mixture again and drain the filtrate into a flask
Acetic acid with trichloro allows protein to precipitate
Starch cooks clayster (net) seeds of green apple wheat from potato slice
To demonstrate the experience, 10 ml of glycogen and starch solution were poured into two tubes for each
Iodine solution of 2-3 drops in CI is added
The test tube with glycogen is painted red-brown, and the starch-blue-violet changes to purple
Glycogen and starch are polysaccharides and are nutrients in the body
The question to the conclusion of the experience: what is the difference in the color of the test tube? (With different structure of this starch and glycogen)
Both contain a-glucose residues, but have a branched glycogen structure
Then seeds of green apple wheat are treated with iodine from potato cut.
Q: What substances have accumulated in plant tissues? What function does starch perform in the plant body?
After cooling, the paint is restored
What is the reason for removing paint when heating? (Discard color due to change in starch chain structure
Iodine destroys amylopectin branched structure complex
According to developed practices, students draw conclusions about various structures of polysaccharides of plant and animal origin
For proteins, two can be indicated - the biuretic and xanthoprotein reaction
All proteins give a biuretic reaction, since as a result they form a copper complex with a peptide bond in a protein molecule
The biuretic reaction can be produced by gelatin with meat and egg protein, where the result shows the similarity of the structure of the protein molecule
Unlike the biuretic reaction of the xanthoprotein reaction, it is not shown by all proteins, but only by part of aromatic amino acids, which are essential proteins for the human body.
The purpose of this practice is to show the diversity of amino acids in the composition of a protein and determine the degree of its nutritional value
Remedies: Test tubes filter paper egg white meat part gelatin concentrated nitric acid sodium hydroxide solution or ammonia (people's alcohol)
Preparation and creation of experience
Concentrated nitric acid is buried in egg white solution
The liquid in the tube is heated, it is precipitated and dissolved
After cooling, the ammonia or sodium hydroxide solution is gradually added and colored purple (orange)
The reaction occurs with the formation of nitrocos from aromatic amino acids
Makes this experience with gelatin as well
Gelatin is washed with cold water to purify another protein mixture in the formulation.
Gelatin is nauseous and compresses it between filter paper
Xanthoprotein reaction is carried out by dissolving water in test tube with heating of small part
The reaction is negative, since in the gelatin component there is no aromatic or cyclic amine, and sometimes a weak color - composition
can also be from a residue of another protein
This experience shows the variety of protein values ​ ​ depending on the composition of the amino acid
Protein denaturation
The purpose of the experiment is to determine the cause of protein denaturation
Denaturation is the destruction of the natural properties of protein
Largely due to the elimination of the hydrate layer, which maintains the stability of the secondary and tertiary structure
Such denaturation is reduced if it changes the factor affecting it, but at high temperatures of heavy metal salts, concentrated alkali acids are not denatured
At the same time, the restoration of the structure of the championship is impossible due to a change in its structure
Concentrated nitric acid, test tube tripod chemical cups with solution of egg white copper sulphate ammonium sulfate
Preparation and creation of experience
20 ml of egg white are poured into three glasses for each
adding saturated ammonium sulfate solution to the beaker
Protein falls into the precipitate
Sediment dissolves with water
Protein returned to the precipitate
Several drops of copper sulfate solution are buried on cup 2
A sediment of blue protein is formed that does not dissolve in excess water
In this case, irreversible denaturation of the protein occurs
Into cup 3 is poured with nitric acid with concentration of 10 ml
Amorphous white precipitate is formed
Heating of protein solution in 10-15 ml tube
Before boiling the liquid, a precipitate occurs
The process of denaturation of proteins is irreversible
Questions: In what cases does irreversible denaturation occur? Why do heavy metal salts poison the body? What processes can a protein be associated with? Why does the acid burn when it enters the body?
Nutrition and health
Pokrovsky developed the "concept of balance nutrition" in other words - to read the need of people for food [34]
Ensuring that not only the energy supply required for a proper life is sufficient, but also a mandatory balance of factors required for metabolism processes
This is especially important for growing organisms
The diet, depending on the types of sexual activity and areas where children and adolescents live, should be on the right balance
The basic principles of the power mode are:
Frequency that is, regular meals during the day
Daily Power Frequency
A healthy person is invited to recognize three or four-phase nutrition: breakfast for lunch and a glass of kefir before bed
For each power supply, the correct power supply must be observed as much as possible
At each meal, a set of products should be thought out in terms of the supply of protein fats to the body in an acceptable ratio of coals, as well as vitamins and minerals
Physiologically sound daily dietary distribution
Eating in four periods is much more pleasant: eating before work (25-30% of the total calorie intake during the day) in the break between work light second breakfast (10-15% of the total calorie content) with a fertile lunch (35-40% of the calorie content) relatively light dinner (15-20% of the total calorie content) [5]
In summary, the content of this course will allow students to be competent in their health and not to treat various types of diseases in terms of their rational use.

During the years of independence of the country in many spheres of our society there have been significant changes, strategic directions and priorities of economic spiritual and intellectual development of Kazakhstan have been determined
This will certainly be closely related to the formation of the country
Steps to ensure the entry of the national education system into the world educational space require professional and pedagogical skills, which require the continuous development of pedagogical personnel in the country
Legislative framework is defined with preparation of programs and concepts of education development in the Republic of Kazakhstan within the framework of identification of the Kazakh educational space with the world educational process
The programme of the third (basic) level of advanced training of teachers of the Republic of Kazakhstan is recognized, which allows to implement modern goals and values ​ ​ in accordance with the requirements of the State program for the development of education in the Republic of Kazakhstan
The program will be implemented through continuous face-to-face training
Program modules: new ways of learning and learning; critical thinking training; evaluation for training and evaluation of training; the use of information and communication technologies in training; educating talented and gifted children; education and education according to the age characteristics of students; learning management and leadership [1]
A patriot of his country, capable in the future of educating students independently, from modern innovative innovative views
new information methodology consists in the preparation of a talented leader who is able to evaluate his and other work, who has a high creative ability to learn, as a specialist practice, who is able to do critically considered scientific work, who is proficient in ICT technologies
Understanding socially constructive learning Approaches to learning and learning are generally recognized
Children are active learners building their understanding according to their own research and social relationships
To this end, pedagogical approaches to learning and dialogue-based learning are used as a modern necessity.
Although there are new approaches in the seven modules, we consider dialogue learning as a new method of learning
In the process of teaching dialogue, we see that ideas are moving in a two-way direction, on the basis of which the student's learning process develops as an active cognitive process
To achieve the result of this training, co-authorship works together at the expense of an equal partner in obtaining knowledge [2-3]
Joint thinking is actively implemented as a result of dialogue
Learning How to Learn in the Future Will Learn to Take Responsibility for Your Learning So That He Can Learn On His Own
Learning through dialogue helps the student express his opinion, deepen knowledge in the field of happiness through discussion
When drawing up a lesson plan to assess how a student understands the main ideas, the teacher can introduce evaluation criteria
Opinions of the trainee participating in the dialogue are heard, if necessary, directions-guidelines of addition are introduced
Recommended to learners to work with resources
Each group creates a conversation by selecting one of the conversation types
Each team completed the tasks
The interest and participation of all participants demonstrates the effectiveness of dialogue training
In the online training, I considered the following forms of training: paired group individual and questionnaires
Hearing someone else's opinion when performing the task by the group separately complements the formation of the student also when discussing oral speeches and quoting.
Ability to synthesize information and ideas adopted for the development of critical thinking of students and be able to mentally study the validity and relative significance of these information
Make a choice about your training
It can also be understood as skeptical of other people's ideas
Scientists have identified specific signs of critical thinking
They emphasize that the rationality of thoughts in the search for a better explanation is to prevent constructivism in the formulation of the question, to realize the subjectivity of beliefs and assumptions, taking into account arguments and approaches that have an understanding of the significance of evidence and conclusions.
They open a wide path to the quality of student education
Evaluation and evaluation of training for learning - this is related to all new approaches in the learning process
Students should know the essence of their understanding if they are active in building their ideas in the lesson, because they are on the main ladder of progress in learning
It is important for the teacher to know what goal he wants to achieve for the child
Therefore, it is necessary to know the criteria for achieving the goal
Standard control of the degree of prediction and sorting qualification based on daily control of knowledge and skills, manifested in the form of feedback or a test exam, reflecting the successful possibility of determining the difficulty in training.
Evaluation of curriculum content and learning style
Multiplying and sharing assessment and analysis from a critical point of view of obtaining information through the use of information and communication technologies in lessons learned
access to knowledge and skills
Therefore, obtaining new information on the achievements of science will facilitate the understanding of scientific concepts and will become an important tool in the process of teaching teachers
The main aspects of this technology: the ability to analyze and analyze and create appropriate stocks of information, find their location
Critical thinking of students through digital means means social involvement in the study of social awareness
It is known that when working with gifted children, the following principles for identifying gifted children are first developed:
Carrying out an analysis of the child's actions as part of the relevant activities; The use of training methods to remove the psychological barriers of a child with developing influence; Assessing the child's talent not only at the specific level of his or her mental development, but also taking into account the possibility of his or her future development; Characteristic assessments of teachers and parents with benchmarking interviews on performance analysis; Comprehensive assessment of the child's behaviour and actions, allowing for broad coverage of the child's abilities, using different sources of information
Pedagogical and psychological requirements for a teacher working with a gifted student can be divided into the following stages: requirements for education and teacher skills [4]
Summing up, it is now important to develop the functional literacy of the student to conduct classes using seven modules
In particular, understanding socio-constructive learning is an active learner who creates their understanding in accordance with their own research and social relationships, when the ways of learning and learning are largely recognized
To this end, pedagogical approaches to learning and dialogue-based learning are used as a modern necessity.

Competence and chemical expertise
This article is devoted to the formation of chemical competencies of students
The most important element of chemical competencies is the ability to work with structurally difficult materials (graphic texts)
The formation of such competencies will be influenced by special tasks
Preparation for the recognition of ability, together with specific knowledge and qualifications in the abilities of competence in education
enters
The approach to competencies can be interpreted as spontaneous improvement of the ways of action of creative abilities to form literacy skills of culture
Therefore, we need prompt and flexible full and deep knowledge, which should be accurate
The development of these ideas will contribute to improving the quality of training of school graduates when introducing competent education
Therefore, this direction is promising and relevant
Keywords: chemical competence, competence, knowledge and skills of informative action
Critical Thinking Technology Teaching Technology Fishbone Chart Method Ishikawa Fish Bone Method Conclusions that a fish skull has lower walls of each fish rib, fish tails are problematic evidence
The need arising in accordance with modern requirements to change the methodological basis for improving the quality of education at the current stage
Because every day of school is full of profound social changes in many scientific discoveries
If earlier the teacher played a key role in the educational process, now the student is showing activity
The lesson is evaluated by the actions of the student, and not the teacher
How in the modern world it is important to teach, not teach [1-3]
The goal of the teacher is to provide such a tool that allows you to independently obtain this knowledge, and not to multiply the knowledge, and the individual development of the student, the formation of personality and the formation of innovative needs for improving the environment
Training in the development of new technologies in the educational process involves improving the quality of the educational process [1-4]
In this regard, today the main task of the teacher is to educate effective methods and approaches to new technologies, instilling them in the younger generation
Therefore, it is more profitable for each teacher for quality education to conduct new approaches and non-traditional types of classes from conducting lessons in a constantly established form.
In this direction there are new ideas of new technologies in which diversity of education in content options is based on science and experience [125-9]
During the classes, there are technologies used to increase interest in the subject, forming skills for searching and researching the student
One of them is Fishbone technology for developing critical thinking [1011]
Fishbow n - Fishbone Method "Honey Bone"
Ishikawa diagram - Fishbone Diagram or Cause and Effect Diagram
(Sometimes "Fishikawa" is also called "Balytskava")

Ishikawa diagram - methodology for explaining a known case or event for various reasons
It is most often used in Product design and provides for the deciphering of each cause causing the birbutin effect [Figure 1]
Figure 1 - Ishikawa diagram
Ishikawa diagram - a means of ensuring the systemic population, aimed at identifying the actual causes of the problem
The purpose of the method is to study and provide technologies for finding specific reasons for effectively solving the issue under consideration.
When conducting Fishbow n - Fishbone ball (knowledge mast) lessons, each group is given a separate discussion [Figure 2]
The circuit consists of four parts with upper and lower tail walls
Members of the group photograph the skeleton of fish:

Figure 2 - Fishbone - Fishbone fish backbone (knowledge mast)
The advantages of the physboine method Ability to determine the fundamental actions when describing the situation, the skills of public speech, analysis of information acquired by communication skills are formed, and it is possible to identify the shortcomings of theoretical knowledge
In order to increase the level of mastery of the material and increase the interest of students in the subject of biology, the biology lesson developed tasks using the Fishbone method; tasks used in biology lessons
This paper shows, as an example, the consideration of human skeletal sections using the fishbone method in biology lessons, the comparison of hand and limb bone differences used in the title "Gastric asthma fusion," Fishbone method cank and Fishbone method cank on the topic "Structure and value of muscles of its types" [Figure 3-6]
Tasks with a title for the Fishbone group are provided on page A4

Proofs
The Group undertakes group work on the task provided to them
Studying the departments of the human frame using the Fishbone method, students together answer the question of what a person needs blood for when filling fish blood
Figure 3 - Consideration of sections of the human frame using the fishbone method
By combining the difference of hand and limb bones with the use of the fishbone method, students can distinguish between hand and leg bones when filling the fish canola
Figure 4 - Difference between hand and foot bones using the fishbone method	to compare
According to the Fishbone method used in the topic "Digestion of the stomach," students will approve the new topic
What are abdominal diseases? Gives the final result with the reasons and evidence for the diseases
Figure 5 - Fischbone Method Kanka Used in Stomach Digestion Title
The level of material mastery by Fishbone students in the biology lesson has increased significantly
In biology lessons, Fishbone tasks were prepared; increased interest of students in biology by using tasks in biology lessons
At the end of the Fishbone lesson, the teacher asks the student a problematic question and teaches them to generalize basic thoughts, giving evidence of the possibility of solving the problematic question for the effective application of theoretical knowledge.
In carrying out this task, students also cooperate, making different opinions and opinions of each other

Laboratory works on the organization of the circle "Chemistry in everyday life" are interesting for discussing the content of the circle work
In the country's education system, much attention is paid to group and individual forms carried out outside classes, which are part of the system of additional education in a modern school
The circle is the only type of extracurricular work that occupies a wide place in school life
The writings of many scholars describe the importance of circle classes in the education and education of students in the methods of selecting materials for their conduct [1]
As you know, among extracurricular works aimed at the chemical education of students, the work of the circle occupies a special place
Because in the chemical education system, circle work performs special tasks [1-2]
These tasks are that in comparison with a lesson in extracurricular time, it is possible to study chemical qualifications; In order to improve the creative abilities of students, it is always necessary to take into account actions in accordance with their personal interests; in the study of theoretical materials of students
developing literacy skills capable of correctly assessing environmental chemistry issues; Enabling students' visual views and actions in accordance with their personal interests to improve their chemical knowledge; enabling students to use regional identification materials
Chemistry circles differ in content
Among them are a circle of design chemistry circles that create models of layout models that introduce students to interesting chemical practices and know how to make them publicly, an agrochemical circle "chemistry around us"
"chemical plant world" has such types as environmental local history chemists, "according to the chemical textbook" [2]
Members of the circle, according to the contents of the chemical circle, report on the contents and textbooks of the work at chemical evenings, which they presented at the circle meetings about the impressions of walks of a group of chemical industries in solving theoretical practical issues
A circle program should be created on the basis of an existing curriculum, but not repeat it
Members of the chemical circle record the results of a written report on the content of their work in special journals or diaries
Group joint work execution from personal execution sometimes turns out to be effective
The work of the members of the circle itself selects it for an effective output, the main thing is that it has the value to perform the work
Not the same goals of each circle, but nevertheless some features common to different chemical circles are taken into account
In this regard, when developing a circle work program, these features are taken into account
Mutual non-repetition of school and extracurricular circles
Creating programs of various circles or associations in such a way as to help students choose a profession as part of the curriculum
Holding meetings with the owners of the nearest specialties with the expansion of the content of circle work, thereby career guidance
In circle works, experimental and theoretical materials should be interconnected
Conducting cognitive learning walks
Help and teach students to independently choose the literature necessary for research work in planning circle work
The duration of each session when discussing theoretical materials should not exceed one hour, and the performance of expert or design work should not exceed 2-3 sessions
Circle works mainly consist of three sections: theoretical knowledge of qualification classes, final report on qualification work
Circle materials should be diverse, attractive to students [3]
All this develops the cognitive activity of students, increases interest in the subject and allows you to freely choose a profession
The table below shows the topics for the organization of the "Chemistry in Everyday" circle for high school students in chemistry [4]
The names of laboratory practices according to these topics are also given.

"Washing" calcium in egg shell
Use of medicines and their effects on the human body
Adsorption of paints and other substances in activated carbon
In laboratory practices in accordance with "Proteins" on the topic "Chemical composition of food products": protein denaturation and color reactions to proteins
Protein denaturation
The purpose of the experiment is to determine the cause of protein denaturation
Denaturation is the destruction of the natural properties of protein
This is largely due to the elimination of the hydrate layer, which retains the stability of the secondary and tertiary structure.
Such denaturation is reduced if it changes the factor affecting it, but concentrated alkali acids denature irreversibly at high temperatures of heavy metal salts
At the same time, the restoration of the structure of the championship is impossible due to a change in its structure
Color reactions of squirrels
For the qualitative determination of proteins, color reactions are used
a) Xanthoprotein reaction (Greek
xantha yellow) proteins containing benzene nucleus give yellow color with concentrated nitric acid
When exposed to My s (II) hydroxide proteins with an alkali solution, an open violet color occurs
This reaction determines peptide bonds in proteins
b) When lead is heated with the addition of acetate and alkali, a black precipitate of lead sulfide is formed in hydrogen sulfide proteins
Carbohydrates
Sugar definition
Sugar determination method (Bertrand permanganate cyanide method refractometric method)
Defines sugar to control the proper storage of sugar and starch-containing products
The Bertrand permanganate method is based on the oxidation of sugar by reagents, which include copper in the form of a dissolved complex compound
It is formed by mixing the same number of Feling solutions No. 1 (solution of copper sulfuric acid) and Feling No. 2 (alkaline solution of potassium-sodium distillery)
Determination of saturated fats and their properties
Dissolution of oils in various solvents
Determination of dairy fat content
This method determines fat and fat content from dairy products under the influence of concentrated sulfuric acid (H 2 S0 4) and isoamyl alcohol
Qualitative responses to vitamins
Definition of vitamin C
Ascorbic acid oxidizes hexacyano-III ferrate oxidizes potassium
Mineral substances
Define Slavery
Slavery is determined by the gravimetric method
Definition of food salt
According to the titrimetric method of determining the food salt (sodium chloride) (Argentometric titration method by More)
Determination of nitrates in lawns
1% sulfuric acid to various parts of plants is determined by burying from a solution of diphenylamine
Determination of ice cream quality
Starch is colored blue by mixing ice cream with potassium iodide solution in the presence of starch
Absence of peroxidase indicates pasteurized milk efficiency
Determination of contamination of food salt
When cleaning food salt, it is filtered into water and the obtained solution is evaporated
This purification method is based on the different solubility of the substances included in its composition.
Determination of Potability of Water
Organoleptic properties of water are determined by the organs of vision (photosensitivity) and smell (smell)
Unsatisfactory organoleptic properties reflect water contamination
Determination of the chemical composition of water: carbonate anions and hydrogen carbonate; determining the nitrate anion; determination of empty carbon dioxide in water; determination of total water capacity
Research into the effects of alcohol on protein
To study the effects of alcohol on protein, egg white is removed, which is determined by the influence of ethyl alcohol, the denatured structure of the protein changes completely under the influence of alcohol
Alcohol content in flowers and breeds	fruit	impact study
When poured into one glass of water, and in the other 20% solution of ethyl alcohol in each of them, after less than two days, two different changes are found in two cups
"Washing" calcium in egg shell
When laying eggshell shells in an aqueous solution and acidity of various types: coca-bronze acetic acid and food soda, its changes are observed
Despite the fact that students cannot try all these laboratory works, they will get acquainted with the working methods and discuss them with members of the circle [5-6]
In conclusion, the topics proposed by the Chemistry in Everyday High School Circle will help to study topical issues of chemical expertise and increase interest in chemistry and further improve the chemical education of students

The trend of the last decade to promote the most efficient and dynamic development of the world economy in the fields of recreation and tourism
And turn these industries into a source of profit in order to improve the welfare of the country
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Nazarbayev writes in his book "Strategy for the radical renewal of the global community and partnership of civilizations": "Today Kazakhstan has the opportunity to use its geographical natural advantages to develop and implement the Development Strategy so that its national interests and new imperative nature are identical to the relationship between economy and society
At the same time, a basis has been created for the development of full-scale tourism and recreational activities
In recent years Kazakhstan has paid great attention to the development of the sphere of recreation and tourism
New trends in the socio-economic development of the country, in turn, determine the tourist potential of each required region and the need for a preliminary assessment of the formation of recreational products
Reform in the field of tourism requires a flexible regional policy, taking into account the peculiarities of each region, large differences of regions in economic natural-geographical socio-demographic political and other conditions that require a special unified approach of Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan is one of the unique and ancient cities, Taraz city with a long history
At the same time, the number of priority areas of the social and economic policy of the city of Taraz in recent years has become a comprehensive development of the tourism and recreation sector
Under these conditions, a comprehensive assessment of the tourist potential of the city of Taraz arises, determining its regional characteristics and prospects for use

Development of miniature tourism in Kazakhstan
The artistic development of human history has inherited many different ethical procedures that testify to posterity after its existence, scientific achievements of religious culture and historical cultural monuments
Among the objects of religious tourism of Kazakhstan, the city of Turkestan occupies a special place
The development of Turkestan along the caravan road of the Great Silk Road has become a hotbed of science and culture, brought not only from foreign countries
This city is now the spiritual center of our country, with its attractiveness and historical value reminds of the oldest cities of Kazakhstan every step
In the XI-XII centuries.
In subsequent years, in addition to the name of Khoja Ahmed, "nisbu," Yasaui was named after the area where the alla was engaged in worship until the last period of its life
In past periods, Kypchaks, Aryns, Dulats and Turkish tribes lived in this zone, who contributed to the formation of Kazakh ethnogenesis
During this period, the famous cities of Sauran Syzanak Otrar Yasa Sairam Sozak entered the Turkestan region
In particular, this region played a big role in the formation of the Kazakh state

Tourism potential of the Republic of Kazakhstan, located in rural areas, is still fully studied and is not presented to the market
Currently, new types of tourism are emerging, consumer preferences are changing
On the one hand, this creates new opportunities, on the other, because the development of tourism that introduces a rural lifestyle is due to the need for time
Currently, agrotourism is developing well in Europe and the USA China Russia Belarus
There are small enterprises that offer agrotourism products to the market
Type of tourism of Zhailao in Kyrgyzstan
develops
A distinctive feature of the products is the hospitality of environmentally friendly products presented in collaboration with a national handicraft that demonstrates the special nature of the mountain region
Kazakhstan has special natural resources and the culture of nomadic peoples, and all regions of the republic are rich in natural cultural resources and at that time are one of the countries that have great opportunities for the development of tourism
Due to the fact that one of the main principles of tourism is the preservation of equality between people and the opportunity for them to travel by age regardless of gender and social situation, we can solve potential economic and environmental problems through the development of tourism in the country
In particular, providing the country with labor, increasing incomes of the population
The development of sustainable tourism is a modern requirement and topical issues of all countries developing the tourism sector
The principles of sustainable tourism development, in turn, will preserve the balance of the natural sphere
It provides for the harmonization of tourist activities with nature, preventing the violation of natural resources through competent management of tourism and environmental relations
Today, the experience of developed countries shows that the systematic sustainable development of this industry is the key to nature conservation
Considering the main issues of toxic development of agrotourism in the countries of Europe, the following concepts can be discussed [1]:
Availability of accommodation in rural areas
Provision of necessary accommodation services to tourists
Support for agro-farms at the level of the local management committee and the State
Rural	country	in the village	tourist	service	offering	sitting	business	offerings to the service market structure
Development of means of extension of agrotourism products
Application of this experience, since on the example of foreign countries associations are created and solve key issues of this industry
Establishment of a regulatory framework to support rural tourism and consideration of tax incentives
Provision of information financial and methodological assistance
The emergence of any type of tourism depends not only on the needs of the graduate of the offered products, but also on the present
The development of the tourism business does not require a lot of funds and requires a special desire
Buyer behavior is one of the forces usually caused by travel
Thus, the incentive system is formed as a set of different reasons that determine models of disciplinary behavior
A person has an interest in taking any action
Interest is a very powerful driving force, indeed, a system of self-esteem
To increase interest in agrotourism, it is necessary to develop along with other types of tourism
Having revealed the factors influencing the journey of contemporaries, it was found that their friendly approach to comfortable history and cultural places is a national cuisine-recovery
Agrotourism has a close connection with the type of ethnic tourism depending on location, if it is associated with ecotourism in the classification of applied resources
Ecological and agrotourism refers to recreational species
Related to the proposals of agrotourism:
Organization of rural tours for families and students
Day camp
Purchase of rural products
Overnight and breakfast in the countryside
We can say that the following four components play a decisive role in choosing the direction of travel: cognitive shopping comfort and, of course, price
Due to the change in the taste of beginners, it is now worth looking at the lifestyle in the relations of the local population
amazing manifestations of sunset - this is also a beautiful view of nature
Currently, one type of tourism is developing along with another
Rural settlements can represent elements of ethnotourism along with agrotourism or rural tourism
Agrotourism refers to a special type of tourism
To develop agrotourism, a guest living on the spot, that is, in an aul rural settlement, must be provided with a house
It will be registered and managed by local private enterprise
Scenic landscapes to tourist attractions, ponds, lakes, gorges of the mountain zone
Therefore, agrotourism ecotourism ethnotourism gastronomic tourism
Should develop at times with species
If tour operators creating a tourist product offer products with a definition of market demand, this will be one socio-economic type of business
Ethnotourism is a tour that introduces tourists to the culture and creativity of certain peoples
Someone comes again to their native places when a mighty man escaped from the village
Ethnotourism is an integral part of national folklore
It continues to be transmitted from generation to generation [2]
Ethnotourism has two types: the first is a visit to a special place where special life and culture are preserved, for example, acquaintance with the Bedouin lifestyle in Egypt, acquaintance with ethnic groups in northern India in Thailand, acquaintance with the Li family tradition in China and excursions
See the museum of life of the second kind
Archivological excavations stored in especially old cities can also be perceived as a natural disaster reflecting the special development of the nation
Examples of ethnotourism can be seen in neighboring Russia, and in Kazakhstan
Russian farmer Vladimir Brezhnev organized his own ethno-museum "Village of the 17-19 centuries"
Ethno-Museum is located in the small town of Ertil, 130 km from Voronezh
Travel presents natural products in a safe environment
Here are the necessary conditions for a wonderful and unforgettable holiday

Advertising Distribution and Customer Profile
His ethno-museum "Village in the 17-19 centuries," organized by Vladimir Brezhnev, simultaneously develops rural tourism and ethnotourism
It is also known that the range of products offered is a favorable competitive side of this farm.
The development of agrotourism in rural areas is not just spending time in the countryside, it is a comprehensive tourist structure, like other types of tourism, and a great influence on the settlement.
It includes small restaurants and t, departments that provide various information and advertising in places of leisure transport links of settlements
development of industries
However, any tourist who arrives in the village should feel at a visit
In the development of agrotourism, farms together with tourist firms organize festival fairs
This contributed to the widespread spread of agrotourism and the emergence of entertainment farms
This increased the number of witnesses to the boiling life of farms
However, it is necessary to take into account the problems hindering the development of tourism
In our broadband area remote settlements
The level of infrastructure and infrastructure development in the country does not meet local standards
Not all places of residence are provided with engineering transport and social infrastructure
Reduced quality of roads and tourist travel
In rural areas, you can attract both domestic and foreign tourists with a display of national cuisine
What tourist will he get acquainted with first of all with the national values ​ ​ of the country and the values ​ ​ of culture and history of the people
We know that tourists coming to Kazakhstan, first of all, want to taste national dishes from our national cuisine
Therefore, one of the main directions of tourism development in the country is agrotourism, which can show the national cuisine and hospitality of the Kazakh people as widely as possible
One type of agrotourism can be combined with gastronomic tourism
Therefore, one of the most important aspects of the development of tourist service in the republic is familiarization of tourists with the traditional nutrition features of the Kazakh people and the development of the level of services in this direction.
Another connection of rural tourism with ethnocultural and ecological tourism can be seen on the example of the village of Shabanbai bi
Shabanbai bi Center of the Shabanbai rural district of Aktogai district
Located on the Karatal River at the foot of Mount Aksoran (height 1565 m), 45 km southeast of the village of Aktogay, 350 km south of Karaganda [4]
In the village of Shabanbai-bi there are 7 guest houses for 4-6 people
Hiking on top of Kyzylaraya represents ecotourism products
There are archivological monuments of the Bronze Age
Baigur kokpar is held in the village
There is an opportunity to get acquainted with the Kazakh national dish and craft
To develop agrotourism, you need to choose a rural settlement located in the beautiful artistic nature of the country
Analysis of infrastructure and area should be remote from urban land
It is advisable to equip the premises of houses of rural residents as a hotel
Products provided to people tired of the city, so there should be no TV fax phone in the rooms
In addition to the services provided, the organization of cultural events on excursions to the historical sights of nearby villages
It would be nice to show your husband art on national grounds or walk around a settlement or have unique sights in history
These products are also in demand among schoolchildren, since parents can see the profession of parents in raising children only on such farms.
Participation in the life of a rural farm, that is, eating pets, watering a fruit and berry garden, etc.
services can be provided
For further work, you can distribute information through the online sites of advertising papers and tourist fairs
Farms of agrotourism are limited to serving a small number of customers, and this restriction is usually the main principle of this product.
This personal farm and farm can engage in tourism along with other own farms
In many ways, "geographical location, that is, climate landscape and clean ecology" plays an important role in the choice of goods and the first need of tourists
The infrastructure situation in rural areas also does not get out of the demand of tourists
Agrotourism has great prospects for development along with other types of tourism
Etnomurazhay
Ecological Tourism Image entertainment complex (casino) of Kapshagay city Tourist potential - competition of environmental tourism resources
Millions of people travel to cities to see centuries-old cultural and art monuments to see new places and feel the beauty of nature, enrich nature with the clean air of mountains or relax through the forest air
Today there is no country in the world that does not manage tourism at a certain level
At least 4 billion people annually spend their 5-6 days outside their place of residence
More than half of this number travel for the purpose of recreation more than 5-6% of international congresses in order to attend 10-15% of symposium participants - their relatives [1]
Ecological tourism is a journey to beautiful landscapes in natural areas that are not subject to human economic activity and are not polluted in order to give them wild plants and beasts cultural ethnographic characteristics of the area
However, it creates economic conditions for the protection of nature for local residents without violating the integrity of environmental systems
Ecological tourism of Kazakhstan, which has its own characteristics, provides great opportunities to create a competitive tourism industry
This is facilitated by:
the useful geopolitical situation of the region - the creation of the possibility of international tourist and commercial traffic through this territory;
democratic transformation of political stability and economic reforms;
diversity of natural landscapes in the organization of ecological tourism of the animal and plant world;
diversity of cultural and historical interruption resources;
availability of free labour resources
What is the difference between ordinary tourism and ecotourism?
Firstly, ecotourism - visiting places with a good natural environment
Reserves on such lands are national natural parks and
Protected natural areas include:
Secondly, ecotourism is the cleanest environmental user
Ecotourists' nature exploitation technology is such that they receive most of the useful resources through vision (vision of natural attractions in the landscape, control of the plant and animal world) through auditory hearing (plexing of leaves into a ravine of birds (smell of forests and meadows)) through smell (cooling of river water)
Thirdly, ecotourism is strict rules of procedure that strictly regulate tourist discipline in the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (there should be no odors of plants with a tourist translator, etc.
Republic of Kazakhstan)
Their implementation is a prerequisite for the successful development of environmental tourism
Fourth, ecotourism provides an opportunity to improve the way of life of local residents working as service personnel through the development of national arts that contribute to the revival of national traditions [1]
The most relevant areas of environmental tourism are:
cognitive;
scientific;
sports;
Environmental tourism resources are:
natural and climatic factors: the relief of water bodies of flora and fauna special and simple natural zones
historical and cultural monuments related to the environment of the material and spiritual culture of mankind in a certain zone
Currently, environmental tourism occupies a significant share among other types of world-class tourism (from 40 to 60%) [2]
To develop the potential of tourism in the future, Kazakhstan has two tourist products:
entrepreneurial tourism;
environmental tourism [6]
The following special principles based on environmental tourism are defined:
Making an active contribution to the preservation of natural and cultural heritage;
Involving and benefiting from community planning and development and ecotourism activities;
Awareness-raising among tourists on the natural and cultural value of their location;
direction to small tourist flows consisting of small-organised groups and self-travelling tourists [4]
The need to develop environmental tourism in the Republic of Kazakhstan is explained not only by the economic factor - the creation of new jobs and the development of local communities in remote regions, but also by the deliberate and systematic emphasis on the issues of health and leisure of the population by social order
According to experts of the World Tourism Organization, environmental tourism over the past ten years is the most popular and is an instrument for the sustainable development of any state
Indeed, tourism occupies a special place in the rapid development of the economy
Results of study of tourism potential showed that Kazakhstan has great opportunities for development of ecological tourism
It is based on unique natural conditions and landscapes in the center of Eurasia - many natural historical monuments
As evidence of this, in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in order to increase the image of the city of Kapshagay, 5 entertainment complexes (casinos) Esperanza Flamingo Altyn-Yabloko Zodiak were opened in 2009 in the framework of the Decree on the development of the entertainment business only on the coast of Lake Kapshagay and Burabay.
And now their number has increased 2 times - "Prince" "Princess" "Golden Palace"
и «Sun City»
In parallel, the construction of several more casinos
No one doubts that in the future it will be Kazakhstan Las Vegas
Tourist infrastructure of the Kapshagai reservoir coast is formed every year
Head of State H
With direct management of Nazarbayev on the Kapshagay coast, the cost is 10 billion tenge
It is planned to build a new international airport and a city of the future with a network of social facilities
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said after meeting with Chairman of Shun Tah Holdings Limited Stanley Ho in Hong Kong
"We are just on the right bank of Kapshagay for $10 billion
considered a project for the construction of a future city, which is a dollar
It will not be just an entertainment center
It will be a beautiful city attracting tourists from all over the world, "the president said at a briefing.
"The necessary conditions for rest and life will be created here
Sports complexes and schools will be built at the new international airport, "said N.
Nazarbayev
He noted that "in our opinion, Hong Kong and Macau are more like those who intend to invest in this project."
For his part, Stanley Ho said that Chinese entrepreneurs are actively monitoring the implementation of tourism development plans on the coast of Lake Kapshagai in Kazakhstan
"We admire the successes achieved by Kazakhstan and the potential of our country," he said [7]
Ecotourism in Kazakhstan is developing now, but then you can feel the positive effect
Kazakhstan can be compared with a tourist stone, because such excellent tourist opportunities that correspond to the world competition are looking forward to their moment
Scientists have found that it is necessary to spend $1 billion to turn our country into an advanced tourist route until 2020
As a result of studies of those who show great interest in Kazakhstan as a tourist destination, it was revealed that 142 million tourists are residents of Europe and Asia
The number of tourists who arrived in Kazakhstan for the purpose of tourism in 2008: 618,732 people - domestic tourism - 183,973 people, and the results of the first half of 2009 - 127,414 and 355,488 people
Development of inbound and domestic tourism is one of the main projects of the Government of Kazakhstan, because tourism and travel are one of the leading export sectors
Arriving guests will definitely introduce foreign currency, which will contribute to the economy of the country
According to the data of outbound tourism, compared to the subsequent years of 2013 year, the indicator increased by 58%, while the population amounted to 13225 thousand people
In general, the state of ecological tourism in Kazakhstan is stabilizing
According to the Statistics Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the income of national specially protected areas in the status of legal entities from the influx of tourist groups serving 4916 thousand tourists in 2010 amounted to 201 1 l 121 m tenge [3]
The reasons for the weak development of environmental tourism in Kazakhstan include:
The most important and complex issue of environmental tourism development and the conditions of the tourism services market due to the mismatch of the scale of potential demand with the conditions of the material and technical base
This raises the following question - the lack of specialists in this field of tourism;
inadequate legal and regulatory framework for environmental tourism;
Lack of a statistical report on the status and quantity of the environmental tourism facility;
As a result of the imperfect tax policy, it is subject to an additional cost of 20% without limiting the nature of the activities of the tourist company, which receives foreign tourists in tourism activities and conducts the sending of domestic tourists abroad;
lack of funds for the development of ecological tourism routes in most specially protected natural areas, lack of trained personnel serving and informing visitors;
low transport accessibility of highways and roads to ecological tourism facilities located far enough;
lack of international relations in the field of environmental tourism and international experience in organizing environmental tourism
Thus, the development of ecological tourism in Kazakhstan will be used for the successful development of the entire natural and economic complex in the republic, as well as for achieving the goal of the main socio-economic country - sustainable development of society and a healthy lifestyle
In Kazakhstan, the following main proposals for the development of ecotourism can be distinguished: 1
Issues of ecotourism development to state sectoral and regional strategies
Inclusion in PA programmes and plans and individual PA management plans
Including including in pilot projects issues of allocating funds and providing incentive measures for entities involved in the development of ecotourism (PA tour operators);
Definition of criteria for ecotourism, as well as the actions of protected areas and tour operators involved in the promotion and formation of ecotourism;
Development and implementation of a scheme for voluntary eco-certification of tour operators and tour products engaged in ecotourism activities;
Provision of information and methodological assistance for the development and provision of ecotourses in the market;
Identification of optimal ways to determine the negative impact of tourism on the natural and social environment;
Attraction and informatization of the local population through ecotourism based on local communities;
Training of employees of organizations providing tourism services on ecotourism issues;
Use of environmental tourism income for nature conservation;
Participation of local communities in the development of environmental tourism;
Information and educational aspects on environmental tourism for tourists;
Saving energy and alternative energy resources from environmentally friendly modes of transport in ecotourism are issues related to the safe disposal of waste
Around the world, environmental tourism has developed at some level
In some countries, ecotourism is not only a large tourism sector, but also an economic sector, it is an environmental tool in other countries
Tourism in our country has become recognizable
Biological and landscape species of Kazakhstan are very rich and of world importance
Therefore, in order to preserve these natural monuments, it is necessary to combine the efforts of associations of state public regional international non-governmental organizations to solve many problems [5]

DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING OF STUDENTS
The article provides for the development of the thinking of students with various educational forms
So, in the Nazarbayev Intellectual School (NZSH), one of the directions of developing critical thinking from the point of view of the preragativity of the entire pedagogical team is a textbook
In addition to the fact that the source of knowledge in the learning process is a teacher, students and teachers jointly conduct research using a sitting document
Teacher helps to think about novelties in search and selected finds about applying critical attitude to students
Opening and learning are dialogue pedagogy in which the relationship between children and teachers has developed
When discussing NZM in the class, the mediation object is actively used - a research object with a set of objects
If the teacher considers the rules of dialogue and creates a dialogue model, then students combine new and good thinking in order to give each other strength

It is necessary to understand the interests and characteristics of students who pay attention to their emotional and relationship
Markings or contextual conceptualization markings are critically proposed to consider grounds for unauthorized regulation of opinions aimed at the thinking process
Large teachers will be interested in natural thinking about their work with training and profession, but in this process they will be interested in fundamentally ensuring work with the system and the atmospheric community

The proposed article shows a simple method of using the molecular orbitals (MOA) method, which allows predicting the formation of homonuclear molecules and molecular ions of elements of the first and second periods in a communication system and magnetic properties without using mathematical computational methods
The above method provides the basic rules for the method of molecular orbitals of methods for constructing schematic versions of electronic formulas and energy diagrams of simple molecules and molecular ions
However, the disadvantages and advantages of the molecular obritals method in comparison with the valence bond method are blurred.
This technique can be widely used to discuss the topic "Chemical communication" in courses of general and inorganic chemistry taught in higher educational institutions
Sources: Valence Bond (VBA) Method Molecular Orbitals (MOA) Method
Currently, the molecular orbitals (GO) method is widely used in the description of a chemical bond.
In the course of the lesson, it is possible to increase the creative ability of students and students to expand their knowledge of chemistry by teaching them to independently perform reports and tasks using a different approach to the teaching of the structure of molecules to a clear understanding of the nature of the chemical bond.
This method is based on a different approach compared to the valence bond (VB) method.
If the VB method considers all atoms of molecules separately, the GO method is considered as one indivisible fraction
The valence bond method characterizes the ability of atoms to form a certain amount of covalent bond, explains the orientation of the covalent bond, gives a satisfactory description of the structure and properties of a large number of molecules
However, the WB method cannot explain the nature of the formed chemical bond or create an incorrect idea of ​ ​ the properties of the molecule
For example, the VB method determines the formation of hydrogen ion N 2 (bond energy 256
kJ/mol)
Because the composition of the N2 + ion includes only one electron according to the VB method
All covalent bonds are made at the expense of a common electronic pair, which means that the H2 + ion cannot be corrected
Disadvantages of VB method:
N2 + Ne2 + O2 + G2 + -CH2 molecular ions and some radicals cannot explain the formation of -NH2 -OH;
O2 paramagnetic properties of molecules containing some electron pairs, NO and t
cannot explain;
It is not allowed to change the bond energy when the electron is disconnected from the neutral molecule;
The electron cannot explain the formation of insufficient molecules of the idea of ​ ​ B2H6
To explain such facts, the method of molecular orbitals is used
According to the GO method, electrons in molecules spread to molecular orbitals are characterized by certain energy levels and shape, such as atomic orbitals
Unlike atomic habits, the molecular orbitals method includes not only one atomic, but also the entire molecule, that is, two or multi-core
Extending this method
Hund et al.
developed by researchers
The basic principles of the molecular orbitals method:
Molecular orbitals are formed as a linear combination when atoms approach from atomic orbitals to such distances that they can form a chemical bond with each other
The number of formed molecular orbitals is equal to the number of primary atomic orbitals
Only atomic orbitals with closer energy are masked
When two atomic orbitals with close energies evaporate, two molecular orbits are formed
The energy of one of them is called a binder, which is reduced compared to the energy of primary atomic orbitals, and the energy of the other will increase compared to the energy of primary atomic orbitals, relaxing it	speaks	calls
Chemical	communication	for correction	nonparticipation	molecular	called orbital without orbit connection
As a result of AO masking, an o-bond (chemical bond axis masking) and a p-bond (rotation on both sides of the chemical bond axis) can be formed
Bond strength is proportional to the degree of AO masking
The order of the molecular orbitals in terms of their energy growth is determined by experiment
When electrons fill molecular orbitals	The principle of minimum energy, as when filling AO, is observed the Pauli principle and the Hund rule
To describe the density of electrons responsible for the bound molecular formation of atoms
Number of contacts applied
If the amount of bond is greater than zero, then a molecule (or other molecular fraction) is formed, and at zero - is not formed
The magnetic properties of molecules (or molecular particles) are determined by the number of left electrons located on molecular orbitals
The electronic composition of molecular orbitals can be formulated according to the electronic formula
Physical meaning of the method
The transition of electrons from orbital to binding GO leads to the formation of a chemical bond and energy distribution
And the transition of electrons from an orbital to a releasing MO, on the contrary, requires energy consumption
Higher energy in orbit O 6 ҷ 1 С than in atomic orbits 1c, respectively
The ratio of this energy is shown in Figure 1a
Figure 1a also shows the molecular orbit of two hydrogen atoms O 6 ҷ 1 S and obos1s
When changing the binder, GO with electron-orbital emits as much energy as it takes to switch to the maternity hospital
Figure 1 - Energy diagram of GO formation:
a - formation of hydrogen molecules under the action of orbitals of two identical atoms
Electron atoms of atomic orbitals characterized by less energy are in a stable state (without excitation)
In the same GO method, molecules obtain a stable state when low-energy electrons are in molecular orbitals
Therefore, when forming a hydrogen molecule, both electrons switch from orbit to the enrichment molecular (Figure 1b)
The spin of electrons of one GO should be located opposite the Pauli principle
PG type and PG ornament
When masking two 25-AO, two MOs occur - binding obile and relaxing o (Figure 2)

According to the lg-type (Figure 4), equal energy of steam is formed during leaching of AO and/} -AO

increases when switching to a combination of AO with high main quantum numbers in the layer (Figure 5)
Figure 5 - Diagram of energy levels of AO and GO elements with two molecular homonuclear elements of the second period (b) from IC (a) and N2 to G}
However, the ratio of the energy levels ox - and p- MO can vary as a result of the interaction of GO electrons and in one period
For example, an increase in the GO energy of two atomic molecules located at the beginning of the first period and (Ch2dein) of the second period can be placed in the following row:
The change in the energy of the GO of two atomic molecules located at the end of the second period is placed in another row:
Number of contacts
In the PG method, instead of the concept of multiplicity of communication, the concept of the number of connections is used
The bond is equal to half the difference of electrons binding and relaxing:
If binding and relaxing electrons are equal, BS = 0 and the molecule are not formed
Bond energy increases with the increase in the amount of bond n in the same type of molecules
Unlike the VB method, the chemical bond in the GO method can be corrected only if there is one electron, and accordingly the number of contacts can be not only an integer, but also a fractional number: BS = 1/2 1/3
Magnetic properties
The nature of the transformation of electrons into GO allows you to determine the magnetic properties of molecular particles
Particles with unpaired electron have parmagnetic properties (attracted to the external magnetic field)
Molecules with a paired electron have diamagnetic properties (displaced from the magnetic field)
Paramagnity
Electron configuration of molecules
The formation of a chemical bond can be expressed by the electronic configuration of atoms and molecules
Writes the electronic configuration of molecules through the PG value
For example, the formation of a chemical bond in a lithium molecule of two atoms can be expressed by the electron configuration of the atom and the lithium molecule:
Energy O 6 ҷ 1 C and a/s complements each other with so-called internal HGs that do not participate in the formation of a chemical bond and do not bind
Therefore, may not be abbreviated or indicated conditionally, for example, K
Accordingly, the abbreviated electron configuration of the molecule will be as follows: L} PQ (O 6) 2] Molecule Na - # [K (obail 3c) 2] Molecule N2 [K (obail 2c) 2 (obos 2c) 2 (l2p) 2 (obail 2p) 2]
First period molecules and molecular ions of diatomic homonuclear
In the elements of the first period, 1} - orbital is considered as a valence orbital
Two atomic orbitals form two sg-MO - binding and relaxing
The formation of a chemical bond in a hydrogen molecule can be expressed through the following electronic configuration:
The energy diagram of the hydrogen molecule is shown in Figure 1b
BS = (2-0 )/2 = 1 - diamagnetic
When a hydrogen atom reacts with a positively charged ion, a molecular ion H2 + is formed (Figure 6):
BS = (1-0 )/2 = 05 - paramagnetic
Figure 6 - Energy diagram of molecular ion H + Figure 7 - H - energy diagram of molecular ion
In the H2 molecule, the bond length was lower than in the N2 + ion of excess BS (Table 1)
The GO method suggests the possibility of formation of a molecular ion of negatively charged H2- (Figure 7):
BS = (2-1 )/2 = 05 - paramagnetic
Its energy and bond length must be the subject of the H2 + ion.
The electronic configuration of the helium molecule can be formulated as follows (Figure 8):
BS = (2-2 )/2 = 0 - no molecule formed
Figure 8 - Energy of molecule No. 2
Figure 9 - Energy diagram of molecular ion Ne2 +
When the helium atom and the positively charged ion interact, a molecular ion Ne2 + is formed (Figure 9):
BS = (2-1 )/2 = 05 - paramagnetic
Table 1 - Electronic configurations of ecogomonuclear parts of elements of the first period and experience information
Molecules and molecular ions of the second period with two atomic homonuclei
The B2 molecule can be formed according to the GO method and proved in practice (Table 2)
As a result of the interaction of boron atoms, the B2 molecule is formed
Its bond length 0159 nm and dissociation energy (bond energy) indicate the presence of 288 kJ/mol molecules.
At the same time, the equality of 1 number of bonds is another proof of the formation of a molecule
According to Table 2, the molecule C2 can be formed, and the molecule No. 2 cannot be formed
Because the number of contacts is 0
The O2 electron configuration of oxygen according to the GO method consists of two pairs of electrons, that is, oxygen must be paramagnetic (proven in practice)
Predicting the paramagnetic properties of oxygen is considered one of the important achievements of the GO method
Paramagnetic properties shall have dibor
According to Table 2, the molecular ions N2 O2 O2- F2 can be formed higher than the corresponding bond energy molecules F2 and F2 (02 F2).
Particles with a nonlinear electron are called O2 - superoxide ion radicals are anion radicals

Comparison of VB and GO methods:
Using both methods, it is possible to explain the uniform distribution of electron density in compounds
As electron density between AO masking nuclei increases, chemical bond formation conditions increase bond strength
Or- and 8-contact connections are formed by AA type
Although the wave functions in the two methods are created differently, they initially use the same substance - mirror electron atomic orbits
In both methods, hybridization of orbitals is provided, but in various forms the VB method is the initial necessary period of their calculation, and in the GO method it is only a convenient way
However, as mentioned above, the GO method can explain the nature of the chemical bond in more versatile and complex compounds.
For example, the formation of an N2 + ion having no VB value characterizes the paramagnetic properties of oxygen and t
its advantage is that it can explain the facts
Calculate connection and link parameters using this method
things happen
Compare the results of two atomic homonuclear molecules in two methods (number of contacts)
Table 3 shows that the PG method is more convenient and coincides with the data obtained in practice
Table 3 - Contact numbers of some homonuclear molecules by VB and GO methods and their comparison with experience
Experimentally obtained bond numbers are based on dissociation energy: simple bond energy 100-300 two-fold 400-800 and three-fold bond over 800 kJ/mol
Thus, it is possible to master the basis of the methodology for applying GO theory using the basic principles of the molecular orbitals method, which assume the possibility of forming homonuclear molecules of elements of the first and second periods (by constructing energy diagrams)

The goal of the general secondary education system is to create a physical person who will live in a future society taking into account the age characteristics of students
For this, secondary school will not be allocated free of charge for three levels
First stage - elementary school
Here young people study from 7 to 10 years old
Since a teenager under 7 years old is a "playing boy," and from the age of 7 he begins to form a language of memory, interest in everything
To realize this goal, on the instructions and proposals of the Head of State, Nazarbayev's youth are taught intellectual schools of public and humanitarian natural and mathematical schools
We believe that a differentiated approach to learning (differentiation) can be used in trilingual education
At the same time, the current education system has undergone three changes.
Special classes with a foreign language of instruction will be opened in secondary schools
In case of opening English-language educational classes, such as modern Kazakh Russian classes, those wishing to study in this language will be able to study in all subjects in a language they understand
Further learning process

MOLECULAR ORBITAL METHOD
The possibility of using modular technology in this article - in the study of effective pedagogical tools, the main topics of which are students of the 1st year of general chemistry
"Chemical bonding"
molecular orbital method (MOA) "- for a very complex understanding and deep
to seize
The modular technology chosen by us is logically interconnected with 6 training elements (REP), in accordance with which lectures are allocated to the module
The sequence of presentation of the tasks of each EP with the assessment of the degree of material, starting with the development of knowledge, the repetition of the material, the main purpose of which is incoming control (EB-0), the previous topic: "Chemical communication
Covalent Bond
Valence Bond Method (REP) "
New material with logical sequence is recorded in EB (1-5):
Method of understanding completeness and memorization of theoretical and applied bases defined in each EB
The lecture - rest control (EB-6) - mastering of new knowledge of the degree of assessment is completed
As shown, this will make it possible to increase its individual-motivational activity on the topic at lecture and seminar sessions based on modular technology due to increasing the depth of information capacity of the given material
At the same time, the possession of simple and deep material to ensure that this methodology is sufficiently understood, control the current and intermediate level of knowledge with the proven results of its effectiveness
Methodological features of personal-oriented pedagogical technology of modular education technology

The article proposes to create a chemistry program, studied in medical colleges, in accordance with the requirements of credit training technologies, since all universities of our state work on credit training technology in accordance with the requirements of the world education system with bringing the training system in line with educational standards of developed countries of the world
In accordance with modern requirements in the future, professional and technical educational institutions can also switch to training under this training system
"Content of general and inorganic chemicals and division into modules that meet the requirements of the technology of credit education, which are a compulsory educational subject in medical colleges"
In accordance with the content of each lecture, topics of workshops and laboratory work are presented
They also demonstrated the work that students need to do on their own in accordance with the topics

In this article, the peculiarities and methodological foundations of the course of inorganic chemistry at the university with the use of local materials are considered. The purpose of the topic of inorganic chemistry at a modern university is primarily to determine ways to deepen the knowledge of students in teaching using local materials.
The use of local materials in inorganic chemistry courses requires the use of effective methods for determining the topic and place of classes
Lecture at the university is the main basis of the didactic cycle of study
Its goal is to form the reception of educational material by students
Lectures are very relevant for modern universities
The successful or unsuccessful passing of lectures in front of the audience is due to a large number of factors: the level of teacher's qualifications, the level of training, the student's interest, the correctness of classes, the effective use of technical means in classes, etc.
Its level helps to conduct classes in different forms.
It follows from them that a lecture using local materials on inorganic chemistry is distinguished by its content logic and accuracy and informativity.
Combination of local materials (combination) lectures explanation of emotional qualification level - indicative heuristic study

The relevance of the study is determined by the needs of scientific and literate specialists who are able to process information that meets the requirements of modern society, not only in Kazakh and Russian, but also in English.
During the experiment, bilingual classes were held in Kazakh and English
The article indicates the method of teaching the bilingual method of the topic "Obtaining sulfuric acid by contact under ondristic conditions"
To teach undergraduates in English, the following methods were used: translation of texts by terms and the phrase and solution of crosswords to activate the method of teaching undergraduates, audiovisual and communicative methods
In the course of teaching a chemical subject in English, an increase in the linguistic and professional maturity of students was demonstrated
Translation of terms into the chemical subject of English bilingual teaching audiovisual method

CLUSTERS OF ESSENTIAL INORGANIC COMPOUNDS: BASE OXIDES
Article: "Basic classes of inorganic compounds" is the basic course of inorganic chemistry in basic school
When performing tasks in chemistry at UNT, it is necessary to know this topic for further successful study of chemical disciplines in higher educational institutions
But recently, graduates have shown very weak knowledge on this topic
One of the main reasons is that at an early age of the 8th grade, acid acids based on oxides were provided briefly.
Therefore, it was necessary to consider it in detail
This article presents the tasks of determining students' knowledge of the chemical properties of inorganic substances
In our opinion, the proposed tasks contribute to the development of thinking, as well as increase the effectiveness of subject training
Keywords: periodic law, oxide bases, acid properties

DIDACTIC PRINCIPLES FOR TEXTBOOKS AND TEXTBOOKS
This article considers the current issue of the content of requirements for modern textbooks and educational and methodological complexes for achieving high results
Each principle, when choosing the principles of which it is necessary to take into account the direction of the textbook, performs certain functions
The content and quality of the textbook affect the educational work
Innovative pedagogical technologies and methods mastered by Kazakhstani teachers
Based on their past experience and new general agological didactic methodological directions, it is possible to create the basis of a new educational paradigm and create a new range of textbooks for building a modern educational process
Requirements for any textbooks and educational and methodological complexes are determined by the requirements of modern society for educational requirements for teaching methods in the theory of education of the achievements of science, as well as for the theory of textbooks
Modern didactic principles take into account the requirements for planning and analyzing the results achieved for all components of the educational process - logic, choosing forms and methods for building content for purposes and calculations

ha) is the internal continental position of the country, determining the land and aridity of the climate, leading to widespread, poverty and even distribution of water resources
Conditions for the development of land absorption processes are created when seasonal features of soil formation are disturbed by drought
Also a prerequisite for desertification is the weak accumulation of land cover and its dynamics
This is Kazakhstan
natural features are known for the poor resistance of the natural environment to anthropogenic impacts (according to available data, about 75% of the country is exposed to a high threat of environmental destabilization)
Under the influence of anthropogenic factors leading to desertification from drought, the animal world of the republic has undergone some changes
The fauna of spider birds of surface and soil insects was very badly affected. mammals and other animals
About 80% of the territory of the regional steppe fauna in the northern regions of the republic was liquidated
A similar situation has developed in the Tian Shan field belt and its foothills, where many species of insect phytophages have disappeared - predators of wild bees pollinating plants, and parasitic joints of small birds, predators and mammals

One of the common negative factors of psychoemotional disorder is the common negative factor, which leads to disruption of the entire body.
Conditions will arise for the development of neuropathological syndromes in conditions of emotional stress, which forms the pathological focus of arousal
With a deep understanding of the endocrine system and the immune system, you can not only find methods and ways to correct changes caused by exposure to psychoemotional shock, but also prevent disruptions in its activities in mama and lactoposis in the body system
This paper presents experimental data on the influence of emotional factors on the structural and functional states of biological membranes (uterine experiences during the period of mammo and lactopoiesis)
A prerequisite for cell activity is to maintain a normal level of empty radical oxidation
Membranes are a structure in which processes of adaptation to adverse environmental conditions, as well as processes leading to further damage to the cell, are primarily carried out

In modern social conditions, a bilateral stress effect is mainly observed: firstly, it is a necessary protective and adaptive reaction to life, and secondly, stress causes social and economic damage to humanity, causing pain and pain.
Stress is a biological protective response
It is psychoemotional in gravity to limiting the movement of patients to the temperature of microbes and t.
develops in response to environmental impacts
It leads to functional-structural damage to the membranes of many organs, including breast parenchyma and red blood cells under the influence of various stressors
In the process of life development, a stressful reaction formed as obesity of the beneficial and protective force of the body, in some cases, can become a negative effect, causing irreparable harm to the body.
Stress in such cases poses a danger to physical and mental health
Intensive scientific and technological progress has created conditions that contribute to the growth of psychosomatic pathology in a significant amount along with more favorable aspects of increasing emotional pressure, in which the needs for changing the life of mass resettlement in the city increase
Clinical and experimental data show that free radicals play an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions [1]
Reduction of LAT power and activity at depletion of antioxidant system reserve in case of chronic and severe negative effect completely change channels of receptors and ion conductors of lipid proteins in membrane [2]
Free radical reactions occurring in the cell membrane reduce the activity of cell enzymes and activate lipid oxidative processes and lead to damage of cells of the general organism and tissue membranes [3]
Antioxidant insufficiency condition as nonspecific pathophysiological response
contributes to the development of various diseases
Weakening and rupture of antioxidant systems largely determine intensity of pathological processes formation [4]
The discovery of the mechanism of stress and its adaptation is not a single way to find the basis for a comprehensive study of stress in normalizing the service system when applying the method and action of the body to increase resistance
Various stressors result in structural-service damage to cell membranes and organ tissues, including breast parenchyma
Currently, one of the common negative factors of psychoemotional stress is the common negative factor, which leads to disruption of the whole body.
In conditions of emotional stress forming pathological focus of arousal, conditions for development of neuropathological syndromes arise [5]
With a deep understanding of the endocrine system and the immune system, it is possible not only to find methods and ways to correct changes caused by exposure to psychoemotional stress, but also to prevent disturbances in its activity in mama and lactoposis in the body system [6-8]
In this regard, the aim of the study is to identify the effect of emotional stress on the antioxidant system and the resistance of rat breast secretory cell membranes in various stages of reproduction
Research materials and methods
Research was carried out in the lactation laboratory of the Department of Biology of the Institute of Natural Science and Geography of KazUPU named after Abay and the Institute of Human and Animal Physiology
In order to achieve the set goals and objectives, physiological properties and the state of the antioxidant system of secretory cell membranes of mammary glands of laboratory females with a weight of 180-250 g in vivo have been studied in practice.
For rats, 2 types of emotional stress were applied:

Research results and discussion
Blood plasma vitamin E content in normal condition and stress exposure of rats
Tocopherol participates in oxidation-oxidation reactions in tissues
Vitamin E is an antiradical and antioxidant biologically active compound that inhibits lipid peroxide in simple model systems
Membrane
As is known, the "state of tocopherol" is controlled by the pro- and antioxidant balance of ascorbic acid
As is known, the addition of vitamin E to the diet reduces the stress of oxidation of free radicals, such as "trap" [9]
Our studies have determined the amount of vitamin E in the plasma of parasiform and milk-like blood (Figure 1)
Abciss number: a group of animals; Amount of vitamin E μg/ml; - p ≤ 005 Suret-1
Emotional stressful effects on plasma vitamin E in paz rats
It is very active in reducing the oxidation of low-density cholesterol lipoproteins than vitamin C
Interacts in the cell membrane based on vitamin E, soluble in oil, due to the lipid medium
With vitamin E in the control group, 131 μg/ml, its amount under emotional stress decreases to 122 μg/ml
With emotional stress, the amount of vitamin E in the blood plasma of chicks is reduced compared to normal animals
Vitamin E reduced to 119 μg/ml with emotional stress on the amount of milk-containing animals in blood plasma (control - 131)
The same studies showed that mammals did not show the endogenous properties of vitamin E in blood plasma in the body under emotional stress (Figure 2)
Abciss number: a group of animals; Amount of vitamin E μg/ml; - p ≤ 005

stress effect
Here, vitamin E deficiency in the body during beech and lactation of animals and additional emotional stress to it increases, that is, the resistance of the antioxidant protective situation in the body is violated when the mother's children are separated through a clear barrier
The dose of vitamin C in the blood of rats when exposed to emotional stress or ascorbic acid and vitamins E and K are also antioxidants soluble in natural water, have a dominant place in the intracellular antioxidant system and are very closely related to tocopherol.
With the high role of vitamin C in the antioxidant system, we studied the endogenous vitamin content in psychoemotional stress (Figure 3-4)
Abciss number: a group of animals; Amount of vitamin C mg/ml; - p ≤ 005
Suret-3
Vitamin C content in the blood of puffins with emotional stress
Ascorbic acid is synthesized in the body of all animals, with the exception of primate and human guinea pigs
In rats, vitamin C is synthesized from glucose in the liver using the enzyme L-gulono-oxidase [10]
Abciss number: a group of animals; Amount of vitamin C mg/ml; - p ≤ 005
Suret-4
Vitamin C content in the blood of nursing twins under emotional stress
As seen in the images, psychoemotional stress had a significant impact on vitamin C content
With a dose of vitamin C pigs in the control group 0068 mg/ml, and when exposed to psychoemotional stress - up to 0023 mg/ml
Control is associated with the intensity of synthetic processes during lactogenesis, when vitamin C levels decrease with the appearance of lactation in rats
Therefore, biologically active substances should be used for sufficient vitamin C content under stress
Thus, with emotional stress, the amount of vitamin C in milk-containing animals decreased to 0032 mg/ml compared to the control group
Thus, emotional stress led to a decrease in the content of vitamins in the blood, having a negative impact on the antioxidant system of the body of spiders and milk-forming animals
Discussion of results
This paper presents experimental data on the influence of emotional factors on the structural and functional states of biological membranes (stress on the uterus during the period of mammo and lactopoiesis)
Stress is a biological protective response
It is psychoemotional in gravity to limit movement to microbes at temperature and t.
develops in response to environmental impacts
It leads to functional-structural damage to the membranes of many organs, including breast parenchyma and red blood cells under the influence of various stressors
Clinical and experimental evidence shows that free radicals play an important role in many physiological and pathological settings
With psychoemocial stress, the sympathetic-adrenal system is activated, which negatively affects the processes of mammo and lactogenesis and leads to the further emergence of hypogalactia with a decrease in milk release [11-15]
The results of the study on the effect of emotional stress showed that both models of stress impact lead to a significant change in the stamina properties of biological membranes in both mammals and mammals
Thus, the aggression and emotional stress of rats caused a real decrease in membrane resistance of the studied breast
Disconnecting children from mothers with a transparent barrier was a strong stress for nursing mothers
It's dairy iron
confirms a decrease in the level of high LAT products in microsomes and superoxide dismutase activity
With stress action, there was a decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase of vitamins E and C
The reason for the work is also vitamins E and C, which have an antioxidant effect from excessive consumption of active oxygen products during oxidation stress
At the same time, increasing the intensity of LAT processes disrupts the functions of restoring antioxidant activity
The antioxidant membranoprotective role of tocopherol, forming a system of natural inhibitors within living organisms, is considered somewhat justified
When vitamin E is added to the body together with ascarbic acid, the antioxidant effect is higher, which can block free radicals, stopping oxidative reactions
Conclusion
Emotional shock causes oxidation stress with increased lipid oxidation products in rat breast microsomes at different periods of reproduction
With emotional shock, activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase in breast membranes decreased
Emotional shock reduced the content of vitamins E and C in the blood of spiders and feeding animals
Due to emotional shock, the body's stability during the stages of pregnancy and lactation decreased, which in turn leads to a deterioration in the health of future generations

Maintaining the diversity of racial reserves of natural flora is one of the most pressing issues of today
To solve these issues, the question arises of studying the vegetation cover and flora of certain regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Although the flora of the Ili Alatau has been sufficiently studied, monitoring the flora of the vegetation cover of areas dominated by anthropogenic effects is one of the most important issues
Insufficient scientific information about the vegetation cover and flora of the Small Almaty Gorge
In the Small Almaty Gorge, due to the content of its flora in the vegetation cover close to the city, people often visit and threaten the disappearance of some plant species or their reduction due to the use of other useful plants, especially medicinal ones
In the gorge there are endemic and rare plant species of special scientific importance
Therefore, the analysis of the flora of the studied region is of great importance for the identification and identification of rare and endemic plants under threat of reduction, and their identification (range).
The small Almaty gorge in connection with the location of a large metropolis in Kazakhstan near the city of Almaty has a great influence on the vegetation cover of the gorge, although its flora is relatively biologically multifaceted

One of the historical concepts - the concept of historical fact - begins tomorrow
Later, in connection with the development of archaeological science, historical data were divided into two groups: written and natural - archaeological
If scientifically we consider the words "archaeological site" "archaeological fact," then they have the same meaning
An archaeological site is a complete archaeological source if it is an object of scientific research that has passed a full scientific examination
Thanks to the knowledge of ancient historical and cultural sites by archaeological work, the scale of local history is expanding
Consider historical local history and define the main cultural centers of the region
Historical and cultural situation helps to learn the past of the country and deepens the level of development by continuing this direction

Mountain tourism is primarily an unforgettable trip to the mountains - it is a special holiday
Kazakhstan has very great tourism and recreational potential and has great opportunities for tourism development
The level of psychological training in tourism activities is often decisive
Psychological training of the tourist is a safety factor, so it should be identical to physical and technical training
Without a clear understanding of all the psychological complexity of tourism activities, it is impossible to create a rational method that meets modern scientific and pedagogical requirements without a variety of relations defining it
Psychological personality features arise in conditions of stress of negative environmental factors, the behavior of which changes with strong mental processes and physical stresses, which is noticeably manifested in tourism
The upbringing of the tourist ensures the correctness and determination of interests, as well as commitment to his worldview needs, the formation of activity and other qualities of self-confidence

The results of a study of the nutritional status of students showed that irrational and "walking" fast food often consume a large number of food products and carbonated sugary drinks, consuming insufficient vegetables and fruits and other negative factors for health
Only 50% of students eat according to eating time, and 450% do not always observe eating time, 500% often do not observe eating time
It turned out that 63% of students use fast food on average in 35% of cases, that almost 2% of students do not use them at all
As it became known, the existing deficiencies in the nutrition of students are associated with the misuse of food products that are not available due to food deficiency
At the same time, the lack of awareness of the vast majority of students about healthy nutrition leads to alimentary disorders
The vast majority of people are not aware of the importance of healthy eating in preventing the prevalence of diseases that are completely unhealthy to the principles of healthy eating
The results of the study will serve as the basis for the preparation and implementation of activities aimed at improving nutrition and raising awareness among student youth studying at higher educational institutions about the principles of healthy nutrition

It is very important to observe changes in the state of the environment caused by anthropogenic impacts in recent years
The system of observations and forecasts is the subject of environmental monitoring
The most effective method of environmental control for investigating these changes is bioindication, that is, assessing the state of the environment by the reaction of living organisms
Bioindicators whose microorganisms respond most rapidly to environmental changes
Their development and activities are directly related to the content of organic and inorganic substances in the environment, since microorganisms are able to destroy compounds of natural and anthropogenic origin.
Thus, it can be concluded that microorganisms are very mobile as bioindicators of the natural environment
The use of the bioindicator will allow to obtain primary information on the state of the environment

Real knowledge of a single substance can be obtained by establishing the relationship between the search for intersection points of different sciences and the determination of the initial causes of the phenomenon
Therefore, the emergence of new interdisciplinary sciences at the junction of several traditional natural sciences is not accidental
Of these: physical chemistry biological chemistry physical-chemical biology biophysics psychophysics and t
Of paramount importance in the formation of such specialists is the ability to see the object of the development of systemic thinking in units of its multilateral ties
Creating conditions at the disposal of teachers that contribute to the formation of systemic holistic scientific knowledge and practical skills that contribute to the synthesis of information received in various subjects
Thus, to date, in the process of teaching natural science disciplines based on interdisciplinary connections, issues of intellectual development of the student are relevant
The knowledge and knowledge gained by students in different subjects is a mixture of weak enriched data, not used in studies or in industrial practice

At the same time, the urbanization process involving many countries of the world in recent years should not be reminiscent of the spread of urban lifestyles in cities and their populations.
Large cities and urban agglomerations are also the "focus" of the surrounding territory by consolidating a larger part of the economic potential of a country or region
Therefore, the geography of schools pays great attention to the education of cities
But "the city is not only an economic center where spiritual values ​ ​ arise and industry is concentrated"
It is, above all, a special territorial association of people living in the city "
Therefore, the education of cities should be considered mainly through the study of its population through the growth of cities - through the rhythm of population growth through the features of the natural and mechanical movement of the population, and the territorial location of the economy - through the structure and location of the population

Synthesized palladium catalyst plated in zinc oxide with polymer-modified
Polyacrylamide (PAA) and polyacrylic acid (PAK) were used as the modifying polymer.
For comparison of properties, an analog catalyst system is also developed Pd/ZnO without modifier polymers
The resulting catalysts were tested by hydrogenation of phenylacetylene in an optimal manner.
The process went at a high speed (Wmax = 27-43 × 10-6 mol/s) and selectively styrene (90-94%) in the presence of all catalysts
It is noted that the ficking with the polymer contributes to an increase in the hydrogenation rate of the two-fold bond relative to the three-fold C-C bond.
In this system, the hydrogenation rate associated with three times C≡C was × times higher (40 13 10-6 mol/s) than that of the modified analog catalyst Pd/ZNO (32 × 10-6 mol/s)

Special attention is paid to the scientific study of various aspects of protecting and strengthening the health of students in the modern educational environment of the school
Analysis of many research studies carried out in recent years on the health of schoolchildren and adolescents in education
the proportion of healthy children deteriorates
As a reason, scientists and specialists call the creation of favorable conditions for students in educational institutions, as well as the fact that teachers do not pay special attention to the health of schoolchildren
There are also contradictions between the demand for a social environment in raising a healthy generation and the lack of a health system in a secondary school
To eliminate this contradiction, it is necessary to change the way of solving the problem: to explore modern technologies for protecting the health of students in Nazarbayev Intellectual schools of the leader of the country's secondary education system and to introduce best practices in the educational process of general education schools
Nazarbayev Intellectual schools are modern technologies of excellence.

Maintaining the diversity of racial reserves of natural flora is one of the most pressing issues of today
To solve these issues, the question arises of studying the vegetation and flora of certain regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Monitoring of vegetation flora, where anthropogenic effects and flora of the Ili Alatau prevail, is one of the most important issues
Insufficient scientific information about the vegetation cover and flora of the Small Almaty Gorge
In the Small Almaty Gorge, due to the content of its flora in the vegetation cover close to the city, people often visit and threaten the disappearance of some plant species or their reduction due to the use of other useful plants, especially medicinal ones
In the gorge there are endemic and rare plant species of special scientific importance
Therefore, the analysis of the flora of the studied region is of great importance for the identification and identification of rare and endemic plants under threat of reduction, and their identification (range).
The small Almaty gorge in connection with the location of a large metropolis in Kazakhstan near the city of Almaty has a great influence on the vegetation cover of the gorge, although its flora is relatively biologically multifaceted
Scientific institutions and special botanical research, as is known from scientific literature
The ratio of the main system groups of flora of the Small Almaty Gorge is indicated below
Flowering plant seeds account for 470 species or 977% of the total plant flora
The class of double claims of plants of closed breeds accounts for 379 species or 789% of the classes of individual contributions 91 species or 189% - 3 species or 0
6% cabbage includes 1 type or 02%
On the territory of the Small Almaty Gorge, all the main breeds of the Ili Alatau are found

The introduction of interactive types of education is one of the most important areas for improving the training of students in modern universities
The main methodological innovations today are related to the use of interactive teaching methods
At the same time, the term "interactive learning" is understood in different ways
The very idea of ​ ​ such training arose in the mid-1990s with the advent of the First Web Browser and the beginning of the development of the Internet, and a number of specialists interpret this concept as Training using computer networks and Internet resources
You can give a broader understanding of how to interact with something (for example, with a computer) or with someone (person) or be in dialogue mode
The learning process, based on the application of interactive learning methods, is organized taking into account the inclusion of all students of the group in the learning process
Collaboration means that everyone will make a special personal contribution and share knowledge and ways of working
Individual pair and group work is organized, design work is carried out using role-playing games, work with documents and various sources of information
Interaction of interactive methods Student activity is based on principles of mandatory feedback of group experience
An educational communication environment will be created, which will be characterized by the interaction of participants with transparency, the possibility of mutual assessment and control with the accumulation of joint knowledge with the equality of their arguments
Lead teacher together with new knowledge teaches participants in self-search training
The activity of the teacher allows the activity of students whose task is to create conditions for their initiative
New role of the teacher: the teacher refuses own filter via which he carries out educational information, and one of sources of information serves as the assistant in work
Therefore, interactive learning primarily requires sufficient use of adults in intensive learning

In the context of the transition to the current updated educational program, it is important to have skills in analytical assessment of the teacher's reflexive thinking and self-selection of the educational and methodological base
One of the most appropriate methods of self-organization in the educational activities of any person is reflection
Reflection in pedagogy is the process and result of self-determination of the levels of development of the participants in the pedagogical process themselves
The use of reflexive experience in the educational process will make it possible to establish effective intersectoral relations in the student-teacher system
Reflexive processes in the teacher's professional activity arise when directly communicating with a student when planning and building a lesson, as well as when conducting introspection and self-esteem

Sociocultural development of modernity requires the presence of incorrect non-standard mental qualities, not limited only to the set of classical knowledge
Teacher should play leading role in developing student's research skills
The study is considered in the same direction as the responsible attitude to learning in a business student
The main tool that carries out the understanding of the material submitted for research is the explanation of the teacher
This rule requires the creation and development of a system of research work, which is complicated when moving from class-class
Therefore, educational research should further develop the knowledge received by students as a result of the active cognitive activity of the teacher.
After that, attention to educational and research work, which forms the independence of the cognitive actions of students, can be called one of the main conditions for organizing the educational process
Its implementation requires the search for methods and forms of effective organization of educational and research work that contributes to the cognitive activity of students in school

Fisheries in the country account for only 05% of our economy
Fisheries are developing every year, but state support is needed
Fisheries and its development are of high importance for Kazakhstan
First, the country cannot go to sea and the oceans of the "ninth territory"
Secondly, we have great demand for fish meat not only in the country, but also abroad
For example, fisheries today use 3 million hectares of land
Thirdly, fish meat is good for human health and has a large crop
However, problematic issues in fisheries can be divided into several groups
Firstly, water in some lakes is depleted and becomes less
The second question is very few aquaculture specialists
State grants are allocated annually for ichthyological specialty
However, certified specialists do not visit the fishery or young specialists are not qualified
One of the problems impeding the development of fish is the cultivation of fish in dam farms, as well as helminths that reduce the quality of fish found in natural reservoirs
Most fish helminthoses do not cause any diseases in humans and animals
However, helminths living parasitically in fish cause a particularly dangerous disease when they enter the human body or animals at the larva stage
Therefore, the article provides ways to teach parasites of sick fish in school courses

The reform of school education in the early 2000s was marked by a significant increase in the educational institution (15-2 times) and the predominance of static loads
To determine the reaction of the student's body to the effects of dosed physical activity and health conditions, it is important to evaluate its functional state, in particular the cardiorespiratory system
Under the influence of stable dosed physical activities of students, there is an increase in the functional capabilities of organs and their organ systems, in particular the cardiovascular system
With constant exposure to physical activity in sick and healthy children, the heart rate decreases, which occurs as a result of myocardial savings
Physical development and increase of motor activity of high school students of different physical level were studied

Sivers apple in the territory of the Ile Alatau State National Natural Park is one of the objects requiring special protection and unique
How the gene fund has high value
For today's and future breeding, having deeply studied its species grown in this region, conservation for reforestation and reproduction, the issue is urgent
Sivers apple fruits - very valuable studded fruits are an integral part of the special food menu and are recommended in the treatment of stomach diseases with a lack of drugs
Compared to cultural species, their properties are highly appreciated
Of great interest for breeding, including in the production of dry-resistant and vitamin species
Archives of clones of plus trees - plantations using their vegetative offspring in order to preserve the gene pool and study the hereditary properties of plus trees
When creating archives of clones of positive trees, it takes into account:
when creating archives of clones of plus trees in two or more growing periods, its dimensions are developed by fields (blocks) with separation;
to limit the supply of unnecessary dust, a site for creating a clone archive is placed between plantations of other species, otherwise it requires the creation of filter-protective strips of 5-10 rows of frequent stem trees that grow rapidly in other species that are not intermediate owners of dangerous pests and fungal diseases
The article is devoted to the study of these issues

Pancreas - gland of external and internal secretion
As a pancreas, it releases pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes
Pancreatic cells release insulin hormone into blood
External section refers to bubble-tubular glands with structure of nervous part
The final part of the pancreas is vesicular
Exhaust rods emanating from them form the main iron core
Pancreatic rod opens to duodenum
The endocrine part of the pancreas is made up of pancreatic (langergans) intervals
They have a round or oval shape in different chalk parts
Mixtures A B D and RP are divided into several types
The most common B cells, forming the hormone insulin, reduce the amount of glucose in the blood and convert it to glycogen
Glucagon hormone forming cells A, on the contrary, turns into glycogenic glucose and donates it to the blood
D cells occur in small amounts
Hormone of these cells inhibits the formation of A cell hormones
D cells secrete pancreatic release-enhancing hormone that reduces blood pressure
PP cell hormone
regulates pancreatic formation
Pancreatic head, which is flatulence, is integrated into nodes [1]

Drinking carbonated drinks in young people causes global problems
Consumption of these drinks by young people does not decrease in Kazakhstan
Scientists have studied that drinking carbonated drinks has a negative impact on health
During the study, it was found that the drink contains mixtures harmful to the body: orthophosphoric acid, cocaine caffeine dyes that give color to the drink
In the composition of paints, carcinogenic buckwheat alloys and formaldehyde leading to cancer - this release of methyl alcohol turning into carcinogen has a harmful effect on the body [1-6]
For example, Professor Z
Under the leadership of Tungyshbayeva, a number of studies were conducted in which it was found that the chronic impact of Coca Cola on the organizational structure of the kidneys and lungs causes changes in these organs.
The above additives in the composition of coca-bronze showed that changes in cellular level in kidney and liver structures lead to the development of parenchio- matous protein-drop dystrophy [7-9]

Kazakhstan is a state rich in natural water resources
In addition, the country has created favourable conditions for the development of fisheries
Fish are of great professional importance
Fishing in natural reservoirs to provide fish for the population is carried out as work in each region of the country
The relevance of growing commercial fish retinas of valuable fish species is determined by a sharp decrease in their reserves in natural reservoirs
These issues remain in line with the commodity stock forecast
In this regard, it became possible to organize scientific and practical measures aimed at the development of commercial fish production and designed to preserve the gene pool of valuable fish species
Currently known about the content of valuable fish caught in the fishery
Some species of fish listed in the Red Book are issued on the territory of Kazakhstan

The article tells about the nature and history of the origin of beer
The root of biotechnology for the production of yeast and soft drinks begins with saxons and Celts
Beer, of course, was one of the first known alcoholic beverages of civilization, but the exact date of its release is not determined.
Historical monuments indicate that in Mesopotamia 6,000 years ago, beer was made from bread specially prepared for this purpose; bread soaked barley and trembled this mixture
Beer - the general name of the copper sweater and toxin obtained without distillation, including fermentation of all toxic and toxic liquids based on grain
Beer is widespread in many countries of the world and popular due to its taste and aroma
Historians play a role in the evolution of human love of beer from a society of nomadic hunters and gatherers to an agrarian society developing evolution
Man, knowing the harvest of grain plants, began to eat the harvest of grain; bread and beer were one of the first food products of farmers
True, data indicate that the brewery began shortly after people began growing grain crops for bread production

Specially protected natural territories of the Republic of Kazakhstan are ecologically valuable and culturally valuable national wealth
The main type of specially protected natural areas is state nature reserves
Reserves are among the scientific institutions
All natural wealth on the territory of the reserve is under strict protection and without any economic work, only research work is carried out
The main goal of the reserves - the preservation of the standard of natural landscapes together with the existing plant and animal world in this zone - not only reveals the patterns of natural development of natural complexes, but also predicts changes in nature from human economic activity
There are currently 10 reserves in Kazakhstan
Total area of reserves in Kazakhstan - 1,610,973
This suggests that the volume of reserves for the Republic of Kazakhstan is still small
The only reserve in the west of Kazakhstan is the Ustirt reserve

In recent years, the climate on Earth has undergone significant changes: some countries suffer from rising temperatures, and others suffer from too strong and snowy winters, familiar to the area
According to the concept of environmentalists, global climate change is caused, among other things, by an increase in the average annual temperature, leading to melting glaciers and rising oceans
There is an imbalance in all natural systems except warming, which leads to changes in precipitation patterns and temperature fluctuations and an increase in extreme events such as storm flooding and drought
According to scientists, the average temperature of the planet in the ten months of 2015 was above 102 ° C, established in the 19th century (since the beginning of observation of the change in global temperature)
For the first time in modern history, the threshold of degree is exceeded
Scientists associate these processes with the negative effect of humans - the burning of petroleum gas and coal
- this leads to the greenhouse effect, which led to an increase in the average temperature

In this article, the targeted nature of active mountain tourism differs from many activities of other types of tourism
In this regard, one of the most important practical tasks in many types of tourism is the creation of camping programs and optimal directions
Requires the creation of the principles of route technologies, especially for traditional types of tourism, since it does not need to create the same directions for all types of tourism
On the territory of Kazakhstan there are several mountain zones convenient for active tourist mountain trips of various complexity categories
These are parts of the Western North Central Tien Shan Altai and the Dzungar mountain region
In tourist and geographical literature, within the framework of the western Tien Shan, Chatkal Chandalash connects with the Talas Alatau Range through the Pisky Mandaytal Ogem mountain ranges with the intermountain depressions of Fergana and Atoinak
Mountain hikes of medium complexity can be organized along the Western Tien Shan mountain range
In these mountain zones, it is difficult to build third-category mountain hiking trails
But conducting complex mountain trips of category 1-2 on these mountain ranges meets all the requirements
On a wide scale, tourism covers many types of travel, such as fairly sustainable (balneological tourism ski recreation) and shuttle (nature-oriented sports tourism - cognitive tourism)

This article is intended to improve the catalytic properties of modified iron oxide catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
Based on iron oxide, dehydrogenating catalysts with alkali-earth metal oxide (Zp Nb) as a potassium stabilizer as a stabilizer are created
Activity and selectivity of catalysts in synthesis of styrene at temperature 550-650 ° C in inert medium is studied.
It was noted that the modification of the catalyst with the addition of zirconium and niobium oxides led to a significant increase in the activity of catalysts with Fe-Cr
It has been found that the zirconium oxide and niobium compound reduce the total activity of the basic catalyst, but at the same time suppress the formation of auxiliary products in the form of benzene and toluene
Maximum selectivity for styrene is observed when using a catalyst system with a zirconium oxide compound of 954%
The addition of zirconium and niobium oxides to iron oxide significantly increases the electron exchange rate of Fe2 + -Fe3 +, thereby contributing to the oxidation-oxidation mechanism of catalysis
They also exclude the formation of potassium polyferrites, and during the topochemical reaction of hematite with potassium carbonate, mainly potassium monoferrites are formed.
